00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.480
Hey guys, it’s Ro, welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.340
Today I’m gonna be making Adventure Time
Cupcakes! I got so many requests for

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.449
these, so many, like, so, so, so, so, so,
so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so many

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.969
requests for these!

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.789
And I love the cartoon on Cartoon Network,
good job!

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.730
So, today we’re gonna make those adventure
time cupcakes!

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.660
I decided to make Funfetti cupcakes, this
is Funfetti box mix, this is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.149
1 of my favorites, other than rainbow cake!
Doo-doo-doo!

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.199
So I pre-made cupcakes to save some time,
because we’re just gonna focus

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.280
on decorating today. Da-da!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.339
The colors that you will need today will be
white frosting, tan frosting for

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.579
their skin color, for like princess bubblegum.
Blue frosting, teal frosting

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.639
for Beemo! And orange!

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:08.780
I am going to dip all of my cupcakes. You
take 1 like this, you microwave it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.880
for about 10 seconds, and then, dip! Just
straight down, straight up.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.820
Sometimes accidents happen, but that’s OK,
let’s see if we did it!

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
Oh yeah! And it just makes your cupcake look
really, really smooth, and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700
that’s what you want!

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.530
Look at the Ice King, it looks like his nose!

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130
I don’t even have to make 1! Perfect!

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.200
And you’re gonna do this with all of your
cupcakes.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.180
Now for Finn, we’re gonna be doing something
a little bit different, you’re

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.180
gonna take your cupcake, and take 2 little
marshmallows, and 2 toothpicks.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.340
And you’re gonna stick him on the ear, just
a little bit, and stick him into

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.240
the cupcake.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.030
And now, Finn is ready to dip. Merp!

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.999
Then for Lumpy Space Princess we’re gonna
do something a little bit different,

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.670
you’re gonna take purple frosting, I left
it in the can, and we’re just gonna

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.010
spray it on top of the cupcake, because she’s
lumpy, she’s got a lot of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.830
lady lumps, so, we’re just gonna spread
it out by hand.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.890
This looks like brains.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.140
Now that we have all the cupcakes dipped,
we’re gonna start decorating them.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.580
Starting with my favorite! Lumpy Space Princess!
Oh my glob!

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.180
I found the cutest sparkles, they’re little
star sparkles, sprinkles?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.480
You’re just gonna take the little star sprinkle,
and put it right at the top.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
Oh my glob, it’s so cute! Now I’m gonna
be making her face with black frosting.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
And it’s just in this plastic bag with the teeniest
black tip that I could find.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.330
Because their eyes and facial features are
so small.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.640
Now we are gonna make Jake the doggie! Um,
I got Smartees, the candy,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.350
at the store, and we’re gonna be using the
white Smartees for his eyes.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.490
And then for the rest oh him, we’re just
gonna use more orange frosting

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.310
and black frosting for details.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.750
Now we are going to make Beemo! With this
teal cupcake.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.860
And all you’re gonna need, blue Airhead
for the screen, yellow Starburst.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.400
I found these little, they’re kind of like
Runts but they’re circles

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.190
and I’m gonna use a red circle for her big
button.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.650
And I have green and blue for the little buttons.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.150
Now we’re going to make Ice King!

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.360
All you’re gonna need for the Ice King,
is I got 2 yellow Starbursts for his

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.960
crown, there are 3 of these little red candies,
I found them at Michael’s

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.090
they were, um, in the candy section, I don’t
know…

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.730
Just anything round and little, I think you
can use anything.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.230
And white Airheads.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.160
Now we’re gonna be making Bubblegum Princess!
The things you will need:

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.370
I got 2 Airheads, these are flavor strawberry
banana, and it’s just a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.400
really light pink color and it just reminds
me of the color of her hair,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.460
and I thought that that was the best 1.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.620
And then, blue candy pearls. These are the kind of
fancy, edible pearls that

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.150
people usually put on wedding cakes. But I’m
gonna use that for the little

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.670
gem on her crown, and then, a yellow Starburst
for her crown.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.190
We’re gonna roll this out.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.240
Oh my glob! I finished them, they’re so
cute, and I had so much fun doing these

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.620
that I was like, I have to do more! So I’m
doing Rainicorn and the logo,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.290
I decided to add 2 extra little pieces.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.970
So, ta-da! Let’s start with the Unicorn.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:08.500
I got 6 cupcakes, I frosted them blue so they
look like clouds, and,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.400
I was at The Sweet Factory and I love this,
it’s rainbow candy rope.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.930
And we’re gonna wrap it all the way around.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.690
To make our Rainicorn!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.380
With the extra batter, I had so much Funfetti
batter, I made this little cake.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.880
And it’s just, a 1, 1 level cake, And then I
put fondant all the way around it,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.090
and then I took buttercream frosting and made
like a cloud shape, for the logo.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.270
For the Adventure Time letters, the only time
I used fondant is I cut these

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.990
letters out of the fondant and tried to make
them look as much like the font

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.820
that they use on the show. And I even made,
out of fondant, the little sword.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.460
And for these 2 gems I used little pieces
of candy.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.240
Let’s put it all together!

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.530
Boom! Adventure Time Cupcakes!

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.890
They’re so cute! My favorite is still Lumpy
Space Princess, she’s so cute,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.660
oh my glob, she’s so cute!

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.950
Thanks you guys for watching I finally did
this! The most requested

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.020
Nerdy Nummies that I’ve ever had, so I hope
