00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 It is self-care of the sword Jiang Hu 2 peeled off in 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:14.790
 It's has led from the ear of Tteyuu arms 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.560
 When you do so by are you've thought to Fu Tteyuu it has grown because there is everyone arm 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.590
 The scapula and clavicle are fixed yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.770
 The upper arm moves only from here onwards 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.400
 The important thing is from Ella 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.080
 Since Te is based on a bridge pectoral fin frog hand grows from the gills also scoop also came Tei masu contains the hand from the face 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.710
 A form that comes 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.540
 Dare I Is'm useless Ville of Te look-from the original gills 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 What is the arm with developed pectoral fin ? 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.770
 A building deep sea shark 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.550
 Sharks will have Oh Tteyuu walking down the chest Ville as foot 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.129
 At 8 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:05.720
 The big problem is that I am affirming here and moving my shoulders so hard. 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:11.930
 And the pectoral muscles are really angry, but because of this bad movement everyone is in the order of back and front 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.540
 It means that the pump activity is not working well For that purpose, move the pectoris muscle well 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 You mean 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:23.520
 It says that the pectoralis major muscle a very important and although Abu in the lead from it arm 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.710
 In connection to the antimicrobial to the clavicle ear 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 It is that there is a need to move the cormorant Anou arm 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.010
 I'm really doing it from the earlobe, but when I go about my armor arm 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 First, how the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.460
 Condition This also works the large chest muscle 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.810
 Please go before is in over 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.229
 Always the person 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 It is your Jobu at 6 I do not in the person from it 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:55.340
 The arm connected from the ear 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.170
 Kokkara cormorant is tough clavicle also moves well scapula also move move the arc bone and either move the grass bone 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.530
 Have not you 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.740
 Do not move from the center of the middle 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:10.410
 That air from the ear 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:16.160
 It's important to move It feels like the arm is passing the whole over the rib 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:20.000
 Move up and down It is important before and after this 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:27.810
 It's not about bringing up the founding bone 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:36.840
 Also movement is a Daisetsu Then Kengo bone to move well the pectoralis major muscle 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:43.650
 The whole arm N glue This is also the large pectoral muscle from the ear in which to move and then increase back once before and after 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.350
 It is not going to that Tteyuu pectoralis major muscle also Come on bone also move to move the Repeat this 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.310
 I will 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.489
 23 c I'm fine before 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.489
 Good 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.860
 It's good, then it's big round 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.120
 You sell 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:07.030
 Even if it is only the place where you have 5 ears 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:15.940
 You may be aware of it at all, but you should have arms from high school 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:21.650
 I move from the scapula by moving the pectoralis major from here 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:27.160
 When we move by saying that gloom blue green 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:34.810
 It is to see it you know you fall you down is better here 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:38.720
 If the arm is also in front of the large pectoral muscle that has improved as well as the pectoral muscles are released 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.270
 There's more here, but if it's open it will pull you down 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.690
 Both sides are 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.770
 It means that you do not get nervous 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.540
 Kedomo because IV IV is to say that I'll Put the guys chest with such title that's it 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:55.209
 After all it is pulled down by gravity, so the donation is spring or this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.069
 Greater pectoral muscles and then parallel gold 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.209
 But 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:06.150
 It is a form of being released more than the other side 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:08.490
 I think that the condition of the shoulder is different at all compared with this I think that the state of the shoulder is totally different then the movement of the shoulder 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.910
 You difference at all 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.920
 It is this I That's when both there at once 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.100
 Up and down 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.970
 Upper and lower arms upper and lower arms 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.120
 From the ear 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:30.380
 It's been a lot since then 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.380
 Queen game 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:39.920
 Since then, partial scene 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.890
 Back and forth 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:49.040
 Cormorant Runtte say the case for at ear double screwdriver 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:55.220
 Grouping rounds after knowing 123 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.140
 That is to say is in the form Tteyuu guru This is called the scapula many times open now how 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.260
 You beat the way you 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.440
 But a healthy breast comes to stand a jerk 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:12.950
 Startle spreads and my breathing gets rough 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:14.630
 A very large arms Daimune muscle pectoralis major muscle to move even shoulder blades to the main without'm moving the scapula 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:21.710
 Because it is a muscle to move 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:23.430
 I move the large pectoral muscle a lot- where I moved from today and connect it to the arm by the cooperation from the ear 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.190
 So big 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.639
 2 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.650
 It will have to Daisetsu that say move 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:37.030
 And strengthens open and makes breathing easier 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.030
 Please try it by all means
