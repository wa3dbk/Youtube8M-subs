 heil hi to all here ceyrac and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to this second episode of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 retro video presentations and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.400
 today I prepared you a video 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 most unusual since it is about 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.109
 the first cat video not of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 youtube but of the ladies story and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:37.920
 gentlemen the first cat video of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:39.570
 the history of cats boxing the world 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 was not ready then we talk a little 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 history well before the millions or 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 rather the billions of views when 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 I hear today our sharma all 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.489
 on the net that has more than a century already 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 in 1894 that the directors of this mini 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.719
 film had already decided that the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 would chase the star of the small screen is 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.469
 this this year only after the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.449
 patent filing of the first 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.550
 camera of the story filmed in the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.040
 edison studios by people in full 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.040
 inspiration so the purpose of this video 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.960
 was actually 2 2 me but it did not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
 nonsense that's just bugs cat 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.740
 who's fighting with boxing eras there's more 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.310
 than to add music and we get 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 required 7 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.710
 no but actually in reality it's 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.600
 just guys who are told and ya 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.000
 jérôme if we were going to film waste with 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.800
 boxing gloves as the first video 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.600
 of cat was born and seriously this 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.790
 video was part of the mini movies d 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.740
 edison who notes the scope film a series 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.330
 gathering several thousand film 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.950
 a few minutes on everything and anything 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.450
 what were then shown at the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.399
 public thanks to a machine 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 revolutionary at the time the 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.390
 kinetoscope hence its name a machine that 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.100
 actually gave the possibility of 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.350
 project movies 2 several minutes 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.060
 shot beforehand thanks to the physio at 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.679
 graffiti a machine just as 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.780
 revolutionary she too so basically 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.759
 we had the camera next door the physio at 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.369
 graff and the host projector the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.259
 kinetoscope some 70 films have as well 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.429
 been shot and projected through these two 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.080
 machines between 1891 and 1896 some 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.970
 are still known to our 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.280
 days for their impact at the time as 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.780
 for example the key this mini movie that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 had caused a scandal because 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.760
 saw a man kissing a woman 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.769
 want one of us there are children who 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.300
 look at it and so it's in this heap of 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.890
 videos that appeared another video 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.420
 of cat the gentleman you see 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.250
 besides in the background leaders 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.380
 finally rather doing the fight between the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.209
 cats was named henri whelton he had 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.769
 participated in other films from the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.049
 kinetoscope series the same year 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.610
 like for example cock fights 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.320
 yeah I'm starting to have serious 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.420
 doubts about this production company 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.459
 but good at the same time at the end of the 19th 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.930
 century the animals and the movies it was 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.400
 not really the big love 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.780
 most of the time the only videos 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.100
 of animals that were found to be 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.660
 dogs or cats we know from high 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.519
 for so-called study their 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.530
 movements or a horse that 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.730
 ran to find out if attention to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 existential questions 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.780
 whether or not he had these four hooves in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.430
 the air during his race but my laugh 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.660
 not there was really a whole debate 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.220
 on it at the time and he had 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.230
 really had to wait for the first 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.640
 films to slice meet when 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.440
 down they remove 4 changed my life yeah 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.510
 I also sow to return to our 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.609
 video and although we bring it to 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.079
 final and well the existential answer to 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.860
 the big question what is the meaning of 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.870
 life of course 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.280
 bringing back seriously we can say that 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.750
 it's an essential element in 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.430
 the feline story on the screen one can 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.650
 besides say that this video is the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.810
 basic videos of cats the viral base 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.820
 vps has been updated 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.260
 but it's not a video that will remain 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.880
 in memories as a good moment 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.130
 glorious in the history of humanity 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.110
 but rather an unusual moment where 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.030
 the man decided for the first time to 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.480
 put his camera and his eyes on the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.800
 future master of the internet the cat he gets 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.959
 nearly a century up front his 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.890
 premonition serious gay couples you 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.200
 believe that the most videos 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.080
 today what is the podcasts the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.700
 video chat unsealed cultural videos 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.670
 it's still a thing of whew 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.070
 why cats 1 why why 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.959
 well I'll let you meditate on it 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.550
 in the comments on this thanks to 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.900
 all of having followed this video and we 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.690
 is coming soon for a new 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.690
 video on hang well on the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.810
 but it does not preclude
