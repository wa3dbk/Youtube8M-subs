00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.510 

okay<00:03:49.660> now<00:03:50.020> we<00:03:50.080> finished<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> flat<00:03:50.890> twist<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
as you see we've given it a little curve

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.190 
as you see we've given it a little curve
so<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.370> has<00:03:54.520> some<00:03:54.760> direction<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:56.050> also

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
so that has some direction and it also

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.880 
so that has some direction and it also
makes<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.830> soft<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.660> flat<00:03:58.930> twists<00:03:59.350> keeps

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
makes it soft and the flat twists keeps

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.040 
makes it soft and the flat twists keeps
everything<00:04:00.160> in<00:04:00.400> place<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.900> don't

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
everything in place so that you don't

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.550 
everything in place so that you don't
have<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.560> move<00:04:03.100> hair<00:04:03.459> around<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:04.410> next<00:04:05.410> what

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
have to move hair around and next what

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.050 
have to move hair around and next what
we're<00:04:05.709> going<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.890> do<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.700> we're<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:06.970> to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.360 
we're going to do is we're going to
learn<00:04:07.180> how<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.510> do<00:04:07.870> an<00:04:08.110> individual<00:04:08.709> twist<00:04:09.069> and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
the difference between the individual

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.540 
the difference between the individual
twists<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.140> flat<00:04:11.410> twists<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.069> an

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
twists and a flat twists is an

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.809 
twists and a flat twists is an
individual<00:04:13.420> twists<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:13.959> loose<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:15.370> doesn't

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
individual twists is loose it doesn't

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.640 
individual twists is loose it doesn't
lay<00:04:16.000> along<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.480> scalp<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.470> like<00:04:17.620> a

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
lay along the scalp and so it's like a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.130 
lay along the scalp and so it's like a
braid<00:04:18.070> where<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.609> comes<00:04:18.880> loose<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.540> it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
braid where it just comes loose and it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.020 
braid where it just comes loose and it
allows<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.859> really<00:04:21.310> move<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.730> hair

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
allows you to really move that hair

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.930 
allows you to really move that hair
round<00:04:22.320> style<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.830> can<00:04:23.980> do<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.130> pinup<00:04:24.460> you

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
round style it you can do a pinup you

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.580 
round style it you can do a pinup you
can<00:04:25.090> make<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.360> really<00:04:25.510> curly<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.230> can<00:04:26.350> pull

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
can make it really curly you can pull

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.230 
can make it really curly you can pull
some<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.950> drop<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.400> face<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> have

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
some of the drop in the face so you have
