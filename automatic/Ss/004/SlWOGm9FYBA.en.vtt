makers<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> add<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:50.969> items<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.260> they

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
makers can add two items so that they

what<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.039> done<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> gate<00:00:57.210> heat

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
what I have done here with the gate heat

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.610 
what I have done here with the gate heat
so<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.199> only<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.590> placed<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.160> glass<00:00:59.760> panes

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
so it can only be placed on glass panes

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.979 
so it can only be placed on glass panes
when<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:01.980> place<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> item<00:01:03.030> frame<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.809> are

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
when I do place the item frame there are

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600 
when I do place the item frame there are
some<00:01:04.229> command<00:01:04.589> blocks<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> spawn<00:01:05.580> chunks

unlocked and this is the place where the

redstone block is set the reason why we

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
have it being set to a different

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.199 
have it being set to a different
location<00:03:03.440> instead<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.549> having<00:03:04.880> one

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
location instead of just like having one

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.570 
location instead of just like having one
animation<00:03:05.569> for<00:03:05.959> all<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.410> gates<00:03:06.650> because

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
animation for all of the gates because

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.710 
animation for all of the gates because
each<00:03:07.790> gate<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.269> located<00:03:08.870> at<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.080> different<00:03:09.410> spot

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
each gate is located at a different spot

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.270 
each gate is located at a different spot
so<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.750> felt<00:03:12.140> like<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.500> hard<00:03:12.739> coding<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.160> in

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
so I felt like just hard coding it in

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.520 
so I felt like just hard coding it in
and<00:03:13.519> having<00:03:14.330> each<00:03:14.600> gate<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.290> its<00:03:15.440> own

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and having each gate have its own

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.349 
and having each gate have its own
animation<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:18.709> bottom<00:03:19.100> command<00:03:19.400> block<00:03:19.609> sets

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
animation this bottom command block sets

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.599 
animation this bottom command block sets
the<00:03:20.690> redstone<00:03:21.079> block<00:03:21.260> right<00:03:21.470> here<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> wall

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
the redstone block right here to a wall

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.910 
the redstone block right here to a wall
block<00:03:22.850> this<00:03:23.660> makes<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.140> easier<00:03:24.440> for<00:03:24.769> me<00:03:24.890> to

block this makes it easier for me to
reset<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.850> map<00:03:26.030> because<00:03:26.720> instead<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.440> having

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
reset the map because instead of having

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.050 
reset the map because instead of having
a<00:03:27.769> constant<00:03:28.160> signal<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.790> creates<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.900> pulse

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
a constant signal it creates a pulse

sound it plays the sound of kind of like
sounds<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.790> clicking<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.540> lock<00:03:38.840> open<00:03:39.340> which

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
sounds like clicking a lock open which

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.979 
sounds like clicking a lock open which

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
in a moment but essentially it is making

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.129 
in a moment but essentially it is making
it<00:04:13.010> look<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.700> gate<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.389> actually<00:04:14.900> being

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
it look like the gate is actually being

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.219 
it look like the gate is actually being
pulled<00:04:15.560> down<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:17.510> command<00:04:17.870> block<00:04:18.019> right

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
pulled down and this command block right

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.170 
pulled down and this command block right
here<00:04:18.260> makes<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.950> sound<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.789> gate<00:04:19.970> is

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
here makes it sound like the gate is

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.960 
here makes it sound like the gate is
being<00:04:20.419> pulled<00:04:20.690> down<00:04:21.490> it<00:04:22.490> does<00:04:22.729> this<00:04:22.909> by

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
being pulled down it does this by

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.560 
being pulled down it does this by
playing<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.750> piston<00:04:24.260> retraction<00:04:25.070> sound<00:04:25.370> at<00:04:25.640> a

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
playing the piston retraction sound at a

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.080 
playing the piston retraction sound at a
low

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
low

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.360 
low
or<00:04:27.150> pitch<00:04:27.389> which<00:04:28.020> makes<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.500> sound<00:04:28.740> more

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
or pitch which makes it sound more

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.110 
or pitch which makes it sound more
metallic<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.660> grindy<00:04:31.820> adjust<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.910> gate

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
metallic and grindy adjust the gate

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.350 
metallic and grindy adjust the gate
being<00:04:33.449> pulled<00:04:33.960> down<00:04:34.610> after<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.639> few<00:04:35.910> more<00:04:36.090> tix

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
being pulled down after a few more tix

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.080 
being pulled down after a few more tix
it<00:04:36.660> will<00:04:36.990> clone<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.590> next<00:04:38.010> frame<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.760> make<00:04:38.910> the

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
it will clone the next frame to make the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.210 
it will clone the next frame to make the
gate<00:04:39.270> like<00:04:39.479> look<00:04:39.840> like<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.229> even<00:04:40.590> lower<00:04:40.800> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
gate like look like it is even lower and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.939 
gate like look like it is even lower and
then<00:04:42.030> after<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.449> few<00:04:42.540> more<00:04:42.870> tix<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.530> will<00:04:43.770> make

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
then after a few more tix it will make

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.530 
then after a few more tix it will make
the<00:04:44.100> gate<00:04:44.310> look<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:44.850> completely<00:04:45.510> gone

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
the gate look like it is completely gone

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.490 
the gate look like it is completely gone
and<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:47.460> will<00:04:47.550> play<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.910> sound<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.500> metal

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
and it will play the sound of metal

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.530 
and it will play the sound of metal
clinking<00:04:50.070> which<00:04:50.550> makes<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:50.970> sound<00:04:51.150> like<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
clinking which makes it sound like the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.070 
clinking which makes it sound like the
gate<00:04:51.720> has<00:04:51.990> reached<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.590> bottom<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:54.750> create

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
gate has reached the bottom to create

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.990 
gate has reached the bottom to create
the<00:04:55.260> illusion<00:04:55.470> that<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.919> gate<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.280> actually

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
the illusion that the gate is actually

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.390 
the illusion that the gate is actually
moving<00:04:57.180> downward<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:58.020> show<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.949> player<00:04:59.160> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
moving downward I show the player a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.680 
moving downward I show the player a
series<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.440> frames<00:05:01.440> or<00:05:01.830> images<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:03.450> first

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
series of frames or images the first

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.450 
series of frames or images the first
image<00:05:03.930> they<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.169> is<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.620> gay<00:05:04.800> being<00:05:05.070> closed

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
image they see is the gay being closed

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.240 
image they see is the gay being closed
but<00:05:06.120> then<00:05:06.240> once<00:05:06.479> they<00:05:06.660> unlock<00:05:07.020> it<00:05:07.260> they<00:05:07.950> very

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
but then once they unlock it they very

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.120 
but then once they unlock it they very
quickly<00:05:08.580> see<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.870> image<00:05:10.200> which<00:05:10.560> makes<00:05:10.590> it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
quickly see this image which makes it

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.030 
quickly see this image which makes it
look<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.850> seem<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.169> gate<00:05:13.440> has<00:05:13.680> slid

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
look and seem like the gate has slid

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.840 
look and seem like the gate has slid
down<00:05:14.550> by<00:05:15.210> one<00:05:15.540> block<00:05:16.280> but<00:05:17.280> then<00:05:17.430> very<00:05:17.639> quickly

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
down by one block but then very quickly

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.090 
down by one block but then very quickly
after<00:05:18.150> they<00:05:18.419> see<00:05:18.479> this<00:05:18.810> one<00:05:19.080> they<00:05:19.620> see<00:05:19.680> this

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
after they see this one they see this

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.590 
after they see this one they see this
one<00:05:20.340> which<00:05:20.490> makes<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:20.880> look<00:05:21.060> like<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.389> gate

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
one which makes it look like the gate

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.230 
one which makes it look like the gate
has<00:05:21.810> slid<00:05:22.169> down<00:05:22.410> even<00:05:22.889> more<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.400> then<00:05:24.210> after

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
has slid down even more and then after

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.480 
has slid down even more and then after
that<00:05:24.780> they<00:05:25.020> see<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.470> gate<00:05:25.680> being<00:05:26.039> completely

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
that they see the gate being completely

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.659 
that they see the gate being completely
opened<00:05:27.030> but<00:05:27.900> because<00:05:28.350> it<00:05:28.560> happens<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.130> quickly

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
opened but because it happens so quickly

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.990 
opened but because it happens so quickly
the<00:05:30.600> brain<00:05:30.840> sort<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.500> fills<00:05:31.979> in<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.190> gaps<00:05:32.639> to

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
the brain sort of fills in the gaps to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.480 
the brain sort of fills in the gaps to
make<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.780> seem<00:05:34.050> like<00:05:34.080> it's<00:05:34.440> all<00:05:34.620> one<00:05:34.950> solid

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
make it seem like it's all one solid

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.690 
make it seem like it's all one solid
movement<00:05:36.330> or<00:05:36.479> motion<00:05:37.110> creates<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.490> illusion

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
movement or motion creates the illusion

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.820 
movement or motion creates the illusion
of<00:05:38.910> motion<00:05:39.120> that<00:05:39.780> with<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.350> play<00:05:40.530> sound

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
of motion that with the play sound

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.940 
of motion that with the play sound
commands<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.570> can<00:05:42.570> create<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> pretty<00:05:43.229> realistic

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
commands I can create a pretty realistic

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.010 
commands I can create a pretty realistic
feeling<00:05:44.400> that<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:44.849> gate<00:05:45.060> is<00:05:45.090> actually<00:05:45.660> being

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
feeling that the gate is actually being

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.210 
feeling that the gate is actually being
slid<00:05:46.500> downward<00:05:47.090> to<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.210> opened<00:05:49.190> now<00:05:50.190> I

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
slid downward to be opened now I

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.640 
slid downward to be opened now I
actually<00:05:50.610> did<00:05:51.120> this<00:05:51.300> using<00:05:51.660> cloned<00:05:52.169> commands

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
actually did this using cloned commands

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.310 
actually did this using cloned commands
so<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.639> have<00:05:53.910> a<00:05:53.940> template<00:05:54.570> in<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:55.020> spawn<00:05:55.289> chunks

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
so I have a template in the spawn chunks

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.850 
so I have a template in the spawn chunks
of<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:56.010> gate<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.550> then<00:05:57.510> I<00:05:57.570> clone<00:05:58.050> each<00:05:58.410> one<00:05:58.740> of

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
of a gate and then I clone each one of

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.190 
of a gate and then I clone each one of
the<00:05:58.919> different<00:05:59.250> frames<00:05:59.580> from<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.690> gate<00:06:00.930> so

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
the different frames from that gate so

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.659 
the different frames from that gate so
each<00:06:01.349> one<00:06:01.530> of<00:06:01.560> these<00:06:01.710> different<00:06:01.919> images<00:06:02.520> I

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
each one of these different images I

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.010 
each one of these different images I
clone<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.349> to<00:06:04.349> the<00:06:04.590> location<00:06:05.070> of<00:06:05.160> the<00:06:05.340> gate

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
clone that to the location of the gate

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.140 
clone that to the location of the gate
that's<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.229> for<00:06:07.440> this<00:06:07.530> video<00:06:07.710> I<00:06:08.099> hope<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:09.030> was

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
that's it for this video I hope it was

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.790 
that's it for this video I hope it was
enjoyable<00:06:09.599> and<00:06:09.870> I<00:06:09.960> hope<00:06:10.139> that<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.440> learned<00:06:10.650> a

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
enjoyable and I hope that you learned a
