tortugas standard-issue phaser
so<00:00:25.929> I<00:00:25.960> based<00:00:26.349> standard-issue<00:00:27.009> phaser<00:00:27.400> on<00:00:27.669> a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
so I based standard-issue phaser on a

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.149 
so I based standard-issue phaser on a
classic<00:00:28.179> phase<00:00:28.449> 90<00:00:28.749> but<00:00:29.140> an<00:00:29.289> old<00:00:29.499> one<00:00:29.829> the<00:00:30.009> one

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:30.159 
classic phase 90 but an old one the one

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.679 
classic phase 90 but an old one the one
that's<00:00:30.279> got<00:00:30.519> less<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.089> that<00:00:31.119> upper<00:00:31.509> mid-range

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
that's got less of that upper mid-range

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.890 
that's got less of that upper mid-range
nasally<00:00:32.470> kind<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.860> yeah<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:34.000> never<00:00:34.390> liked<00:00:34.690> out

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
nasally kind of yeah I never liked out

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900 
nasally kind of yeah I never liked out
of<00:00:34.989> phasers<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.620> it's<00:00:35.980> got<00:00:36.129> more<00:00:36.280> warmth<00:00:36.789> and

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
of phasers and it's got more warmth and

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.000 
of phasers and it's got more warmth and
richness<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.600> almost<00:00:38.260> like<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.559> rotating

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
richness to it almost like a rotating

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.920 
richness to it almost like a rotating
speaker<00:00:39.250> thick<00:00:39.550> but<00:00:39.699> not<00:00:39.730> quite<00:00:40.270> because<00:00:40.629> for

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
speaker thick but not quite because for

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.840 
speaker thick but not quite because for
that<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.230> should<00:00:41.410> buy<00:00:41.559> a<00:00:41.590> Neptune<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.489> anyway

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
that you should buy a Neptune but anyway

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.389 
that you should buy a Neptune but anyway
this<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:43.960> very<00:00:44.230> cool<00:00:44.469> in<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.829> fact<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.190> you

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
this is very cool in the fact that you

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.520 
this is very cool in the fact that you
have<00:00:45.609> really<00:00:46.149> two<00:00:46.480> identical<00:00:47.230> sets<00:00:47.379> of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
have really two identical sets of

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.049 
have really two identical sets of
controls<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.010> you<00:00:48.129> can<00:00:48.250> switch<00:00:48.460> between<00:00:48.640> so

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
controls and you can switch between so

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.450 
controls and you can switch between so
it's<00:00:49.210> like<00:00:49.329> having<00:00:49.660> 2<00:00:49.840> phasers<00:00:50.109> in<00:00:50.410> one<00:00:50.590> stun

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
it's like having 2 phasers in one stun

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.490 
it's like having 2 phasers in one stun
and<00:00:51.879> kill<00:00:51.910> and<00:00:52.570> yes<00:00:52.719> they<00:00:52.870> are<00:00:52.899> exactly<00:00:53.350> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
and kill and yes they are exactly the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.770 
and kill and yes they are exactly the
same<00:00:53.679> force<00:00:54.039> and<00:00:54.370> with<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:55.179> each<00:00:55.359> one<00:00:55.570> of<00:00:55.629> them

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
same force and with on each one of them

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.569 
same force and with on each one of them
do<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.109> same<00:00:56.230> things<00:00:56.739> but<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.160> can<00:00:57.309> set<00:00:57.460> them

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
do the same things but you can set them

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.259 
do the same things but you can set them
up<00:00:57.670> however<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:58.030> like

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
up however you like

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.410 
up however you like
force<00:00:59.199> being<00:00:59.469> depth<00:00:59.920> with<00:01:00.489> being<00:01:00.850> rate<00:01:01.149> but

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
force being depth with being rate but

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.209 
force being depth with being rate but
those<00:01:01.539> are<00:01:01.690> boring<00:01:02.050> so<00:01:02.079> force<00:01:03.010> them<00:01:03.190> with

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
those are boring so force them with

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.520 
those are boring so force them with
their<00:01:03.550> cooler<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:04.930> instance<00:01:05.199> here's<00:01:05.410> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
their cooler so for instance here's the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:15.190 
their cooler so for instance here's the
guitar<00:01:05.830> unclean<00:01:06.280> by<00:01:06.520> itself

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.020 

let's<00:01:16.200> turn<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> fader

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.520 

turn<00:01:25.030> up<00:01:25.150> our<00:01:25.300> force<00:01:25.690> we<00:01:25.930> get<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.110> little<00:01:26.440> bit

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
turn up our force we get a little bit

00:01:26.530 --> 00:02:07.560 
turn up our force we get a little bit
more<00:01:26.880> back<00:01:27.880> in<00:01:28.090> there<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.880> then<00:02:07.090> you've<00:02:07.360> got<00:02:07.540> a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
more back in there but then you've got a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.000 
more back in there but then you've got a
completely<00:02:08.110> separate<00:02:08.440> channel<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.920> can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
completely separate channel you can

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.800 
completely separate channel you can
switch<00:02:09.280> between<00:02:09.429> on-the-fly<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.450> I<00:02:10.510> like<00:02:10.690> to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
switch between on-the-fly and I like to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
switch between on-the-fly and I like to
set<00:02:10.990> this<00:02:11.110> one<00:02:11.170> up<00:02:11.380> since<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.160> got<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.460> name

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
set this one up since it's got the name

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:56.220 
set this one up since it's got the name
kill<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.530> little<00:02:14.530> bit<00:02:14.680> more<00:02:14.890> drastic<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:55.230> course

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
kill a little bit more drastic of course

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.810 
kill a little bit more drastic of course
it's<00:02:56.410> got<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:56.770> different<00:02:57.310> kinds<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.610> things

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
it's got all different kinds of things

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.520 
it's got all different kinds of things
you<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.150> do<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.540> keep<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.900> depth<00:02:59.230> down

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
you can do you can keep your depth down

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:22.550 
you can do you can keep your depth down
turn<00:02:59.890> your<00:02:59.980> rate<00:03:00.220> up<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.580> get

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.080 

so<00:03:23.560> here's<00:03:23.740> what<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:23.980> sounds<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.820> game

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
so here's what it sounds like on a game

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:34.020 
so here's what it sounds like on a game
down<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.810> here's<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.230> amp<00:03:26.350> by<00:03:26.530> itself<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.820> of

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
down and here's the amp by itself and of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.760 
down and here's the amp by itself and of
course<00:03:34.300> here's<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.600> sound<00:03:34.810> everybody<00:03:35.500> wants

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
course here's the sound everybody wants

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:56.630 
course here's the sound everybody wants
to<00:03:35.800> use<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:36.250> phaser<00:03:36.460> for<00:03:54.630> of<00:03:55.630> course<00:03:55.900> you've

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to use a phaser for of course you've

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.120 
to use a phaser for of course you've
you've<00:03:57.640> always<00:03:57.790> got<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.330> kill<00:03:59.290> channel<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.980> do

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
you've always got the kill channel to do

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:18.110 
you've always got the kill channel to do
cool<00:04:00.490> sounds<00:04:00.880> like<00:04:01.030> this

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.370 

of<00:04:19.120> course<00:04:19.329> can<00:04:19.510> go<00:04:19.600> back<00:04:19.780> together<00:04:19.959> one<00:04:20.230> and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
of course can go back together one and

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.940 
of course can go back together one and
still<00:04:20.590> do<00:04:21.870> or<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.050> if<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.350> want<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.680> because

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
you got the two very cool different

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.810 
you got the two very cool different
channels
