 new motto appeared yesterday and indeed 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:33.410
 a hammer I think it might be the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:33.410
 h 1 1 a 2 1 list has two, after all 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:47.460
 he brings something with us, we have here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.059
 a man can be a wish then 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.059
 do we have 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.550
 it is 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.730
 Yes 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.210
 barrett 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.210
 what's up 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:19.350
 then suitcase of mailing repair 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.950
 we exhaust the front i am going on now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 but he came yesterday not so good 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:38.360
 Mercedes but what still stood 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.360
 racing stables the tires here a hammer 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.929
 this one 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.970
 they see which one looks a bit too 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.860
 modest or wheels with chains 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.200
 then we can only times the stands councils 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.050
 long because the other belongs somehow 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.760
 not how and where they do not have 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.760
 says I'm just doing this 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.400
 look there 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.090
 the worms bisserl gas here 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.299
 however , we understand that deeply in hh 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.980
 by 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.190
 bush 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.190
 through there 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.080
 so that a certain gentleman sees that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.390
 that is possible 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:19.350
 Although, how does not you manage through that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.350
 trees through that is just so hard 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.750
 that's how it is here 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.580
 critical gaps also not at all 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.290
 and you see 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.290
 he is just coincidental 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.250
 damage scores here until now only 8 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.250
 that's just so bad 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:19.150

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.739
 Download and yes we would 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.910
