minutes into the song an amazing guitar

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.150

solo<00:02:43.280> very<00:02:44.030> sparse<00:02:44.660> what<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:45.380> about<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.799> is

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
solo very sparse what I like about it is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.750 
solo very sparse what I like about it is
that<00:02:46.489> he<00:02:47.030> mixes<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.620> sparseness<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.400> his

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that he mixes the sparseness of his

that he mixes the sparseness of his
whole<00:02:50.030> notes<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.599> just<00:02:50.780> letting<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> notes

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
whole notes and just letting the notes

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.220 
whole notes and just letting the notes
ring<00:02:52.220> out<00:02:52.430> with<00:02:53.120> some<00:02:53.359> nice<00:02:53.570> little<00:02:53.959> fast

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
ring out with some nice little fast

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.560 
ring out with some nice little fast
lines<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:55.489> not<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.700> not<00:02:56.090> too<00:02:56.329> aggressive

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570
