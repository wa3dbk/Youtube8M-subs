00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and all that and let the change but I

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
and all that and let the change but I
mean<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> all<00:01:35.939> worked<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> end<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
mean it all worked out in the end but

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
mean it all worked out in the end but
yeah<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.829> rather<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.180> from

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
yeah I just rather just you know go from

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.480 
yeah I just rather just you know go from
start<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.869> finish<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.860> definitely

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
start to finish but it's a definitely

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.280 
start to finish but it's a definitely
unique<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.970> guess<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> same<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.659> everybody<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
unique I guess the same for everybody so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.679 
unique I guess the same for everybody so
it<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.100> worked<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.390> were<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.540> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it all worked out good what were some of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.240 
it all worked out good what were some of
the<00:01:45.810> high<00:01:45.899> points<00:01:46.140> are<00:01:46.380> your<00:01:46.560> 10-minute<00:01:47.040> break

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the high points are your 10-minute break

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889 
the high points are your 10-minute break
i'm<00:01:47.430> assuming<00:01:47.939> tires<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.540> didn't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
i'm assuming tires we didn't have the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
i'm assuming tires we didn't have the
best<00:01:49.290> view<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.430> went<00:01:50.549> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
best view really of what all went on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.520 
best view really of what all went on
down<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.090> yeah<00:01:51.479> tired<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.290> sure<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.439> think

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
down there yeah tired for sure i think

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.960 
down there yeah tired for sure i think
the<00:01:52.770> biggest<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> i<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.549> pee<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the biggest thing is i had to pee so

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.410 
the biggest thing is i had to pee so
that<00:01:54.659> definitely<00:01:54.960> helped<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.030> yeah<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.210> didn't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that definitely helped so yeah we didn't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.490 
that definitely helped so yeah we didn't
really<00:01:57.509> change<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.899> whole<00:01:57.990> lot<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> couple

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
really change a whole lot a couple

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
really change a whole lot a couple
little<00:01:58.590> things<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.219> tires<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.969> fuel<00:02:00.000> and
