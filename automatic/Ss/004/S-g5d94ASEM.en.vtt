00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.279
 8 so weird when filming suddenly 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.340
 think of the answer I did not mean at all 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.299
 so simply recorded came voice 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.000
 decided to see what came of it 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 always surprised that sunday evening 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.770
 people are ready to drive their cars 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.660
 totally not interested in what 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.610
 inside integrity then I asked myself 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.750
 how should the dirtiest cars look 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.270
 how best to show that she is dirty 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.270
 outside but clean inside 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.460
 he kim we needed to remove the ad 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 engine oil with active 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.650
 detergent additives which leaving 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.510
 motor clean sea visit us 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.320
 it was necessary to think of it 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.380
 bagration would have towels we had 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.580
 several ideas we tried not only 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.490
 emphasize the cleaning properties of shell helix but 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.110
 also show that this oil is capable 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.110
 act and in difficult conditions 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.570
 but precisely this indeed 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.550
 impressive at first which is first all 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.290
 race car completely covered in 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 dirt will then suddenly cut it 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.570
 in half 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.340
 and inside is a shining clean engine 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.860
 read trash simple and successful 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.110
 Kopeck's Yan took most of the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.070
 organization of all that was required for this 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.150
 commercials he collected parts to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 machines his team always used 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 shell helix oils so they are happy to present 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.940
 him 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.310
 shell helix man one of the best motor oils 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.049
 in the world 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.759
 oksana works on both 20 degree frost and 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.080
 30 degree heat 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.210
 while this is understandably very important we 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 we want to be the best so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.720
 we use the best Russians 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.340
 for this we needed a simple solution 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.770
 which would allow us to work from the machine 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350
 monarchy divided in half 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.550
 involve a huge amount 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.369
 offset cameras 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.329
 so that I have quite a bit later 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.630
 to retouch the rivers we used mass 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.509
 special effects we did a couple idle 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.490
 runs then cleaned the forests and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969
 sawed the car correspondent such shooting 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:56.649
 must be organized 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.649
 as safe as possible 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.020
 but exactly cutting the car is not so 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.810
 just for all this requires a big 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.400
 precision 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.090
 most of the problems were due to white 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.790
 sandals on the new sediment I myself 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.750
 imagine we needed to 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.250
 huge sang handled with 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.430
 speed of 120 revolutions per minute and one climbed 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.069
 weighs more than a ton 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.560
 provide security here 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.929
 not easy at all 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.019
 everything should be in the commercial 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.119
 shown how me really 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.549
 had to ensure the growth of production 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.029
 fossil and fluttering small 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.299
 pieces of un 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.019
 government today public 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.809
 so spoiled that if you want 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.450
 show something like that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.290
 really need to shoot 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.199
 great 8 if you're fighting 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.129
 half time let's say it's all done 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.699
 on computers and albino no 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.819
 machines they are not cutting very important 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.619
 how do you shoot commercial 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.439
 must not only impress but 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:51.829
 assure
