00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.160

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.300

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.590
 Unfortunately, I do not do anything 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.619

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:58.820

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:06.990
 Range trekking tracking is good though 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.300
 nothing next time not face 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.319
 I play once 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.850

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.850

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.969
 it is ridiculous to do harm 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:55.750
 smooth and not so quiet now 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.750

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.840
 the world 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:48.270
 baker master 70 says again okay myself 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.270
 at least my child killed now 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.040
 I now have multi shot 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.060
 twice 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.730
 now I have no more on the best 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.730
 field unfortunately 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:39.730
 a best one had it himself no 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.730
 Best is not cool 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:57.399
 you can not do it later 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.399
 give 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.470
 I can also handle it myself 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.669
 or I can play left then 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.780
 but I can not bring out a minimal 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.780
 but with my arcane bulkhead 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:06:03.740
 I really needed 18 completely 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:07.930
 I can then just maybe the 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.930
