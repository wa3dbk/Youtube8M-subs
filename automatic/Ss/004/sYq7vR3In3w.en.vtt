00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.440
 hello greedy I hope you 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.630
 go well today we find ourselves 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.910
 not a new tutorial on the theme of 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.470
 disney princesses so let's start 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.119
 to make all the little flowers 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.880
 who will come to rest on our cake 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.640
 so for that you spread a bunch of 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.330
 fine sugar dough you do some 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.270
 strips inside and you go 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.620
 rolled up your little strip so 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.840
 form a small flower we stick 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.380
 the end you bend slightly to the base 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.850
 and it's good you actually do several 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.430
 colors so less colors than 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.970
 I decided to decline his the blue the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.320
 yellow the purple and the pink to stay 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.990
 in the colors of each princess 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.970
 disney where do you do it this way 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.830
 of each color 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.080
 then we will make flowers of a 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.810
 other shape so for that you take some 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.479
 small ejector cookie cutter and you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.910
 cut some flowers inside 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.650
 wanted to drop on a flower moss 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.890
 and with a small bull tool 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 you point in the hollow so as to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.000
 curl the petals so there it is 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.810
 I do the same thing as for the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.979
 first one rolled a lot and it's good 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.540
 see its form as kinds of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.540
 very small roses 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.869
 then in the same way the flowers and 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.610
 this time I'm going to put pearls 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.200
 silvery inside so with 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.000
 the bull tool will curl up you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.520
 petals a little bit of water and some 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 silver beads inside then 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 the butterflies so like to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.690
 punch 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.549
 we cut and then in a box 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.590
 beef we will place them so 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.780
 that evening wings to curves and we're going 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.600
 let it dry for at least an hour or 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.340
 two and this way we will have some 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.630
 pretty butterflies with wings well 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.030
 curled up then we will lose the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.160
 leaves to put next to the flowers 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.480
 so for that of the green sugar dough of 1 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.750
 any piece ejector leaves and you 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 cut out your leaves inside 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.750
 then so that his leaves are 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.519
 also legendary in curve and you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.950
 put on the edge of a plate with 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.940
 from terminals to a plate completely to 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.459
 flat they must have when even 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.330
 edges and wanted to place everything around 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.739
 way to make a light next to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.030
 the rose so I will not show you 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.010
 t all because I have already done a 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.810
 tutorial on the rose I will put the link 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.700
 just one euro so you can 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.470
 go see how we do you go 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.640
 see it's very healthy so here's one time 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.980
 that all our little flowers are in 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.810
 done now we go to the effect 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.459
 quilted on cake so if you have 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 a patchwork you do not step 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.630
 I have no patchwork so I decide 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.859
 to do with a square so you 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.989
 trace in one direction then in the other 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.700
 it's less regular with a choice badge 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.329
 but it makes an effect my place is everything 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.329
 in fact correct 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.660
 and then with a roulade design you 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.620
 iron the lines to make 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.620
 small sewing effect 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.319
 then with a star tool you 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.769
 make points at each intersection 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.269
 small rhombuses 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.469
 so you can put pearls too 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.739
 it's a bit like you want me 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.939
 wanted this to happen when and no 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.129
 as we like as a kind of little 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.650
 nails inside the young stars 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.629
 and then slightly places side by side the base 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.859
 on the cake water and we place the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.450
 crown so for the crown it's 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.739
 like I had already done a tutorial on the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.810
 crown I will put you the link just 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.970
 here so that you can 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.739
 go see how we do you go 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.470
 to see that too is not very complicated 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.539
 then an image so printers 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.900
 food or printer to normal 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:24.030
 as you want and you stuck it on 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.530
 the base of the cake a place after our 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.240
 little flowers so here it is a small 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.580
 little random mans as you want 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.710
 you try that at each home a 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.940
 different color at each place you 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.770
 place flowers must remember the 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.889
 all the colors of the princesses and 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:43.050
 cake see our little roses and the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.550
 butterflies so the butterflies have placed 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.720
 here they are a little bit on the top of the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.389
 cake so that we can see 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.930
 the curvature of the wings and that's it 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.680
 given 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.659
 for the cake ride is for the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.900
 crowned 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:59.190
