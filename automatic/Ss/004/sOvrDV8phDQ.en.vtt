00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910 

my<00:01:08.119> premise<00:01:08.540> here<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:09.140> that<00:01:09.530> we're<00:01:09.799> looking

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
my premise here is that we're looking

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.969 
my premise here is that we're looking
for<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.610> shoulder<00:01:10.940> hip<00:01:11.360> heel<00:01:11.720> vertical<00:01:12.590> line<00:01:12.770> in

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
for a shoulder hip heel vertical line in

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.270 
for a shoulder hip heel vertical line in
the<00:01:13.070> rider<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.030> within<00:01:14.390> our<00:01:14.990> established<00:01:15.979> ways

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the rider so within our established ways

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.359 
the rider so within our established ways
of<00:01:16.520> talking<00:01:16.700> about<00:01:16.940> riding<00:01:17.409> we<00:01:18.409> have<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.920> idea

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
of talking about riding we have the idea

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.840 
of talking about riding we have the idea
of<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.820> shoulder<00:01:20.180> hip<00:01:20.390> vertical<00:01:21.049> line<00:01:21.259> and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
of a shoulder hip vertical line and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.520 
of a shoulder hip vertical line and
everybody's<00:01:22.850> heard<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.180> that<00:01:23.330> but<00:01:24.170> hardly

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
everybody's heard of that but hardly

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.499 
everybody's heard of that but hardly
anybody<00:01:24.860> does<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.399> many<00:01:25.670> people<00:01:25.759> pay<00:01:26.240> lip

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
anybody does it many people pay lip

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.200 
anybody does it many people pay lip
service<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.229> idea<00:01:27.399> but<00:01:28.399> hardly<00:01:28.820> anybody

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
service to the idea but hardly anybody

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.730 
service to the idea but hardly anybody
does<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.110> think<00:01:30.350> there<00:01:30.470> are<00:01:30.500> two

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
does it and I think there are two

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.700 
does it and I think there are two
reasons<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:32.750> really<00:01:33.200> not

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
reasons for that one is it's really not

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.630 
reasons for that one is it's really not
easy<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.540> other<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.860> our<00:01:37.100> basic

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
easy and the other is that our basic

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.050 
easy and the other is that our basic
tenets<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.240> riding<00:01:38.780> also<00:01:39.500> say<00:01:39.890> lower<00:01:40.729> leg<00:01:40.940> on

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
tenets of riding also say lower leg on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.719 
tenets of riding also say lower leg on
the<00:01:41.179> girth<00:01:41.360> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.940 

if<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.719> lower<00:01:45.899> leg<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> gas<00:01:46.530> you're

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
if you go lower leg on the gas you're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.789 
if you go lower leg on the gas you're
likely<00:01:47.219> to<00:01:47.729> stick<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.329> foot<00:01:48.539> forward<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.680> do

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
likely to stick your foot forward to do

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.560 
likely to stick your foot forward to do
it<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:51.030> course<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> other<00:01:51.509> thing

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it and of course the other thing

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.260 
it and of course the other thing
everybody<00:01:52.289> knows<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.770> heels<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.700> if

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
everybody knows if heels down and if

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.760 
everybody knows if heels down and if
you're<00:01:54.420> determined<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.079> your<00:01:55.259> heels<00:01:55.500> down

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
questions I ask myself is if we took the

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.550 
questions I ask myself is if we took the
rider<00:03:33.489> or<00:03:33.849> sorry<00:03:34.090> if<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.299> took<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.569> horse<00:03:34.810> out

rider or sorry if we took the horse out

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.250 
rider or sorry if we took the horse out
from<00:03:35.920> underneath<00:03:36.219> the<00:03:36.519> rider<00:03:36.730> by<00:03:37.060> magic<00:03:37.510> how

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
from underneath the rider by magic how

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.410 
from underneath the rider by magic how
would<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.680> rider<00:03:38.890> land<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.939> riding<00:03:40.269> arena

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
and when you look at ever here I think

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.330 
and when you look at ever here I think
it's<00:03:43.959> quite<00:03:44.140> clear<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.560> if<00:03:44.799> we<00:03:44.950> took<00:03:45.159> the

it's quite clear that if we took the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
it's quite clear that if we took the
horse<00:03:45.549> out<00:03:45.700> from<00:03:45.909> underneath<00:03:46.209> her<00:03:46.540> she<00:03:46.989> would

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
horse out from underneath her she would

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.039 
horse out from underneath her she would
plop<00:03:47.530> down<00:03:47.829> on<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.189> riding<00:03:48.549> arena<00:03:48.819> on<00:03:49.180> her

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
plop down on the riding arena on her

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.910 
plop down on the riding arena on her
feet<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:50.819> would<00:03:51.819> land<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.629> a<00:03:53.230> martial<00:03:53.620> arts

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.160 
feet and would land in a martial arts
position<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:55.739> as<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.920> look<00:03:57.099> at<00:03:57.250> her<00:03:57.459> as<00:03:57.700> well

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.050 
position and as you look at her as well
you<00:03:59.170> can<00:03:59.439> see<00:03:59.739> that<00:04:00.129> if<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.549> look<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:00.849> her

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.559 
you can see that if you look at her
torso<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.950> length<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.430> her<00:04:03.579> front<00:04:03.909> kind<00:04:04.329> of
