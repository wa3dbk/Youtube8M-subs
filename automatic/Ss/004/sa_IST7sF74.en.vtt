00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello friends with you brotishka and 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.620
 Today I am recording a tutorial on how to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.150
 install forge already on pirate 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 minecraft version 1 62 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.400
 for this we need the pirate himself 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.220
 launcher called mc windows 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 launcher or minecraft sailed away essay we 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.990
 download it and run after launch 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 he offers us to choose a directory 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.039
 installation that is where we will have 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 This mine has been installed 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.570
 i call this folder i'm happy to minecraft 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.040
 why not a pirate mine of blood 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.140
 ok ok now we wait for this 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.840
 here is a green striped bottom 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.010
 quick pass 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.899
 let's because the internet is slow and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.320
 I meanwhile pause and let 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.000
 This here is a little greenback passes and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 so after all this here 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.910
 passed green below we go in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 these profile here we choose game 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 directories which we have then 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 the place where you have a microphone 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.810
 should be uzhos well written so in general 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.689
 by itself further you can choose and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.409
 resolution any absolutely and desirable 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.729
 enable java 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 arguments save and write here your 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.320
 name or your nickname any click at all 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 play 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.250
 there must be another jump now 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.439
 in my opinion after we click play 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.509
 offline 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.729
 here yes one more jump begins 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.650
 some files you can too 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.850
 wait while i pause for now 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.960
 and so everything is downloaded, everything is ready 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.509
 run once the world needs to run 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 it is generally desirable because 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.799
 dismiss but minekravt need to run 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.450
 preferably once and for the time being no more 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.579
 so everything is okay threw us off 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.240
 because this is a pirate 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.869
 so well save and exit 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.619
 next we need to download forge 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.599
 site file minekravt forge. no i 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.160
 I think it has already downloaded 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.739
 let's see yes here we run it choose 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.390
 install client and here we choose our 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.220
 the folder where you installed the pirate 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.430
 maynkravt namely I installed mine 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.650
 documents pirate mincraft 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.269
 open and click ok now you can 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.050
 will have to swing some 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.730
 someone’s library they can quickly 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.000
 can download someone slowly 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.620
 download but 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.739
 I will download them slowly 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.799
 Well, I think I'll wait a little 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.080
 and so after he is us all 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.260
 installed and showed such an inscription of the type 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.860
 social full everything is established we run 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.500
 again 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.750
 maynkravt open launcher and now we have 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.319
 a new profile appears with the name 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.019
 forge 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.540
 we select it and click edit pro 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.400
 choose game directories any 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.860
 resolution whatever you want here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.040
 leave released 162 forge your 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:16.030
 versions and include his arguments and here 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.989
 already writing your nickname press play push 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.410
 play offline 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.569
 and now the most should begin 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.239
 long jump for me because i have 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.799
 very very slow internet and he 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.819
 downloads all these files 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:34.650
 very very long you are quite now he 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.650
 downloads libraries 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.639
 Download more so I do not see 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.560
 little green began in general need 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.419
 just wait for the greenback 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.000
 here she appeared here this line for now 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.450
 they will all pass but for the time being I will put 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.980
 to pause and so after we have it 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.139
 that's all done 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.109
 everything seems to be fine with us 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.049
 I have already run two clients 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.590
 at the same time well then this is all for my 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.819
 fault because i did in general 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:14.829
 look we go in the world now quickly 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.799

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.510

 mods let's try to put 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.070
 shader example why not 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:02.139
 we copy own shader and we insert 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.820
 shaders we copy shader pack of problems it 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.680
 here 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.220
 we launch minekravtov profiles forge precisely 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.919
 pirate maykravt now he should 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:21.400
 make it all much faster if i 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:24.490
 not mistaken or not well or yes I don't know 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.919
 in general, let's wait and see 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.919
 how fast does it all work for me 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.340
 Oh yeah 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.759
 schoolchildren still outside the window and it doesn’t matter 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.759
 school children they thing 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.680
 I understand he will be all 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.750
 long do so let me put 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.490
 pause and and 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.490
 and all there-ta-da-dam ha ha ha 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:07.219
 it has been a very long time believe at 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.710
 at least for me, I'm showing that shaders 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:13.639
 set 7 inheritance that minecraft 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.009
 on the pirate and run and they are not because 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.259
 that we didn't turn them on 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.699
 turn on shaders for example the coolest 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.360
 ultra shakers 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.219
 here they are like I was not now 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.710
 lag because shader updated I 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.979
 so the new version has downloaded weed moving 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.860
 foliage moves soapy kintso against 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:37.400
 there is yes here we can you city soap 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.639
 will and where will not we can jump into 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.090
 the water that we look so good but 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.430
 so these seams make me very pissed off and what 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:50.300
 if I turn on 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:54.379

 SAUS as they are exactly called souls 08 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:05.199
 the most normal where nothing moves 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:09.620
 there is such soapy in swivel pinto 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:11.360
