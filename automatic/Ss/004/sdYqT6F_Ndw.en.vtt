00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 what a black wave and then I just bring you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 news about the blog launcher guys 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 much harder in your time night photos 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 that the launcher blog has not been released 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.049
 to start putting what is textures 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 because as the developer said 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 you still can not put much in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 actually see the little red dot of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 up is because the blog fight is in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.470
 safe mode and you can not put it normal 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510
 to grip and motorcycles accessories 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 so actually also not even 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.390
 works for textures or anything 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.960
 you are welcome 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.460
 so good to answer your question 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.930
 those with many months because it does not work 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.030
 the blog launcher because many do that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.590
 Always ask the blog launcher 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.510
 provided that the minecraft is updated 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.000
 has to update is a law of a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.860
 eggs and more now that bring new 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.270
 things will cost a little more than 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 work but since I think they are going to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.480
 arrive 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
 and then it's all in versions of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.630
 google and in the versions of williams 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.420
 craft, all they do is take out 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.890
 some tests of the blog launcher in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.850
 free version that I will leave you link in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.040
 the description so they can 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.560
 download it and that is the only thing 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.730
 do or just do not happen anything else is 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.830
 for those who wonder what I can 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.880
 stop it the previous one tried to put 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.869
 texture puts me say let's see 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.869
 he puts it here 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.890
 we can put one in this case I can 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.040
 put the go to the download folder 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.650
 designates bad is 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.990
 what folder lost here and that's why the 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.660
 directive the south is Celtic that is the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.940
 previous texture let me activate it let's go 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.890
 to continue can only be in mode 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.630
 in this mode you can activate and everything 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.100
 But if I tried to open a world, 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.200
 close the blog what you can 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.240
 try to see if it works well or not 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.270
 me in this case I closed the launcher 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.350
 and it does not let me do anything else so 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.330
 Well, it's practically unusable 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.790
 we would have to wait for a version 2 of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.950
 the beta of the bloc launcher now for 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.710
 be able to run the man craft at least 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.440
 the textures in this case is bird the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.270
 skin are already without blog launcher so now 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.950
 will not see but the option is who in 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.260
 violoncello they are going to remove they were going to leave 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.460
 just motorcycle and so there is only 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.570
 so nobody says goodbye I think I'm 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 but see you in the next video 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.679
 until next time 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.480
 you have to wait for test 2 of the blog 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.750
 launcher too so see you 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.750
 bye
