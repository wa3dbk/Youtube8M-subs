00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
finishes so the left forward is going to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.120 
finishes so the left forward is going to
be<00:03:20.370> reburied<00:03:20.850> little<00:03:21.720> at<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.440> right<00:03:22.650> forward

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130

is going to be Robin and then obviously

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
going to be silver now we did start off

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.060 
going to be silver now we did start off
with<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.220> guy<00:03:35.519> malapa<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.720> then<00:03:37.590> after<00:03:37.890> two

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
with this guy malapa and then after two

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.990 
with this guy malapa and then after two
games<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.610> did<00:03:38.790> switch<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.330> up<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:40.610> two<00:03:41.610> pookie

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
games we did switch you up to two pookie

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.759 
games we did switch you up to two pookie
because<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:42.360> didn't<00:03:42.540> really<00:03:42.660> enjoy<00:03:42.870> malapa

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
because we didn't really enjoy malapa

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.320 
because we didn't really enjoy malapa
because<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.430> formation<00:03:44.820> we<00:03:45.209> were

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
because with this formation we were

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.789 
because with this formation we were
gonna<00:03:45.690> look<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.140> crossing<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
gonna look for the crossing and

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.490 
gonna look for the crossing and
obviously<00:03:47.280> use<00:03:47.459> my<00:03:47.610> lapper<00:03:47.790> as<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.030> target

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
obviously use my lapper as a target

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.630 
obviously use my lapper as a target
target<00:03:49.500> player<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.860> drop<00:03:50.100> his<00:03:50.220> head<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.489> but

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
target player to drop his head in but

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.670 
target player to drop his head in but
didn't<00:03:50.940> really<00:03:51.030> suit<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.570> style<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.019> play<00:03:52.200> so

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
didn't really suit that style of play so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
didn't really suit that style of play so
we<00:03:52.739> thought<00:03:52.769> fuck<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.220> let's<00:03:53.400> mix<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.700> up<00:03:53.790> and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
we thought fuck it let's mix it up and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.759 
we thought fuck it let's mix it up and
put<00:03:54.090> pookie<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.600> there<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.350> space<00:03:55.650> at

of<00:04:32.390> him<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:33.050> main<00:04:33.260> highlights<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.800> little<00:04:33.980> did

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
of him the main highlights a little did

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.440

come<00:04:34.340> from<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.610> free<00:04:34.790> kicks<00:04:35.060> there<00:04:35.270> with

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
come from the free kicks there with

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.120 
come from the free kicks there with
river<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.990> didn't<00:04:36.560> realize<00:04:36.590> how<00:04:36.860> good<00:04:37.010> he<00:04:37.100> was

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
river I didn't realize how good he was

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.530 
river I didn't realize how good he was
at<00:04:37.310> free<00:04:37.460> kicks<00:04:37.670> till<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:37.850> put<00:04:38.000> him<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.270> ball

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
at free kicks till I put him on the ball

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.970 
at free kicks till I put him on the ball
and<00:04:38.780> he<00:04:39.170> sunk<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:39.770> sweet<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.810> massive

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
and he sunk some sweet and massive

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.560 
and he sunk some sweet and massive
disadvantage<00:04:42.980> though<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.730> when<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.300> add

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
disadvantage though is when you add

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.940 
disadvantage though is when you add
counterattacking<00:04:45.200> with<00:04:45.410> a<00:04:45.440> lot<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.770> people

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
counterattacking with a lot of people

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.060 
counterattacking with a lot of people
you<00:04:46.730> any<00:04:47.480> got<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.870> word<00:04:48.050> way<00:04:48.260> it's<00:04:48.380> wrong<00:04:48.650> with

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
you any got the word way it's wrong with

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.100 
you any got the word way it's wrong with
the<00:04:49.490> midfielder's<00:04:50.090> then<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.450> can<00:04:50.630> cost<00:04:50.900> you

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the midfielder's then it can cost you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.710 
the midfielder's then it can cost you
big<00:04:51.710> style<00:04:52.010> especially<00:04:52.430> with<00:04:52.940> my<00:04:53.330> defense

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
big style especially with my defense

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.410 
big style especially with my defense
being<00:04:53.990> quite<00:04:54.200> weak<00:04:54.470> compared<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.160> two<00:04:55.880> usual

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
being quite weak compared to two usual

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.940 
being quite weak compared to two usual
so<00:04:57.790> yeah<00:04:58.790> if<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.330> are<00:04:59.450> going<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.830> choose<00:05:00.830> this

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
so yeah if you are going to choose this

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.250 
so yeah if you are going to choose this
formation<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.610> play<00:05:01.790> with<00:05:02.030> any<00:05:02.300> point<00:05:02.690> make

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
sure you are going to pick really

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.540 
sure you are going to pick really
overpowered<00:05:05.780> center<00:05:06.470> backs<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.920> fast<00:05:07.310> ones
