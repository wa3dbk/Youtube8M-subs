00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
be found on virtually every machine my

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.710 
be found on virtually every machine my
machine<00:02:48.200> is<00:02:48.890> more<00:02:49.700> than<00:02:49.880> 15<00:02:50.269> years<00:02:50.480> old

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
machine is more than 15 years old

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.570 
machine is more than 15 years old
actually<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.739> 20<00:02:52.010> years<00:02:52.040> old<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
actually I think it's 20 years old and

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.120 
actually I think it's 20 years old and
it<00:02:53.569> has<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> stitch<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.709> basic

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
it has the stitch on it and it's a basic

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610 
it has the stitch on it and it's a basic
manual<00:02:55.459> machine<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.269> trust<00:02:57.170> me<00:02:57.230> if<00:02:57.380> it's<00:02:57.500> not

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
manual machine so trust me if it's not

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.009 
manual machine so trust me if it's not
my<00:02:57.769> machine<00:02:58.100> odds<00:02:58.549> are<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.690> machine

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
my machine odds are it's on your machine

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.320 
my machine odds are it's on your machine

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
pin this down so it's right there in the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.250 
pin this down so it's right there in the
center<00:03:19.030> unless<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.480> pins<00:03:20.720> going<00:03:21.080> this

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
center unless I have the pins going this

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.310 
center unless I have the pins going this
way<00:03:21.440> usually<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:22.010> pin<00:03:22.989> I'm<00:03:23.989> going

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
way usually we pin I'm going

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.470 
way usually we pin I'm going
perpendicular<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.640> actually<00:03:25.880> is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
perpendicular but this actually is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.840 
perpendicular but this actually is
better<00:03:26.959> when<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.530> comes<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.859> make<00:03:28.040> minke<00:03:28.670> or

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
better when it comes to make minke or

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.300 
better when it comes to make minke or
cuddle<00:03:29.329> fabric<00:03:29.720> too<00:03:29.989> he's<00:03:30.680> depending<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.160> this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
cuddle fabric too he's depending it this

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.500 
cuddle fabric too he's depending it this
way<00:03:31.430> because<00:03:31.609> it<00:03:31.850> makes<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.209> little<00:03:32.299> more

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
way because it makes it a little more

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.740 
way because it makes it a little more
stable<00:03:32.630> now<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> all<00:03:35.060> down<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
stable now that we have it all down the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.720 
stable now that we have it all down the
great<00:03:35.959> part<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.290> about<00:03:36.829> this<00:03:36.980> fabric<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.549> that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
great part is about this fabric is that

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.360 
great part is about this fabric is that
it<00:03:37.880> doesn't<00:03:38.239> unravel<00:03:38.359> on<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> edges<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.470> all

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
it doesn't unravel on the edges so all

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.069 
it doesn't unravel on the edges so all
we<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.760> do<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.090> just<00:03:41.329> sew<00:03:41.570> along<00:03:41.870> that

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
we have to do is just sew along that

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.680 
we have to do is just sew along that
edge<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.549> will<00:03:43.579> be<00:03:43.820> set<00:03:44.060> so<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.570> don't

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
edge and it will be set so you don't

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.599 
edge and it will be set so you don't
have<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.840> worry<00:03:44.959> about<00:03:45.140> turning<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.160> under<00:03:46.430> or

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
have to worry about turning it under or

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.670 
have to worry about turning it under or
pressing<00:03:46.820> it<00:03:47.030> under<00:03:47.269> because<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:48.019> good<00:03:48.560> to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
pressing it under because it is good to

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.289 
pressing it under because it is good to
go<00:03:48.829> as<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.780> now<00:03:50.780> I'm<00:03:50.959> using<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.380> walking<00:03:51.769> foot

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
go as it is now I'm using a walking foot

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.420 
go as it is now I'm using a walking foot
the<00:03:53.299> walking<00:03:53.720> foot<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.290> very<00:03:55.010> important<00:03:55.340> when

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
the walking foot is very important when

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.430 
the walking foot is very important when
you're<00:03:55.519> sewing<00:03:55.730> through<00:03:56.000> thick<00:03:56.840> sections<00:03:57.290> of

under<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.420> walking<00:04:08.780> foot<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.230> have<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:10.250> set<00:04:10.489> to

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
under the walking foot I have it set to

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.960 
under the walking foot I have it set to
a<00:04:10.730> wider<00:04:11.510> stitch<00:04:12.019> so<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.370> about<00:04:13.519> item

a wider stitch so I have it about item

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.240 
a wider stitch so I have it about item
four<00:04:14.239> on<00:04:14.420> my<00:04:14.540> machine<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.200> you're<00:04:16.100> going<00:04:16.220> to

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
four on my machine and you're going to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.949 
four on my machine and you're going to
make<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> stitch<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.880> little<00:04:17.150> longer<00:04:17.419> as<00:04:17.750> well

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
make the stitch a little longer as well

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.750 
make the stitch a little longer as well
and<00:04:18.229> loosen<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.680> tension<00:04:19.160> just<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.489> little

and loosen up the tension just a little

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.580 
and loosen up the tension just a little
bit<00:04:19.910> because<00:04:20.150> you're<00:04:20.479> dealing<00:04:20.600> with<00:04:20.780> thick

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
bit because you're dealing with thick

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.230 
bit because you're dealing with thick
layers<00:04:21.829> of<00:04:21.919> fabric<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.550> it's<00:04:22.789> just<00:04:23.030> good

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
layers of fabric and it's just good

using a stretch needle a number 90

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.129 
using a stretch needle a number 90
stretch<00:04:28.700> needle<00:04:29.110> as<00:04:30.110> its<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.740> best<00:04:30.860> thing

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
stretch needle as its the best thing

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.809

sky's the limit I like them a little

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:39.820 
sky's the limit I like them a little
more<00:05:38.660> on<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:38.810> plain<00:05:39.020> side<00:05:39.229> because<00:05:39.530> they<00:05:39.680> get

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
more on the plain side because they get

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.960 
more on the plain side because they get
washed<00:05:40.069> so<00:05:40.789> much<00:05:42.430> these<00:05:43.430> type<00:05:43.639> of<00:05:43.669> burp
