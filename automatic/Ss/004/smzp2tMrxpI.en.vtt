00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
was natural to me and I got on the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.660 
was natural to me and I got on the
pavement<00:00:56.220> on<00:00:56.280> my<00:00:56.370> supermoto<00:00:56.850> bike<00:00:57.380> and<00:00:58.380> just

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
felt the consistency of the pavement and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.370 
felt the consistency of the pavement and
just<00:01:01.530> loved<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.400> was<00:01:03.170> like<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.260> could

the<00:01:34.080> track<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.440> get<00:01:34.590> super<00:01:35.010> sideways<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the track to get super sideways but I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.150 
the track to get super sideways but I
don't<00:01:36.570> recommend<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.320> everybody<00:01:37.680> goes<00:01:37.980> out

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
don't recommend that everybody goes out

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.240 
don't recommend that everybody goes out
and<00:01:38.250> tries<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.940> but<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:42.680> plan<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.860> trying

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and tries to do it but I plan on trying

and tries to do it but I plan on trying
to<00:01:44.400> teach<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.910> these<00:01:45.000> guys<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> sport

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to teach some of these guys on the sport

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.380 
to teach some of these guys on the sport
bikes<00:01:46.380> too<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.550> on<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> super<00:01:48.060> Moto's<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
bikes too to get on the super Moto's and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.250 
bikes too to get on the super Moto's and
try<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.810> out

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
try it out

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.040 
try it out
but<00:01:49.740> basically<00:01:50.190> what<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.400> do<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:51.240> back<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.660> in<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
but basically what I do to back it in is

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.890 
but basically what I do to back it in is
it's<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.500> number<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.800> things<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.900> engine

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
it's a number of things it's engine

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you know lean angle entry speed so you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.950 
you know lean angle entry speed so you
know<00:02:02.220> for<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.760> set<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.420> carry<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.750> lot<00:02:03.930> of

speed coming up into the corner and when

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.270 
speed coming up into the corner and when
I<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.660> my<00:02:06.960> brake<00:02:07.229> marker<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> pull<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I go to my brake marker I pull on the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.980 
I bang my down just really click quick
and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> start<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.240> release<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> clutch

and then I start to release the clutch
and<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.920> hit<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> rear<00:02:14.400> brake<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.240> front

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and I hit the rear brake and the front

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.020 
and I hit the rear brake and the front
brake<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.250> front<00:02:17.490> brake<00:02:17.640> helps<00:02:17.790> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
brake and I the front brake helps it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.120 
brake and I the front brake helps it
load<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.390> front<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.930> kind<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.500> step<00:02:19.739> out<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
load the front and kind of step out the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.420 
load the front and kind of step out the
back<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.290> once<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.769> consistent

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
back and once I get that consistent

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.640 
back and once I get that consistent
slide<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.660> engine<00:02:24.989> braking<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.410> right

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
slide and the engine braking is right

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.920 
slide and the engine braking is right
you<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:26.010> you're<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.489> gear

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you know you're the right gear

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
you know you're the right gear
I<00:02:27.989> just<00:02:28.530> modulate<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> front<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
I just modulate it with the front and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.160 
I just modulate it with the front and
front<00:02:30.209> brake<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:30.870> brake
