face<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.990> clay<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> did<00:00:23.519> try<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
face out of clay now I did try that and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029 
face out of clay now I did try that and
it<00:00:24.420> didn't<00:00:24.689> work<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.109> thought<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.769> almost

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it didn't work I thought it was almost

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
it didn't work I thought it was almost
just<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.519> those<00:00:26.640> things<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.570> know

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660

just one of those things that you know
you<00:00:27.750> can't<00:00:28.080> rebirth<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:29.010> making<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you can't rebirth it because making a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
you can't rebirth it because making a
creeper<00:00:30.330> face<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> clay<00:00:31.230> who<00:00:31.949> would<00:00:32.099> think

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
creeper face out of clay who would think

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.700 
creeper face out of clay who would think
that<00:00:32.369> would<00:00:32.790> work<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.989> does<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.350> work<00:00:34.410> in

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that would work so it does not work in

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.830 
that would work so it does not work in
creative<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> need<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
build a creeper face here so you make

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.670 
build a creeper face here so you make
four<00:01:13.920> blocks<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.939> blocks<00:01:15.270> separate<00:01:15.780> well

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
then you want to build the nose here so

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080 
then you want to build the nose here so
two<00:01:21.840> blocks<00:01:22.110> down<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.950> three<00:01:23.400> under<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

two blocks down then three under and
three<00:01:24.600> again<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.159> one

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
three again and then you just do one

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.569 
three again and then you just do one
more<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.420> each<00:01:27.750> side<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> mouth<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> once
