00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:16.260
 already tired here and play need to rest 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 back tired of playing the same thing 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.949
 someone speaks my inner voice damn 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.230
 well, so what else can i play 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.390
 set you war thunder label on 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.840
 desktop 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.840
 Well, yes, I heard about this game and did not play 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.630
 so well then let's go pozyr 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.329
 what are you watching you knew that the main 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 plus this game is realistic because 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.879
 there is no other tank game 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.549
 such that planes and tanks on one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.680
 the map is real, but if you want 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.629
 get some super gift 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.519
 then it is necessary to download the game for that link 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 what is in the description 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.740
 let's go on the jump set and look 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:13.530
 fashion review 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.530
 [music] 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.520
 Hello my tune now we 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.400
 regular fashion review and today I will 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.860
 review not one but two whole mods 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.830
 the truth is not that big 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.570
 Well let's see if you caught fire 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.440
 a bunch of fire extinguisher to help you really 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.240
 you look look mod adding 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 a clear fire extinguisher that puts out 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 quite a huge scale because 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.950
 look we set fire to this bunch of trees 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.010
 and with just a couple of clicks you can 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.520
 extinguish the whole area clearly I think that 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.350
 clearly smoked it is not so difficult 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 see two buckets of water iron bar 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.170
 and red dust and but unfortunately to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.440
 Sorry, he has enough of him 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 just for once 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.810
 huge minus but you know it's pretty 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.700
 fair because Ñ‘-mine because 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.970
 he puts out a huge territory 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.650
 in my opinion so if in principle 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.850
 To craft them a lot, you can basically 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.670
 put out the whole forest 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.519
 Here are both pros and cons of this 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.070
 bunch of from the teacher because look 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.440
 let's say your fire might have a bunch of stew 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.480
 or deal with his hot pukan to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 Sorry, here is such one of the minuses 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.780
 have this 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.980
 fire extinguisher although it would be clear if 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.310
 for example he put out 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.989
 mobs because it would be more like 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.810
 truthfully because see you 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.540
 fired up for example resident and export loses 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.870
 already put out and not put out and in 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.660
 the result 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.970
 but there is a huge plus in this bunch of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.050
 tea teachers and I 'll show you see 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.590
 there are such situations but we take a bunch 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.450
 extinguish 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.000
 and just swoops removes all the lava here 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.850
 I really like it in him because 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.960
 what get down to the cave minute 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.680
 lava and just one click this lava 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.690
 clean 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.740
 here for example about the cave cave you 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.200
 stumble on lava and what we do finally 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.600
 on spoke we remove it and here it is here 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.270
 the words were located and now let's say more 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.920
 one hear and just stew impossible under 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.240
 she can even find what 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.690
 interesting resources 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.780
 like diamond real next look 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.270
 just just in 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.760
 here it is here this monster here it is farts 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.130
 extinguish il well then let it stew or 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.900
 we figured out the next mod we do not 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.950
 less interesting check it out 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.110
 pharmacies this is such a walking chest 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.170
 which you basically doing nothing 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.680
 look and you can just beat it 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.590
 down down runs away from you of course but 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.250
 dunk it you get some random 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.000
 thing is like 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.970
 know this as a lacquer block only alive 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.200
 diamond soul we are on this tutorial clearly here 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.570
 for example a gold bar 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 and so here you can, in principle, look for them 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.239
 he wore oil here of course small 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.220
 probably random about cake on here of course 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.440
 Random not as in lacquer blocks most likely 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.020
 but you can still knock him out 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.020
 cool clear thing here are 4 iron bars 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.000
 but you can find it basically walking everywhere 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.240
 the world know it will be useful on 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.040
 first only phases of development and i think 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.140
 that it is clearly worthy 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.540
 it would still be cooler of course if you can 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.330
 it would be crafted but somehow it is not the same 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.000
 it would be sharp even two diamonds fell out of 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.280
 him here is this topic about bud to greenwich 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.530
 publish them to kill well for both 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.260
 mod, I rate 5 here 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.300
 really fair fashion they 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.240
 attracted by such simplicity 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.720
 write what grade you put a vladus 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.070
 and put it on like that for a long time 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.510
 Th relocate you sorry if you which Che 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.580
 put 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.900
 good and you were meeting him and 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:25.610
 everything 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:25.610
