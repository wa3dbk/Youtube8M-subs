00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.790
 Hello bird of players of world of tanks blitz 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.350

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.350
 I would like to play with m 4 shaman this time as well as last time 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 Recent battles 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.770
 To many people the way is an excellent look 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:30.859
 I am the impression that out Toka is doing the Chochoi Tsu even without active I like that 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.730
 I think that it will be fun if a battle that makes a close battle arose 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.730
 In Let's say 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.140
 It is one of the recently added map in us such and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 Top tear 7 players 1 Teana 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.240
 And recording 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.570
 Here the other party is 24 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.570
 is not it 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:12.399
 Unexpectedly to this 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:12.399
 That there is a difference in matching I think that this is rags lose but in reverse 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 I do not know whether that side is considered 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 For example, in this case, the other party has two tr many 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 It is surprisingly often win with or did not live in the development 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 It's a little bit far too everyone got too many votes 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.350
 I have stopped 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.340
 Follow 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.330
 Because there is a group going from behind 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 If only I can do it 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.600
 At my loading platform 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:02.189
 i House brother 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 It would be nice if the other party was going forward while this temple was going ahead 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.370
 Don't let me get stuck 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.370
 I want to go 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.580
 You did a perverted apple Kawayanagi 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.420
 This is because there is an ally nearby, leave it there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.800
 Me 5 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.800
 With the police department Ivan of 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.870
 Training is 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 There are no enemies 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.709
 There 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.780
 Was not there 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.420
 Over there 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.380
 I think it's alright 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.010
 It is in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.730
 This is the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.730
 Security bant 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 It was the explosion 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.730
 t in the village 48 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.210
 Wow, it is also trained from the system part is bad and bad 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.930
 A little 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.930
 What is the way to drink steel fan ? 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.510
 Distance to security fans 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.510
 Keeping it constant 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.160
 It's a little bit tough, I 've been done with English wisdom pepper 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.080
 ば ば ば や ば ば や や 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.850
 t 43 also came 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.770
 Don't water 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.060
 Production number of the city first, and I could go fast 43 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.260
 Wow 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.260
 This is tight is 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.390
 I got wet 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.720
 this 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.870
 I went to the front side- tank 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.710
 Well 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.060
 Untitled 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:18.669
 It was not aggressive but it was a negative feeling 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.669
 I was not able to create the posture of the scissors 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.819
 Well still 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.819
 It is a match of three cars at a time. 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 It is a good match, it feels good 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.770
 What kind of thing is it 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.169
 It looks like only was funny a little something one of my better of communication 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 where 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.580
 Easy Eight's 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.340
 Take a perspective 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.500
 I want to watch over the elections 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:04.430
 The other party is at 3485. 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:09.850
 The remaining few wisdom wisdom p 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.850
 I think that you can usually win if you stay normally 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:22.660
 Because only type v 3 is also scraped considerably 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.660
 I want to keep down before the t 3485 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.240
 Even though there should be three units here, Machidai is 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.100
 This day 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.529
 The 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:42.159
 Training is 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:44.969
 It's low, it's slow, is n't it? 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.969
 At a low level 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.590
 I wonder if I can't move on my inner clothes 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.969
 It is not good 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.980
 This is Naa bad 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.440
 Ahh, at 43 was cleaned up 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.440
 This is big 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.440
 The 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.670
 usb Gambare I'm a student and I have one more time 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.170
 If I put in three Kan 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.170
 I will be able to 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.910
 Communication from a little while ago 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.850
 Not good Communication is not good 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.550
 Good good good good good after the 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.240
 Everyone beat 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.240
 Mora is me 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.720
 Bang bang 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.650
 It is a job 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.400
 The security version is also that 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:54.420
 Very fast firing speed 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.540
 The power itself is not so much in the one who this person is wearing 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.280
 Because 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.320
 Even if you shoot from the front 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.040
 Can fight 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.040
 I think 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.180
 Good 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.009
 as a result 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:17.200
 Good luck to guard with the remaining vehicle Easy Eight 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.500
 I 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.500
 is not it 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.970
 I have not been active at all 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.680
 it can not be helped 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.260
 If you can ideal Ieba 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:39.120
 The vehicle that the temple waited for 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.120
 Attract the other party in the meantime 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:48.309
 Took me 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:49.480
 The side waiting for g came and attracted a ball, and in the meantime, it turned around and became a form of pinching 

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:52.600
 Is positive 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:57.280
 It was feeling that I assumed 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.700
 I was a little bit stuck with me guard 1 I think it would have been better if I worked a little more 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.780
 not 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:06.389
 That point is a reflection point 

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.389
 Thank you again this time around here
