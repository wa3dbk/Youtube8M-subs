00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.430
 Hello friends 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 Let's go to our fourth video lesson 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.619
 This video lesson, let's continue talking. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.410
 of chord formation 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.610
 now with the formation of chords 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.130
 tiny 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.380
 so I 'll pass the rule also to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.560
 the formation of chords and minutes will 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.900
 compare training can already minutes with 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.920
 the minor chord formation 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.559
 Okay then if you have any questions. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.539
 any clarification that you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.770
 I need your comment 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.870
 do not forget to enjoy and share 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 here strong God bless you hug 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.390
 Ok let's talk then about the formation of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 minute chords 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.679
 let's go even an example of a sun and just for 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.910
 recapitulate reminds of the formation of 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:09.270
 chords of down greatest dog and sun of the minor 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:13.320
 sunshine 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.690
 Okay and now let's see our chord 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 any rule of thumb package 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.840
 minutes 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.580
 The rule is nothing but from the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.760
 I tell a tone and email the same as the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.460
 I tell you the smallest problem so I fought 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.310
 it's medium 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:41.400
 and then it 's the point plus a tone and mail 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.380
 so a tone and a half is the formation of my 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.090
 Wake up minute then this is the dowry minute 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.979
 for you to think a little 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.520
 compare a little with the formation of the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.590
 my the court of the lower court of dowry 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 minute the chord minute it is also 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.170
 called less than a minute because 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.910
 because the second note I pressed 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.789
 aquila already of the characteristic of minor 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.640
 so it's smaller because I 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.860
 to decrease from where the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.790
 third grade the fifth grade only learn 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.950
 then I say ml half tone then beyond 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.100
 little rule of a bull and half a tone and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.459
 I can half break my honey 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.860
 smaller cut and footprint and until the note 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:36.000
 the fifth grade is pressed here and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:39.380
 ae half as cheerfully and joined in the middle 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.680
 of the email from my minor note 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.720
 also my third note the fifth 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:54.230
 degree and a half tone greater size of dodi 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.230
 minute sun 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:03.329
 Let's go to our court formation. 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:09.500
 minute in the sun is so part too 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:12.510
 of my tonic sun as a tone and mail 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.840
 but a tone and email 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.769
 it is the sun cut a minute we 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.340
 from the sun greater sun break smaller than 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:28.170
 from my second grade the third grade 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.690
 ok here my third note 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.299
 my fifth grade 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.700
 half tone of the world only 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.280
 then you can use the tone rule and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.590
 half a year and a half or not 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.170
 to compare 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.000
 worse with the smaller and smaller with the admit ok 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.099
 so here's another video 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.090
 lesson on chord training 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.550
 minutes 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.709
 I hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.629
 forget to enjoy and share
