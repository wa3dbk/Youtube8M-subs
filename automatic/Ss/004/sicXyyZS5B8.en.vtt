00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.340 
work out I reckon BG by the way social
behavior<00:02:47.890> graphic<00:02:48.430> but<00:02:48.760> would<00:02:49.329> be<00:02:49.359> wrong<00:02:49.690> so

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
behavior graphic but would be wrong so

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.050 
behavior graphic but would be wrong so
they<00:02:50.470> are<00:02:50.680> both<00:02:50.859> japanese<00:02:51.400> versions<00:02:51.880> I've
