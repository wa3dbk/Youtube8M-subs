00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello people are good my first not even 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:14.910
 package order for e-mail which ones 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:24.050
 Here are the sizes never in this store 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:27.590
 ordered the first time ordered on January 11 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:40.500
 Today the fourth came transition 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:45.200
 for a smartphone to charge that is very 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.200
 such a useful adapter 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.179
 all who 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:01:00.699
 by the way the postings are so soft that even 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:02.710
 such a fate is rarely found that 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:11.110
 I would like to note here was how 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:14.020
 the terminal itself is drawn that we are beaten 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.369
 most here magnet holders like here 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.390
 everything is exactly the same 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:24.190
 because there were a lot 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.959
 a little three four models with different 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.149
 different mounts me this is more 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.490
 liked but a little more expensive 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:35.350
 in the region of 160 rubles to perednidok 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.899
 standing along with the mailing well let's 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 there is a test here is the original charge 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.950
 From the smartphone we plug the adapter 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:02.420
 Smartphone I do not know in all sony devices 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.549
 cradle and or how it is right 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.090
 magnetic 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:13.130
 magnetic terminal line is all well here for 1 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:23.239
 ass 2 his 3 know exactly what it is 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:26.290
 Well , now let's test the Russian 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.290
 near weak 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.459
 so connected but since not yet not 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.459
 sent 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's gone yet 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.330
 rather than hit 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:10.060
 that's all the way here should be neatly 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:13.470
 apply to hit the terminals here 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.180
 In principle all work is kept 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.900
 keeps so normal there is to move everything 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.900
 keeps well 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.010
 to constantly not open this one 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:36.020
 charging plug 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:42.340
 here and especially to him and bought all 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.340
