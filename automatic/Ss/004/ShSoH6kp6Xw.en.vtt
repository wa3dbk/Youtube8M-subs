00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.180
 Hello friends, I am Andrei Nightingales 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.769
 it is known that the female perception of the world 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.660
 quite significantly different from 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.280
 masculine where is the emotional component 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.260
 although present 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.109
 but rather quickly dies under the onslaught 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.910
 rational approach is the choice of the same 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.520
 smartphone for woman first 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.199
 associated with emotions with color and also with 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.899
 so how good is the novelty 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.010
 match with the owner style and on my 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.410
 memory in recent history 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.690
 smartphone construction as female 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.840
 the device as a new highscreen omega prime 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.360
 dug managed to do only samsung them 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.010
 Lefler lineup but if Koreans have it 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.739
 usually pink white or red 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.989
 body some kind of color ornament then in 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.879
 highscreen did much more radical 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.850
 bundled with the machine go 5 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.230
 colorful plastic covers 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.010
 almost completely changing appearance 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.590
 device memory pops another sony 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.779
 ericsson xperia x10 mini released year 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.149
 three back in the set we walked two 

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.310
 removable panels but now highscreen on 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.409
 the market is practically in proud 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.270
 alone in my memory is 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.819
 The first phone that is not completed 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.369
 two not three at once five replaceable 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.990
 lids if you still throw a couple 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.159
 it would have turned out one socket on 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.979
 everyday 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.619
 or but panelek anisim again and among two 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.229
 predictable black and white can be found 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.729
 orange red even blue in general 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.679
 I thought that highscreen is no longer 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.170
 first time trying to surprise us all 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.420
 quantitative indicators then by the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.640
 capacitive battery boost 2 then you 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.619
 now the largest set of interchangeable 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.049
 the panels are interesting what's different 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.469
 sockets not only in color but also in texture 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.549
 so orange red glossy and white 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.859
 blue and black 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.319
 made matte and no 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.539
 soft-touch coverage is not here but if for 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.549
 blue and white is not a problem then 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.890
 black plastic looks like it is quite 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.170
 cheap and on top of that instantly 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.390
 fingerprinted part 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.189
 owner of such a set of black 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 probably remember the last 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.530
 preferring brighter fellows 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.840
 Lada with covers figured out let's 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.239
 now look at the size of the device 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.819
 This is the second factor which in my opinion 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.799
 immediately addressed the female gadget 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.049
 audience with a small framework 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.480
 display up your own diagonal itself 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.160
 display in four and three inches apparatus 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.660
 falls into the half-forgotten segment 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.090
 compact smartphones 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.889
 Moreover 107 grams of weight and thickness 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.739
 less than 8 millimeters downright 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.849
 the perfect combination for anyone to size 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.680
 has the meaning 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.750
 downright nostalgia for times when 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.959
 smartphones have not yet been taken to hide 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.760
 from the sun the screen by the way is quite good with 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.910
 given that the apparatus of the stars from the sky is not 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.340
 960 by 540 pixel resolution is enough 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.470
 for such a diagonal it looks very much 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.299
 By the way, the screen is not covered by the way. 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.519
 plastic and glass and although it is not 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.349
 gorilla voice scratched glass 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.599
 much less 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.220
 especially suspicious and not too neat 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.829
 natures I would suggest anyway 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.419
 take advantage of protective films and by the way 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.340
 despite the fact that from the very beginning I 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:12.109
 addressed the device for women 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.540
 the audience such a device with a black cap 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:17.239
 looks good in male hands 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.739
 I wonder what the color panels on the very 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.019
 not really colored 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.060
 they are made of white plastic and just 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.200
 painted on one side 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.889
 hope that with daily 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560
 operation 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.260
 this cover is not 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.380
 fights but the black panel to the whole 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.450
 made of black plastic even though 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.160
 definitely worth mentioning as positive 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.190
 the fact is that all the panels 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.700
 very well snaps on the case not 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.640
 backlash 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.680
 do not creak another unusual chip 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 omega prime mini is a processor 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.950
 in spite of the fact that on small tubes 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.900
 taken to save 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.480
 here we see a pleasant exception 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.040
 The heart of the gadgets is as much 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.800
 quad qualcomm s4 play 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.680
 running at 1 and 2 gigahertz in 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.180
 paired with adreno 203 graphics and although 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.799
 the performance of such a tandem is not 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.250
 staggering lately 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.269
 the market does not often meet compact 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.819
 quad models in the same 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.799
 samsung galaxy s4 mini with the same 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.290
 the dimensions of the same screen diagonal 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.370
 dual-core processor but the price is in 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.590
 one and a half times higher 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.510
 taking into account here and there permission and 1 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.440
 gigabyte RAM processor 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.690
 shows good 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.790
 performance about 11,000 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.860
 parrots so with most 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.050
 utilitarian tasks apparatus cope on 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.210
 excellent one more controversial point 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.820
 is the battery first it 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.590
 fixed and at least visible pick out 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.660
 from there his screwdriver is extremely not 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.240
 it is recommended secondly it has 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.220
 a small capacity of only 1600 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.039
 milliampere hours so that by today's standards 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.110
 already on the verge of decency of course the screen and 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.000
 CPU is not the most voracious and 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.950
 battery life is pretty strong 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.320
 depends on how you use 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.169
 I think that with an average load 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.900
 he must be missed from morning to night 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.639
 Also worth noting is 2 micro sim cards 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.039
 able to work simultaneously in mode 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.650
 standby as well as an expansion slot for 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.720
 micro sd cards with it 4 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.320
 embedded modest how can this 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.070
 to expand 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.930
 another 64 gigabyte card is nice 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.300
 surprised and the camera she has a resolution of 8 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.130
 megapixels what for the device cost 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.130
 about 7 thousand rubles in itself 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.320
 It would be nice to shoot it normally and although 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.570
 the camera interface is not spoiled by various 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.280
 only functional is offered 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.080
 who put in the google system itself 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.610
 there is autofocus 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.340
 frame recognition system 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.599
 pretty decent macro at all 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.650
 noticed that highscreen 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.270
 releases the device almost on origen 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.040
 Best stock android offering 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.259
 user to do decorations 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.030
 At its discretion and since we 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.160
 started talking about android worth noting 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.050
 that despite the freshness of the model itself 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.729
 the device works for some reason under 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.919
 running android 4 1 2 jellybin and 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:58.220
 prospects for updates at 422 without saying 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.840
 already 44 very foggy also worth 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.729
 note not too high quality 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.550
 I tried the audio path first 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.020
 listen to music with the bundled 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.690
 headphones but the sound was absolutely 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.020
 not tasty and flat with good ears 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.220
 the situation has changed but not drastically 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.639
 It is possible that the installation of third-party players 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.500
 with an equalizer somehow make a difference 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.570
 in all other respects no complaints gps 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.960
 regularly catch satellites a f m with 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.770
 connected headset radios 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.139
 accelerometer proximity sensors 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.690
 illumination and built-in bluetooth 30 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.430
 make use of the device 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.699
 predictable and comfortable by and large 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.490
 account all you expect to get for 7 490 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:40.160
 there is and maybe even more well 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.380
 Well let's summarize so in the black 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.660
 low cost for quad 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.539
 smartphone rich set of 5 interchangeable 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.849
 panels and a rather nice display in 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.250
 minus not the latest version of android 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.130
 not too high quality sound path and 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.659
 not too capacious battery however 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.789
 there is no going back to the top of ours 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.400
 story then most likely when choosing 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:03.849
 a new smartphone for ladies and our pros and 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.440
 cons will be absolutely not important to her and 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.570
 compactness in combination with multi-colored 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.659
 interchangeable panels will be the main 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.110
 factors when choosing a new gadget to 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:14.110
 dating
