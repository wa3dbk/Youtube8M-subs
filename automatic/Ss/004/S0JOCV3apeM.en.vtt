00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
to be thinking is this doesn't look like

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.230 
to be thinking is this doesn't look like
enough<00:01:29.049> batter<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.890> you're<00:01:30.850> right<00:01:31.000> it

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
enough batter and you're right it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.399 
enough batter and you're right it
doesn't<00:01:31.390> look<00:01:31.630> like<00:01:31.659> enough<00:01:31.900> because<00:01:32.290> it

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
doesn't look like enough because it

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.560 
doesn't look like enough because it
looks<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.619> a<00:01:32.710> very<00:01:32.920> small<00:01:33.280> amount<00:01:33.580> but<00:01:33.820> this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
looks like a very small amount but this

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.530 
looks like a very small amount but this
does<00:01:34.900> actually<00:01:35.170> puff<00:01:36.159> up<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.610> spread<00:01:37.360> out

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540

quite<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.900> lot<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.880> panic<00:01:40.860> trust<00:01:41.860> me<00:01:42.070> I

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
quite a lot so don't panic trust me I

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.060 
quite a lot so don't panic trust me I
know<00:01:42.310> what<00:01:42.549> I'm<00:01:42.640> doing<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:44.320> basically

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
know what I'm doing and just basically

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.130
