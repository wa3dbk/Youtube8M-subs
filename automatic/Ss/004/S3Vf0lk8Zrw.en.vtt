of half size a philosophy orders and it

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.260 
of half size a philosophy orders and it
seemed<00:04:26.600> fairly<00:04:26.840> regular<00:04:27.350> i<00:04:27.560> was<00:04:27.979> going<00:04:28.190> round

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
seemed fairly regular i was going round

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.060 
seemed fairly regular i was going round
and<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.360> saw<00:04:29.540> counted<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.139> and<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.470> was<00:04:30.830> sort<00:04:31.040> of

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
and I saw counted up and it was sort of

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.770 
and I saw counted up and it was sort of
literally<00:04:31.430> every<00:04:31.729> sort<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.060> eight<00:04:32.210> bytes<00:04:32.510> or

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
literally every sort of eight bytes or

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.590 
literally every sort of eight bytes or
definitely<00:04:33.139> 408<00:04:33.860> bias<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.729> yeah<00:04:35.150> from

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
definitely 408 bias and yeah from

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.800 
definitely 408 bias and yeah from
computer<00:04:36.410> side<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:37.880> obviously<00:04:38.240> some<00:04:38.510> sort<00:04:38.690> of

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
computer side is obviously some sort of

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.490 
computer side is obviously some sort of
binary<00:04:39.169> code<00:04:40.300> so<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.810> then<00:04:42.050> did<00:04:42.470> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
binary code so then I that then did the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.050 
binary code so then I that then did the
straightforward<00:04:43.190> thing<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.729> converted

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
straightforward thing I just converted

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.940 
straightforward thing I just converted
it<00:04:44.360> into<00:04:44.419> asking<00:04:45.190> which<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.520> standard

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
it into asking which is the standard

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.560 
it into asking which is the standard
computer<00:04:48.950> language<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:50.150> encode<00:04:50.419> the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
computer language that you encode the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.950 
computer language that you encode the
alphabet<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:53.180> of<00:04:53.330> course<00:04:53.360> I<00:04:53.600> then<00:04:53.810> started

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
alphabet in and of course I then started

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.730 
alphabet in and of course I then started
to<00:04:54.320> get<00:04:54.500> words<00:04:54.770> for<00:04:55.550> me<00:04:55.700> for<00:04:56.479> are<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.740> know

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
to get words for me for are you know

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.469 
to get words for me for are you know
getting<00:04:58.130> somewhere<00:04:58.580> here<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.000> I<00:04:59.060> didn't<00:04:59.330> did

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
getting somewhere here so I didn't did

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.020 
getting somewhere here so I didn't did
the<00:04:59.599> whole<00:04:59.750> thing<00:04:59.780> for<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.320> whole<00:05:00.470> lot<00:05:01.030> and
