toothless instruction guide and a lot of

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.319 
toothless instruction guide and a lot of
detail<00:01:34.270> going<00:01:34.539> on<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.170> guy<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:37.119> just

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
detail going on with this guy let's just

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:43.620

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.290 
tail I guess you can do it either way
probably<00:04:41.639> this<00:04:42.210> way<00:04:42.919> and<00:04:43.919> there<00:04:44.280> we<00:04:44.460> go<00:04:44.639> so<00:04:45.150> now

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
probably this way and there we go so now

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.010 
probably this way and there we go so now
we<00:04:45.360> got<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.600> belt<00:04:45.840> toothless<00:04:46.290> right<00:04:47.750> okay<00:04:48.750> here

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
we got a belt toothless right okay here

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.310 
we got a belt toothless right okay here
we<00:04:49.139> go

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
we go

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.530 
we go
building<00:04:49.800> toothless<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.970> looks<00:04:51.180> like<00:04:51.360> the

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
building toothless it looks like the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.540 
building toothless it looks like the
pegs<00:04:51.840> here<00:04:52.290> are<00:04:52.500> used<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.979> connect<00:04:53.400> them

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
pegs here are used to connect them

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.580 
pegs here are used to connect them
together<00:04:53.700> these<00:04:54.150> are<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:54.510> was<00:04:54.960> originally

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
together these are what was originally

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.129 
together these are what was originally
holding<00:04:56.010> these<00:04:56.100> pods<00:04:56.430> together<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.960> you're

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
holding these pods together so you're

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.750 
holding these pods together so you're
just<00:04:58.260> going<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.560> kind<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.830> double<00:04:59.039> use<00:04:59.400> those

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
just going to kind of double use those

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.090 
just going to kind of double use those
features<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.539> they<00:05:01.169> should<00:05:01.410> just<00:05:01.650> slide

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
features and they should just slide

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.540 
features and they should just slide
right<00:05:02.160> in<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:03.030> lock<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:05.010> wasn't<00:05:05.400> too

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
right in and lock and that wasn't too

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.900 
right in and lock and that wasn't too
hard<00:05:05.820> at<00:05:06.000> all<00:05:08.030> this<00:05:09.030> tail<00:05:09.419> pod<00:05:09.720> pack<00:05:09.990> in<00:05:10.910> and

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
I believe that's where the sensor is and

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.520 
I believe that's where the sensor is and
then<00:06:13.150> you<00:06:13.300> kind<00:06:13.570> of<00:06:13.690> link<00:06:13.960> up<00:06:14.110> with<00:06:14.350> your

then you kind of link up with your
tablet<00:06:14.770> on<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.280> back<00:06:15.580> of<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.510> tablet<00:06:16.810> and

tablet on the back of the tablet and

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.080 
tablet on the back of the tablet and
then<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.680> opens<00:06:18.010> up<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.250> feature<00:06:18.490> in<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.850> game

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
then it opens up a feature in the game

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.940
