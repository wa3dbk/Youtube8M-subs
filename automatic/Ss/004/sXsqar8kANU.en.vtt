00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.240
 hello everyone knows but I hope 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.590
 that you're fine today I'm going 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.299
 to make you a post office hall 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.029
 since I went to the goat farm 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.650
 of blurred bag near march in ardeche and 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 producers have their own brand 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.430
 of cosmetics called gully this 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.960
 are local craft products 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.520
 who are not certified organic but who 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.050
 have a good composition and so I 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.579
 brought back some products including a 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.800
 shampoo jvoulais so it's a 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.119
 artisanal mining in ArdÃ¨che and 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.829
 cosmetics are sold in a 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.510
 kind of small cottages shop it's 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.550
 very nice to visit it's a whole 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.210
 small family farm so nothing 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.649
 industrial 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.149
 we could see the few channels 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.710
 are very pretty elsewhere and the month has 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.210
 been very friendly to visit or if that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.339
 you are interested I would put you 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.960
 the full address in the more part 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.489
 information right below and so 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.410
 in this goat there was a lot of 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.539
 cosmetic care bd boom for 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.699
 hands a lot of soap milks for 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.510
 the body and also some shampoos in 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.070
 different formats 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.120
 I took two champions 500 format 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.469
 milliliters it is not even yet 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.149
 labeled because they come on the 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.129
 to go out is a shampoo that is very 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.840
 mild for single use surfactants that there 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.570
 enough propyl betaine cocaine 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 event 5% goat's milk with 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.360
 some oils some perfumes etc 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.850
 but otherwise we are really in a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.740
 very basic composition by the way 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.300
 it's a fairly economical format and for 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.370
 an artisanal product I found myself 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.350
 cheap at all since it costs 12 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.340
 euros for 500 milliliters on the spot and 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.080
 on the site right now and a 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.270
 promotion and you can have the format 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 without his e-mail at 8 euros obviously these 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.030
 last time I tried them and I 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.410
 found it was a very shampoo 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.580
 very sweet as you can see it is 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.590
 quite liquid but still 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.790
 sufficiently gelatinous and with a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.680
 good texture so at the level of 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.910
 the application is not like with the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.170
 shampoo green house willem or there 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.460
 it's a bit too liquid it's a 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.110
 shampoo of very good quality 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.240
 made in a small company 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.280
 French family and again 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.650
 that's really what interests me in 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 the natural organic minds it's not so much the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.800
 organic supermarkets deep soul is there 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 company but it's the little ones 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.850
 artisans and little known brands 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.710
 like this because for me it has 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.670
 a lot more interest and to the used one 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.800
 also sees the difference 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.480
 I also enriched 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.130
 1 the two bodies and a cream for the 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.350
 face a body milk because 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 the composition looks more or less like 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.530
 that of a conditioner and a cream 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 for the face to moisturize my 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.410
 tattoos 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.560
 the texture is almost creamier than 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 them and he looks in very very good it's 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.470
 pleasant to use 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.510
 which does not hurt and the common point 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.250
 to all products this is the 5% of 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.990
 goat's milk and with our purchases the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.790
 lady kindly offered us soaps 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.960
 unfortunately they contain two 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.820
 ingredients that I do not appreciate at 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.380
 to know about palm oil and the reason 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.540
 puzzles and they professional who is a 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.310
 conservative to this hoax hic and not the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.690
 all accepted in organic so it's not 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.250
 a product that would be personally 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.600
 but by cons I have a real shot of 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.100
 heart for the shampoo I will return to 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.550
 the goat house to buy a small one 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.540
 stock 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.830
 you also have to know that it's a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.450
 shampoo that does not put it at all 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.370
 hair when I use it after 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.260
 shampoo and absolutely not necessary 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.730
 and as I'm trying to use already a 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.990
 conditioner one time out of two but 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.830
 there I can do once in three or 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.990
 once in four 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.490
 I really limit the use of 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.170
 the after- shampoo and therefore as 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.670
 you see it the lemon is doing its little 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.620
 effect since it's still going 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.270
 pretty shiny hair they're all 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.310
 you and the shampoo are extremely 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 good it's a pleasure to use it 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.709
 so we can conclude that this is a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.360
 beautiful discovery 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.520
 I will make you a more detailed article 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.940

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.320

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.930
