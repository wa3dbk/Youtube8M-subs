00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
come back to that level that he was

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.939 
come back to that level that he was
playing<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:50.969> before<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.570> say<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> major

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
playing at before you say it's a major

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
playing at before you say it's a major
procedure<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.059> take<00:00:54.270> us<00:00:54.480> through<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
procedure just just take us through it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
procedure just just take us through it
exactly<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.920> will<00:00:56.129> David<00:00:56.460> Haye<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> go

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
exactly what will David Haye have to go

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
exactly what will David Haye have to go
through<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.390> rebuild<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.500> shoulder

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
through to rebuild that right shoulder

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
through to rebuild that right shoulder
if<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> start<00:01:00.059> by<00:01:00.210> saying<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> muscle

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
if I start by saying that the muscle

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
if I start by saying that the muscle
that<00:01:01.800> he<00:01:01.890> tore<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> actually<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.030> muscle<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that he tore is actually a muscle that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.240 
that he tore is actually a muscle that
stabilize<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> shoulder<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.040> were<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
stabilize the shoulder so if you were to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
stabilize the shoulder so if you were to
kind<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> punch<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.540> hard<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> arm<00:01:07.350> got

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
kind of punch very hard and the arm got

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
kind of punch very hard and the arm got
pulled<00:01:07.979> backwards<00:01:08.479> that's<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> muscle<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pulled backwards that's the muscle that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480 
pulled backwards that's the muscle that
stabilize<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> shoulder<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.369> its

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
stabilize the shoulder back into its

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.960 
stabilize the shoulder back into its
socket

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
socket

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020 
socket
and<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.540> gets<00:01:12.780> ripped<00:01:13.049> off<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.850> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and that gets ripped off when that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
and that gets ripped off when that
muscle<00:01:15.240> rips<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> doesn't<00:01:16.290> rip<00:01:16.650> one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
muscle rips off it doesn't rip one

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
muscle rips off it doesn't rip one
muscle<00:01:17.250> off<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> also<00:01:17.670> rips<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> tendon<00:01:18.659> that's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
muscle off it also rips a tendon that's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
muscle off it also rips a tendon that's
the<00:01:18.990> bicep<00:01:19.380> tendon<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.890> big<00:01:20.009> bulky<00:01:20.369> muscle

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the bicep tendon the big bulky muscle

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.630 
the bicep tendon the big bulky muscle
it's<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> tendon<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.049> there<00:01:22.640> when

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it's got a tendon going up there when

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.480 
it's got a tendon going up there when
both<00:01:23.880> these<00:01:24.060> rupture<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.049> them<00:01:25.229> back

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
both these rupture then to put them back

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.179 
both these rupture then to put them back
needs<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.610> significantly<00:01:27.240> large<00:01:27.540> operation<00:01:28.189> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
needs a significantly large operation it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
needs a significantly large operation it
can<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.670> done<00:01:29.790> both<00:01:30.000> ways<00:01:30.210> either<00:01:30.479> either

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
can be done both ways either either

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.179 
can be done both ways either either
through<00:01:31.259> an<00:01:31.350> open<00:01:31.619> procedure<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
through an open procedure that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.530 
through an open procedure that
traditionally<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.119> done<00:01:33.329> or

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
traditionally that it was done or

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.390 
traditionally that it was done or
through<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> keyhole<00:01:34.680> operation<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.310> done

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
through a keyhole operation that's done

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
through a keyhole operation that's done
nowadays<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.479> believe<00:01:36.780> he's<00:01:37.049> had<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
nowadays but I believe he's had it in

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.240 
nowadays but I believe he's had it in
Germany<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.890> had<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.220> done<00:01:38.369> open<00:01:39.979> for<00:01:40.979> any

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Germany and had it done open for any

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.960 
Germany and had it done open for any
tendon<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:42.450> repaired<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.439> healed<00:01:43.970> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
tendon that's repaired and is healed it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.969 
tendon that's repaired and is healed it
takes<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> least<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:46.020> months<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> heal

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
takes at least two months for it to heal

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.719 
takes at least two months for it to heal
well<00:01:47.220> before<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.700> starts<00:01:48.030> being<00:01:48.600> mobilized

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
well before it starts being mobilized

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.980 
well before it starts being mobilized
but<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> mean<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> mean<00:01:51.840> by

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
but I mean what about what I mean by

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.240 
but I mean what about what I mean by
mobilizing<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.649> he<00:01:52.710> starts<00:01:52.979> getting<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
mobilizing that he starts getting the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
mobilizing that he starts getting the
full<00:01:53.430> movement<00:01:53.670> bring<00:01:54.000> sideways<00:01:54.630> forwards

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
full movement bring sideways forwards

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
full movement bring sideways forwards
and<00:01:55.680> backwards<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> once<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.450> gets<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and backwards and once he gets that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
and backwards and once he gets that
movement<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.159> got<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> be

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
movement then it's got to be

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.580 
movement then it's got to be
strengthened<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.180> again<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.320> time

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
strengthened up again and all this time

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.109 
strengthened up again and all this time
while<00:02:01.770> he's<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.070> moving<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> muscle<00:02:02.880> it's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
while he's not moving the muscle it's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
while he's not moving the muscle it's
going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.479> getting<00:02:04.229> weaker<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.829> gonna

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
going to be getting weaker and gonna

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.980 
going to be getting weaker and gonna
take<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.880> long<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> recover<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:06.719> we're

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
take that long to recover now we're

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229 
take that long to recover now we're
running<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> time<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.770> 40<00:02:07.979> he's<00:02:08.220> 33<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
running out of time at 40 he's 33 you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.390 
running out of time at 40 he's 33 you
think<00:02:09.390> there's<00:02:09.539> any<00:02:09.720> chance<00:02:09.810> he<00:02:10.500> should<00:02:10.830> as<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
think there's any chance he should as a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.870 
think there's any chance he should as a
surgeon<00:02:11.879> Fox<00:02:12.120> again

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
surgeon Fox again

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.610 
surgeon Fox again
that's<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.570> difficult<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.080> answer<00:02:14.200> there

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that's a difficult one to answer there

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.770 
that's a difficult one to answer there
have<00:02:14.770> been<00:02:14.890> people<00:02:15.100> who<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.340> gone<00:02:15.520> back<00:02:15.790> into

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
have been people who have gone back into

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.020 
have been people who have gone back into
boxing<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> think<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.430> chances<00:02:18.910> are

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
boxing but I think that the chances are

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.090 
boxing but I think that the chances are
better<00:02:19.360> low<00:02:19.720> okay<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.650> won't<00:02:20.860> say<00:02:21.010> it's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
better low okay I won't say it's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.060 
better low okay I won't say it's
completely<00:02:21.300> no<00:02:22.300> okay<00:02:22.990> alright<00:02:23.590> nobody<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.950> get

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
completely no okay alright nobody to get

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.230 
completely no okay alright nobody to get
