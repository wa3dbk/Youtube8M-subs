00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.839
 hello with you comrade project and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 today we would like to talk about 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.609
 such a creation of our Japanese friends as 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 mahou how and from whom the large holes or 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 the mediocrity of the school of magicians though it 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 anime has no outstanding team 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 creators except famous studio 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.080
 madhouse but the guys coped with their 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 challenge on the excellent plot of this 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 works although not so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 original but enough stood out in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 spring season and the beginning of the story on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.469
 narrates that because of the sharp 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 cold weather people had to fight for 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.460
 energy sources and this led to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.530
 terrible third world war which 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.239
 lasted as many as 20 years on earth 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 only three billion left 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590
 a person might be even less 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 If only not operators of magic which 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.399
 prevented their thermonuclear war 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 significant interference led to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 that the world plunged into the race of development 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 magicians and magic in general she soon 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 completely come into use and now 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 used everywhere from 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.369
 army and ending ordinary eatery 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 my also certainly appeared magical 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.810
 schools that teach how to use magic 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 and develop it our main hero shibata 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 At first glance, the station is not particularly prominent. 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 the magician did with his sister 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.659
 Shiba and Miyuki in the first high school at 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 national university of magic but to 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.650
 Unfortunately, it is determined to the second thread 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
 which among students call 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.280
 weed and sister in the first stream 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 We call and flowers as you could 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.799
 guess the difference can be heard in the very 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 the title 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 If the simple weed and weaknesses 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.159
 strong flowers from which it should immediately 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 discrimination and express it in their 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.090
 pleasure citizens florists but in 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.470
 during the first days of training a lot 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
 falls into place 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 weeds are not so untalented and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.009
 some can quietly shut up 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.350
 belt of the individual of the first stream of course 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.509
 he is not an exception in the garage and equipment 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 the sister can not shine with the mind either 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.380
 miss though and considers taking much 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 stronger and more talented and sometimes 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.340
 it seems that it is his little 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 Do not idolize though miyuki 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.229
 and she is very talented and her strength is very 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.819
 and to face and character in general this couple 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.619
 rather unusual 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.749
 like to put people in a stupor 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.459
 and play them sarcasm because 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.620
 the parties don't always say they are native 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.569
 brother and sister maybe last even 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.760
 I would like this fact but 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 going back to the plot idea then his lead 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.810
 It appears quite quickly because 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.879
 some organization is trying to smash the brain 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.099
 students for 2 streams glowing 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.959
 the atmosphere against discrimination but it 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.180
 only the tip of the iceberg and the main characters 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.370
 very interested in finding 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 the root of all the rebels i mean find out 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.129
 where do legs grow 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.989
 but since this problem is far beyond 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.030
 the framework of his school all of course 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.590
 quite influential people are involved then 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 we are waiting for a very interesting story 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.819
 which includes a lot of great 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.919
 traced walls with battles and at least 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.810
 the work is divided into several arches 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.719
 but they are great in one another 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.609
 like inseparable and parts this anime is one 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.260
 from a small list that tighten 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.540
 immediately and does not let go until the very last 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 a series of heroes and the outcome of the plot 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.469
 It is interesting to observe each of the students 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.060
 Schools has a unique talent 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.340
 they are just the main character as often 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 sometimes truth is incomprehensible and sometimes 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.849
 strange moments but not on them 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 getting stuck too happens too 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.870
 a lot of information that is simple 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.819
 tires seemingly the author tried as 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.859
 you can give us more sense of that world 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.479
 which he created but thanks to the good 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.879
 drawing all these recent 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.879
 perceived not so bitterly magic and 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.019
 the story as a whole looks very appetizing 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.819
 the music is excellent 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.489
 fits because while watching a video 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.530
 don't even notice in general those who love 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.509
 Anime like strike for fornication and all 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.370
 a series of that aru ana especially should 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.169
 like the series like its 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.060
 setting but also those who did not watch them 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.979
 will remain quite satisfied 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.000
 with you was the project wish you 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.000
 pleasant viewing
