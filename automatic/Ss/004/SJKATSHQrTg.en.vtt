00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.640 

now<00:01:43.790> comes<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.180> tricky<00:01:44.450> part<00:01:44.870> we<00:01:45.410> take<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
now comes the tricky part we take the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.980 
now comes the tricky part we take the
white<00:01:45.980> polish<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.670> draw<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> shape<00:01:47.210> like<00:01:47.270> beer

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.960 

then<00:01:57.260> we<00:01:57.530> make<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.740> few<00:01:58.010> stripes<00:01:58.340> for<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.670> tail

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
then we make a few stripes for the tail

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.170 
then we make a few stripes for the tail
like<00:01:59.360> this<00:01:59.620> we<00:02:00.620> also<00:02:00.770> done<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.370> few<00:02:01.640> white<00:02:01.850> spots

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.050 

next<00:02:06.420> step<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.109> most<00:02:07.320> difficult<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:08.060> take

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
next step is the most difficult one take

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
next step is the most difficult one take
the<00:02:09.239> dark<00:02:09.479> gray<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.959> dark<00:02:10.019> brown<00:02:10.530> polish<00:02:10.950> draw
