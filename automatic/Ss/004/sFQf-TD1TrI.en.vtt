the brain I got something to put in your

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
the brain I got something to put in your
end<00:00:47.390> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.520 

and<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.149> easier<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.230> sweep

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
you have so much more freedom with

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.080 
you have so much more freedom with
classic<00:00:59.860> weapons<00:01:00.219> that<00:01:00.460> we've<00:01:00.610> taken<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:01.000> the

couldn't<00:01:04.600> do<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:04.930> previous<00:01:05.320> hard<00:01:05.500> work

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.060 

the<00:01:10.910> Venus<00:01:11.300> human<00:01:11.630> trap<00:01:11.930> which<00:01:12.230> is<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.620> big

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
the Venus human trap which is a big

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.910 
the Venus human trap which is a big
giant<00:01:13.730> green<00:01:14.300> plant<00:01:14.750> with<00:01:14.990> huge<00:01:15.350> tentacles

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
giant green plant with huge tentacles

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.980 
giant green plant with huge tentacles
and<00:01:16.130> it'll<00:01:16.430> pick<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:16.880> cars<00:01:17.180> pick<00:01:17.600> up<00:01:17.780> people

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
and it'll pick up cars pick up people

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.420 
and it'll pick up cars pick up people
and<00:01:18.230> just<00:01:18.530> eat<00:01:18.740> him

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.510 

it's<00:01:22.390> also<00:01:22.570> interactive<00:01:23.260> so<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:23.530> can<00:01:23.800> PK<00:01:24.490> a

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
it's also interactive so you can PK a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.460 
it's also interactive so you can PK a
human<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.180> bring<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.570> near<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> tentacle<00:01:26.290> and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
human and bring it near a tentacle and

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.140 
human and bring it near a tentacle and
the<00:01:26.800> Venus<00:01:27.130> human<00:01:27.340> trap<00:01:27.520> we'll<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.790> grab<00:01:27.940> it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
the Venus human trap we'll just grab it

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.700 
the Venus human trap we'll just grab it
right<00:01:28.480> from<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.590> cool

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
right from and one of the really cool

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.410 
right from and one of the really cool
weapons<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.280> have<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.520> called<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.910> black<00:01:34.120> hole

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
weapons we have is called the black hole

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.030 
weapons we have is called the black hole
gun

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.670 

could<00:01:40.940> not<00:01:41.150> generate<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.960> kind<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.230> physics

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
could not generate that kind of physics

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.390 
could not generate that kind of physics
trauma<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.850> world<00:01:44.150> on<00:01:44.830> old<00:01:45.830> systems<00:01:46.250> but

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
trauma to the world on old systems but

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.350 
trauma to the world on old systems but
now<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:46.640> can

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.050 

you<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.170> fire<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.590> off<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:52.250> huge<00:01:52.760> black

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
you just fire it off in this huge black

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.630 
you just fire it off in this huge black
hole<00:01:53.300> just<00:01:53.570> rips<00:01:53.930> space<00:01:54.590> wide<00:01:55.010> open<00:01:55.490> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
hole just rips space wide open and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.400 
hole just rips space wide open and
everything<00:01:56.240> all<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.480> objects<00:01:56.900> all<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> cars

everything all the objects all the cars
and<00:01:57.620> all<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.800> people<00:01:58.010> just<00:01:58.370> get<00:01:58.520> sucked<00:01:58.910> right

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
and all the people just get sucked right

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
and all the people just get sucked right
into<00:01:59.360> it<00:01:59.630> before<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.230> final<00:02:00.650> blast
