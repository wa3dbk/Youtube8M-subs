immediately that the rails on this board

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.810 
immediately that the rails on this board

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
is how quickly the nose rocker turns

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.880 
is how quickly the nose rocker turns

then<00:04:23.690> that's<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.930> very<00:04:23.960> good<00:04:24.380> sign<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.650> you

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
then that's a very good sign that you

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.960 
then that's a very good sign that you
could<00:04:25.040> have<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.190> lot<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.460> fun<00:04:25.670> on<00:04:25.700> this<00:04:25.910> board

when it comes to fins in this board
you'd<00:04:27.890> likely<00:04:28.340> find<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.970> width<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.330> the
