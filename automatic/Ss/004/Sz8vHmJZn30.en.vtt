00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.430

 a witch and I am damn good at all 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.470

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.060

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.290
 girls lurking magic 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.130

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.130
 to think 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.300

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.680

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.930
 nasty rumors besides everyone knows that I 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.930
 I prefer neither color nor green 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.690

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.370
