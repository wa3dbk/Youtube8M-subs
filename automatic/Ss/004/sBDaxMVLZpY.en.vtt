00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
okay so what we got here is two blowers

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.680 
okay so what we got here is two blowers
two<00:00:05.549> rotors<00:00:06.330> from<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:08.240> 8v<00:00:09.980> 92<00:00:10.980> series<00:00:11.670> either<00:00:12.179> 80

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
two rotors from a 8v 92 series either 80

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.000 
two rotors from a 8v 92 series either 80
92<00:00:13.290> or<00:00:14.540> 8v<00:00:15.590> 71<00:00:16.590> um

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.200 

Detroit<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.340> as<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:23.939> they're

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Detroit and as you can see they're

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070 
Detroit and as you can see they're
pretty<00:00:24.619> scarred<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.800> um<00:00:26.720> they're<00:00:27.720> really

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
pretty scarred up um they're really

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.660 
pretty scarred up um they're really
light<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:29.220> three<00:00:29.699> pounds<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.150> pop<00:00:31.219> but<00:00:34.670> yeah

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
light like three pounds of pop but yeah

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.660 
light like three pounds of pop but yeah
on<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> blower<00:00:37.380> over<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:43.670> here's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
on I have the blower over here here's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.010 
on I have the blower over here here's
the<00:00:44.879> blower<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.620> honestly<00:00:47.100> can't<00:00:47.789> remember

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
the blower and I honestly can't remember

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.970 
the blower and I honestly can't remember
but<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.770> specific<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.940> series<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.020> know

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but this is specific to a series I know

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.180 
but this is specific to a series I know
it's<00:00:53.340> an<00:00:53.489> 8<00:00:53.699> cylinder<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.680> my<00:00:55.680> grandfather

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's an 8 cylinder and my grandfather

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's an 8 cylinder and my grandfather
turned<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> cactus<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:58.500> planner<00:01:01.250> what

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
turned it into a cactus a planner what

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
turned it into a cactus a planner what
happened<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.530> obviously<00:01:04.530> sucked

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
happened was it obviously sucked

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
happened was it obviously sucked
something<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> blower<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
something through the blower because the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.590 
something through the blower because the
rotor<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> showed<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> over<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.360> had

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
rotor that I showed you over there had

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.440 
rotor that I showed you over there had
big<00:01:13.010> Nicks<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.280> gouges<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:17.450> they

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
big Nicks and gouges in it and they

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.929 
big Nicks and gouges in it and they
blower<00:01:18.780> case<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.590> hope<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.460> stabbed

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
blower case I hope I don't get stabbed

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:30.020 
blower case I hope I don't get stabbed
or<00:01:21.180> eaten<00:01:21.540> by<00:01:21.780> spiders<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.340> case<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.909> our

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or eaten by spiders the case this is our

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.540 
or eaten by spiders the case this is our
big<00:01:30.210> barbecue<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> case<00:01:33.990> here

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.690 

has<00:01:38.550> a<00:01:38.580> crack<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:40.590> runs<00:01:40.860> from<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.100> top<00:01:41.220> there

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
has a crack that runs from the top there

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.440 
has a crack that runs from the top there
don't<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.420> could<00:01:42.890> make<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:43.920> out

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
don't know if you could make that out

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.720 
don't know if you could make that out
right<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.950> runs<00:01:46.950> from<00:01:47.190> there<00:01:48.140> here<00:01:49.730> right

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
right there runs from there here right

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.140 
right there runs from there here right
down<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.120> center<00:01:51.510> here<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.730> know<00:01:53.730> if<00:01:53.820> you'll<00:01:53.970> be

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
down the center here I know if you'll be

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.100 
down the center here I know if you'll be
able<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.080> center<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.900> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
able to see right down the center and it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
able to see right down the center and it
stops<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:59.070> over<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.730> at<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.840> hole<00:02:02.090> then

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
stops right over here at this hole then

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.280 
stops right over here at this hole then
there's<00:02:03.330> another<00:02:03.480> crack<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:07.080> obviously

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
there's another crack here so obviously

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.810 
there's another crack here so obviously
something<00:02:10.290> got<00:02:10.470> sucked<00:02:10.860> into<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.280> rotor<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
something got sucked into the rotor and

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.970 
something got sucked into the rotor and
it<00:02:12.090> spread<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.660> house<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.560> housing

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
it spread the house that the housing

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.540 
it spread the house that the housing
apart<00:02:15.350> because<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.440> could<00:02:16.740> see<00:02:17.600> right<00:02:18.600> here

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
apart because you could see right here

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.390 
apart because you could see right here
on<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.610> one<00:02:21.060> rotor<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:22.530> rotor<00:02:25.100> right<00:02:26.100> there

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
on the one rotor this rotor right there

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
on the one rotor this rotor right there
you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.570> see<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:28.490> at<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.290> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you can see there at this this is the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
you can see there at this this is the
side<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.130> actually<00:02:32.700> goes<00:02:33.209> through<00:02:35.630> where

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
side that actually goes through where

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.320 
side that actually goes through where
that<00:02:36.810> piece<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.920> had<00:02:41.330> catastrophic

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
that piece is so it had catastrophic

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.350 
that piece is so it had catastrophic
damage<00:02:42.540> done<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.110> it
