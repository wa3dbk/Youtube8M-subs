00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.030
 behind 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.950
 you have to remove the wheel for this 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.480
 on jalan 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.940
 farther 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.150
 first remove the wheel 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 he could pass 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.210
 hem pro 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 here and then look further 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.630
 situated 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630
 wheels 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.540
 tank 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.170
 all remove the bolts 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.170
 unscrew 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.460
 here so as we took off in the counties 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.540
 we get full access to the entire system 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.860
 washer tank motor, respectively 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.860
 all hoses and wires 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.640
 means pre-putting capacity 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.390
 to drain water 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.159
 we're shooting us so it sticks itself 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.439
 pump 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.740
 here we have removed it was to get the word 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.479
 holes leg poured water . now 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.640
 filmed on her words we can take here 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 this plug that feeds you 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.549
 photo no photo means 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.079
 now when we removed the motor we wash 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.030
 now rented with two fingers 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.869
 press with two fingers right here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.340
 so wait 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.470
 comments are now new 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.209
 even than I do not comment, I am silent 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 so do not be silent is already being recorded 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.650
 it means now when we removed the motor we 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.560
 click on the sides of the lock and remove 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.650
 power lead it is also very easy in 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 principle is done all the wire to remove 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.230
 the motor is shot further after that to us 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 you will need to check the food where it 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.549
 12 volts on a motor and see 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.530
 Does it work in principle, something like us ? 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.849
 one of the hoses removed all the hoses 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.590
 we put pressure on him 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.489
 equivalent to that served 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.180
 onboard network 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.739
 screw up to 12 volts respectively and 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.480
 it turned out that we have a motor almost 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.049
 nothing twists she works barely audible 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.470
 shooting on motor 2 work for arrow 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:53.019
 to me 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.090
 apparently you have to pass me right 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.630
 put a new pump now we will 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 try pouring liquid into the system 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 try how it works 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.269
 everything works motor working good 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.340
 now we collect the whole system in reverse 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.909
 okay, you have topped up with water 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.760
 the tank is not up to full well, then it remains 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:22.670
 collect everything in proper order and everything 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.670
 the work is finished everything is collected everything is fine
