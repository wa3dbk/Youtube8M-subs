00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
welcome back to another video this is

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.400 
welcome back to another video this is
another<00:00:02.730> episode<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:03.270> GT<00:00:03.600> 6<00:00:03.840> projecting

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
another episode of my GT 6 projecting

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.840 
another episode of my GT 6 projecting
series<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.009> decided<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.490> feature<00:00:05.640> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
series and I decided to feature the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.320 
series and I decided to feature the
Toyota<00:00:06.270> Supra<00:00:06.480> SZ<00:00:07.259> or<00:00:07.550> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> naturally

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
Toyota Supra SZ or this is a naturally

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.509 
Toyota Supra SZ or this is a naturally
aspirated<00:00:09.360> Supra<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.800> different<00:00:11.160> to

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
aspirated Supra so it is different to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.230 
aspirated Supra so it is different to
the<00:00:11.639> RZ<00:00:12.269> because<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.080> has<00:00:13.380> less<00:00:13.740> horsepower

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
the RZ because this has less horsepower

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.269 
the RZ because this has less horsepower
also<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.660> has<00:00:15.839> no<00:00:15.990> turbos<00:00:16.350> which<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:17.220> course

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
also it has no turbos which of course

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.880 
also it has no turbos which of course
you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:18.119> tell<00:00:18.660> since<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.140> said<00:00:19.320> as<00:00:19.500> much<00:00:19.529> that's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
you can tell since I said as much that's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
you can tell since I said as much that's
right<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> anyway<00:00:20.550> after<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.850> tuned<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
right it anyway after I tuned it it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.150 
right it anyway after I tuned it it
managed<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.560> not<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> lot<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
managed to look like this not a lot of

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.470 
managed to look like this not a lot of
tuning<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.640> done<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:23.970> since<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
tuning can be done to this since it is a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.849 
tuning can be done to this since it is a
standard<00:00:24.990> car<00:00:25.199> alright<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> change<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
standard car alright to change the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.259 
standard car alright to change the
wheels<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> actually

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
wheels and on this one you can actually

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
wheels and on this one you can actually
remove<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> wing<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.590> cannot<00:00:28.830> do<00:00:29.039> on

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
remove the wing which you cannot do on

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.030 
remove the wing which you cannot do on
the<00:00:29.429> RZ<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> paint<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> titanium

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the RZ also the paint was a titanium

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.580 
the RZ also the paint was a titanium
gray<00:00:32.399> which<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.690> looks<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.230> good<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
gray which I think looks pretty good it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.860 
gray which I think looks pretty good it
sort<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> has<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.190> gold<00:00:35.550> /<00:00:35.910> bronzes<00:00:36.719> like

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
sort of has like a gold / bronzes like

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.799 
sort of has like a gold / bronzes like
shade<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.219> some<00:00:38.340> reason<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.570> think

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
shade on it for some reason but I think

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.119 
shade on it for some reason but I think
that<00:00:39.930> makes<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:40.980> nice

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that makes it look really really nice

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.720 
that makes it look really really nice
but<00:00:41.550> anyway<00:00:42.469> the<00:00:43.469> Superleggera<00:00:43.890> wheels<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
but anyway the Superleggera wheels and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.840 
but anyway the Superleggera wheels and
that's<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:46.980> let's<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.579> into

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that's pretty much it now let's go into

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.010 
that's pretty much it now let's go into
the<00:00:47.940> tuning<00:00:48.120> I'll<00:00:48.360> show<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.539> guys<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> tuning

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the tuning I'll show you guys the tuning

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.510 
the tuning I'll show you guys the tuning
that<00:00:49.140> I've<00:00:49.230> done<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that I've done to this as you can see it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
that I've done to this as you can see it
has<00:00:51.379> 394<00:00:52.379> brake<00:00:52.559> horsepower<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.870> 1188<00:00:54.870> kilos

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
has 394 brake horsepower and 1188 kilos

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.819 
has 394 brake horsepower and 1188 kilos
um<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.750> drift<00:00:58.020> car<00:00:58.079> since<00:00:58.590> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
um not a lot for a drift car since this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.220 
um not a lot for a drift car since this
is<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> said<00:00:59.309> naturally<00:00:59.760> aspirated<00:00:59.969> own<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
is as I said naturally aspirated own so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
is as I said naturally aspirated own so
I<00:01:01.289> can't<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.770> nice<00:01:01.859> Horrible's<00:01:02.190> also<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
I can't have a nice Horrible's also I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
I can't have a nice Horrible's also I
did<00:01:03.180> put<00:01:03.570> only<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> sports

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
did put only that I think the sports

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710 
did put only that I think the sports
exhaust<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> didn't<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.580> any<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:06.479> higher

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
exhaust on I didn't put any any higher

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.880 
exhaust on I didn't put any any higher
exhaust<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.740> sounds

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
exhaust on it just because it sounds

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
exhaust on it just because it sounds
pretty<00:01:08.549> decent<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> sports<00:01:09.659> exhaust<00:01:09.780> on

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pretty decent with the sports exhaust on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.649 
pretty decent with the sports exhaust on
it<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.159> track<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:12.270> drives

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it and on the track it actually drives

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
it and on the track it actually drives
really<00:01:13.170> well<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:13.890> surprised<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> was

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
really well I was very surprised I was

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.370 
really well I was very surprised I was
very<00:01:15.390> surprised<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
very surprised but I was kind of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
very surprised but I was kind of
surprised<00:01:16.710> since<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.119> no<00:01:18.240> turbos

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
surprised since it has like no turbos

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
surprised since it has like no turbos
and<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> hazard<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.290> pretty<00:01:19.530> low<00:01:19.710> horsepower

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and a hazard like pretty low horsepower

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.219 
and a hazard like pretty low horsepower
so<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> thought<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.960> kind

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
so like I thought it was gonna be kind

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.550 
so like I thought it was gonna be kind
of<00:01:22.530> bad<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.670> wasn't<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of bad but it wasn't like you have the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
of bad but it wasn't like you have the
power<00:01:25.830> there<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.600> course<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.930> as

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
power there but it's of course not as

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
power there but it's of course not as
much<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.860> let's<00:01:29.340> say<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.820> RZ<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
much as let's say the RZ like if you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
much as let's say the RZ like if you
wanted<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> Tony<00:01:31.200> RZ<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> try<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> take

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
wanted to Tony RZ and you try to take

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.310 
wanted to Tony RZ and you try to take
that<00:01:32.220> out<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.670> drifting<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.570> would<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that out for drifting it would be

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.020 
that out for drifting it would be
absolutely<00:01:35.220> insane<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
absolutely insane because I think that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
absolutely insane because I think that
thing<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> hotels<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
thing goes up to hotels in the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.170 
thing goes up to hotels in the
horsepower<00:01:37.680> I'm<00:01:37.920> not<00:01:38.250> entirely<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.970> because

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
horsepower I'm not entirely sure because

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
horsepower I'm not entirely sure because
I<00:01:39.329> haven't<00:01:39.540> tuned<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.869> yet<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I haven't tuned one yet but I think it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
I haven't tuned one yet but I think it
goes<00:01:41.070> either<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:41.729> close<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
goes either very very close to a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
goes either very very close to a
thousand<00:01:42.570> horsepower<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.409> goes

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
thousand horsepower or actually goes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.210 
thousand horsepower or actually goes
past<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.430> thousand<00:01:44.759> horsepower<00:01:44.970> mark<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:46.220> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
past a thousand horsepower mark but this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.660 
past a thousand horsepower mark but this
thing<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.290> pretty<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.409> dead<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.520> had

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thing is pretty much dead on if I had

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
thing is pretty much dead on if I had
just<00:01:50.790> slightly<00:01:51.360> slightly<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.840> horsepower

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
just slightly slightly one horsepower

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
just slightly slightly one horsepower
it'll<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.250> absolutely<00:01:53.399> perfect<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it'll be absolutely perfect but the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.030 
it'll be absolutely perfect but the
suspension<00:01:55.290> setup<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
suspension setup that I have on this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.719 
suspension setup that I have on this
that<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.399> tweaked<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:56.850> bit<00:01:57.229> because<00:01:58.729> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
that I tweaked a little bit because the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.700 
that I tweaked a little bit because the
front<00:02:00.000> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.420> started<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.750> pull<00:02:01.020> into<00:02:01.560> one

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
front kind of started to pull into one

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.219 
front kind of started to pull into one
direction<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.630> kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> fix<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
direction and kind of have to fix that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.920 
direction and kind of have to fix that
but<00:02:04.740> after<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.399> finished<00:02:05.759> tweaking<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
but after I finished tweaking and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.119 
but after I finished tweaking and
messing<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> suspension<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
messing around with the suspension it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.669 
messing around with the suspension it
actually<00:02:08.429> turned<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.729> pretty<00:02:08.970> good<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.679> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
actually turned out pretty good it it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.400 
actually turned out pretty good it it
row<00:02:11.400> fine<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.970> managed<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
row fine I managed to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
row fine I managed to
drive<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.400> into<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> corners<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
drive it into all the corners and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.150 
drive it into all the corners and
actually<00:02:15.750> come<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.080> alive<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> other

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
actually come out alive on the other

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.480 
actually come out alive on the other
side<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:18.600> was<00:02:18.750> fun<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> drive<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.950> didn't

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
side and it was fun to drive it didn't

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.950 
side and it was fun to drive it didn't
have<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.850> said<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.240> horsepower<00:02:21.540> but

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
have as I said a lot of horsepower but

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.540 
have as I said a lot of horsepower but
it<00:02:22.200> was<00:02:22.290> fun<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> drive<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.010> reminded<00:02:23.370> me<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
it was fun to drive it reminded me of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.440 
it was fun to drive it reminded me of
the<00:02:24.860> naturally<00:02:25.860> aspirated<00:02:26.240> Silvius<00:02:27.240> or

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the naturally aspirated Silvius or

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.450 
the naturally aspirated Silvius or
whatever<00:02:27.930> 180s<00:02:28.440> X's<00:02:28.860> or<00:02:28.980> whatever<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> hell

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
whatever 180s X's or whatever the hell

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.970 
whatever 180s X's or whatever the hell
they're<00:02:29.610> called<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.470> do<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.830> those

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
they're called but you do have those

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.380 
they're called but you do have those
naturally<00:02:32.370> aspirated<00:02:32.580> ones<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.120> think<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
naturally aspirated ones I think the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500 
naturally aspirated ones I think the
cues<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:34.610> natural<00:02:35.610> aspirated<00:02:35.970> one<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
cues are natural aspirated one and the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.580 
cues are natural aspirated one and the
case<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:37.230> right

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
case all right

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.400 
case all right
ones<00:02:38.070> with<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.370> turbochargers<00:02:39.120> but<00:02:39.630> they're

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
ones with the turbochargers but they're

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
ones with the turbochargers but they're
very<00:02:40.620> very<00:02:40.950> good<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.550> for<00:02:41.700> example<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.240> I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
very very good like for example this I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.650 
very very good like for example this I
don't<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.850> there's<00:02:45.030> something<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
don't know if there's something about it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.290 
don't know if there's something about it
that<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.780> managed<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:47.430> catch<00:02:47.730> my<00:02:47.970> eye<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
that just managed to to catch my eye and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.930 
that just managed to to catch my eye and
it's<00:02:48.450> actually<00:02:48.720> really<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:48.960> good

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's actually really really good

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.130 
it's actually really really good
now<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> managed<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.360> actually<00:02:51.630> tune<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:52.020> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
now I managed to actually tune one of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.560 
now I managed to actually tune one of
these<00:02:52.260> things<00:02:52.500> an<00:02:52.710> extra<00:02:53.490> one<00:02:53.640> because<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
these things an extra one because I I

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.990 
these things an extra one because I I
bought<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.680> my<00:02:55.830> tuner<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.310> something<00:02:56.640> else<00:02:56.850> I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
bought it my tuner for something else I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.550 
bought it my tuner for something else I
need<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.270> for<00:02:57.420> for<00:02:57.750> normal<00:02:58.020> driving<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.470> like

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
need it for for normal driving for like

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.710 
need it for for normal driving for like
grip<00:02:58.770> racing<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.970> tuned<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> looked

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
grip racing and I tuned it and I looked

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.270 
grip racing and I tuned it and I looked
similar<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> two<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.160> these

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
similar to this and I have two of these

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.330 
similar to this and I have two of these
super<00:03:02.670> asses<00:03:03.150> at<00:03:03.300> ours<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.070> one<00:03:05.070> of<00:03:05.190> them's

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
super asses at ours and one of them's

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.680 
super asses at ours and one of them's
for<00:03:05.580> drifting<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.030> one<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.210> them's<00:03:06.330> for<00:03:06.510> grip

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
for drifting and one of them's for grip

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.770 
for drifting and one of them's for grip
racing<00:03:07.020> which<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.410> very<00:03:07.980> weird<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:09.210> they<00:03:09.600> both

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
racing which is very weird but they both

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.860 
racing which is very weird but they both
look<00:03:09.990> very<00:03:10.200> very<00:03:10.320> similar<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.750> guys

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
look very very similar now if you guys

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.480 
look very very similar now if you guys
have<00:03:12.990> enjoyed<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.260> episode<00:03:13.380> hopefully<00:03:14.160> you
