there is one in the top price as you can

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.029 
there is one in the top price as you can
see<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.699> here<00:00:32.879> it's<00:00:33.839> the<00:00:34.050> Yak<00:00:34.230> bottom<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.010> will

00:00:35.029 --> 00:00:35.039 
see in here it's the Yak bottom you will

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:42.439 
see in here it's the Yak bottom you will
get<00:00:35.339> a<00:00:35.550> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.879> different<00:00:36.539> items<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
get a lot of different items and this is

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.099 
get a lot of different items and this is
how<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.659> build<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.739> need<00:00:43.949> several

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
how we build it you need several

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.899 
how we build it you need several
randomizers<00:00:46.109> and<00:00:46.319> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.519> kind<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
randomizers and this is one kind of

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.849 
randomizers and this is one kind of
randomizer<00:00:48.359> probably<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> easiest<00:00:49.350> way<00:00:49.800> to

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
randomizer probably the easiest way to

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.009 
randomizer probably the easiest way to
build<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.429> randomizer<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
build a randomizer you right now you

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.819 
build a randomizer you right now you
have<00:00:52.589> an<00:00:52.739> dropper<00:00:53.579> facing<00:00:54.149> towards<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.829> upper

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
have an dropper facing towards a upper

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.340 
have an dropper facing towards a upper
and<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:57.409> insider<00:00:58.409> dropper<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.370> put<00:00:59.670> items

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
and the insider dropper you put items

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.829 
and the insider dropper you put items
items<00:01:01.350> fat<00:01:01.530> stacks<00:01:01.889> and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.999> just<00:01:03.269> wet<00:01:03.420> won't

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
items fat stacks and I just wet won't

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.340 
items fat stacks and I just wet won't
stack<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.280> non<00:01:05.549> stackable<00:01:06.170> item<00:01:07.170> when

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
stack and the non stackable item when

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
stack and the non stackable item when
they<00:01:07.560> will<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.579> dropped<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.360> debris

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they will get dropped into the debris

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.670 
they will get dropped into the debris
this<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:11.040> count<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> win<00:01:11.880> Andy<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this will count as a win Andy the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.350 
this will count as a win Andy the
redstone<00:01:14.399> signal<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.840> fruit<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.829> the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
redstone signal will get fruit to the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.649 
redstone signal will get fruit to the
redstone<00:01:18.360> repeater<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:20.149> also<00:01:21.149> use<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
redstone repeater I also use one of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
redstone repeater I also use one of
these<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.409> item<00:01:22.770> recognizer<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
these it's an item recognizer it

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
these it's an item recognizer it
recognized<00:01:24.509> which<00:01:24.750> item<00:01:25.289> you<00:01:25.560> insert<00:01:25.890> into

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
recognized which item you insert into

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.520 
recognized which item you insert into
the<00:01:26.280> hopper<00:01:26.579> in<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.539> case<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.140> iron

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the hopper in this case it's on iron

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.569 
the hopper in this case it's on iron
ingot<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.299> load<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.439> hopper<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.070> 22

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
ingot you just load this hopper with 22

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.050 
ingot you just load this hopper with 22
items<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.479> item<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> accept<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
items of the item I want to accept it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.050 
items of the item I want to accept it
from<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.299> payment<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.430> what<00:01:38.430> happens<00:01:38.820> when

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
from that payment and what happens when

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.740 
from that payment and what happens when
you<00:01:39.329> insert<00:01:39.659> an<00:01:40.430> item<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you insert an item here is that the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.560 
you insert an item here is that the
redstone<00:01:43.140> torch<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.649> flicker<00:01:44.179> to<00:01:45.179> just<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
redstone torch will flicker to just a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929 
redstone torch will flicker to just a
brief<00:01:45.810> moment<00:01:46.109> and<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.799> item<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.729> able

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
brief moment and the item will be able

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.859 
brief moment and the item will be able
to<00:01:48.270> drop<00:01:48.840> into<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.229> chest<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.329> just<00:01:51.329> one<00:01:51.689> item

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to drop into the chest and just one item

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.940 
to drop into the chest and just one item
will<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.259> dropped<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:54.439> it's<00:01:55.439> looked<00:01:55.770> like

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
will be dropped and it's looked like

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.789 
will be dropped and it's looked like
this<00:01:56.929> so<00:01:57.929> that<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.759> torch<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.420> flickers<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this so that the torch just flickers for

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
this so that the torch just flickers for
just<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.249> brief<00:02:02.549> moment<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:06.210> lost<00:02:06.450> in

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
just a brief moment and when lost in

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.910 
just a brief moment and when lost in
space<00:02:06.840> 1<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.380> son<00:02:07.679> toggle<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.459> redstone<00:02:09.450> clock

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
space 1 it son toggle a redstone clock

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.380 
space 1 it son toggle a redstone clock
that's<00:02:10.920> very<00:02:11.099> simple<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> build<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's very simple to build and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.520 
that's very simple to build and
fast<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.520> comparator<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
fast and it's just an comparator in the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.890 
fast and it's just an comparator in the
English<00:02:17.340> V<00:02:18.090> state<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.569> can<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.520> it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
English V state as you can see and it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
English V state as you can see and it's
connected<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.200> dropper<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.100> will<00:02:23.340> drop

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
connected to a dropper and it will drop

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.170 
connected to a dropper and it will drop
a<00:02:23.850> lot<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.300> items<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.980> when<00:02:26.190> i<00:02:26.280> use<00:02:26.520> an<00:02:26.819> pulse

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
a lot of items and when i use an pulse

redstone signal will be on for just a
moment<00:02:38.970> longer<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.400> extend<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.350> but

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
moment longer and you can extend it but

moment longer and you can extend it but
by<00:02:43.739> just<00:02:44.130> adding<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.880> repeaters<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:47.040> you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
by just adding more repeaters if you

by just adding more repeaters if you
want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.360> signal<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:49.020> on<00:02:49.530> for<00:02:50.370> even

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
want to the signal to be on for even

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.259 
want to the signal to be on for even
longer<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.519> look<00:02:53.790> at<00:02:53.910> everything

together it looks at this you can see
there<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.430> n<00:02:56.610> misers<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> pulse
