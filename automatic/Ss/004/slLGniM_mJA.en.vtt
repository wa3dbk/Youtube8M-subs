see without even touching it the pasta

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
see without even touching it the pasta
is<00:01:31.470> falling<00:01:32.070> naturally<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> water

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is falling naturally as the water

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
is falling naturally as the water
softens<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:34.259> such<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.310> it's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
softens it up into such a way that it's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.219 
softens it up into such a way that it's
not<00:01:35.640> sort<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.880> sitting<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.600> top<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.900> each<00:01:36.990> other
