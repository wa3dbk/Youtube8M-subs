00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.110
 well let's make a cat collar 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.860
 or for small dog this tape 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.860
 polypropylene here I have 43 centimeters 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.820
 it can be less and we will also occupy 2 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.779
 soda can rings can be 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.880
 originals from the cans of 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.360
 true refreshment or how are you from 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.200
 plastic that are very cool make them 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.200
 Various colors 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.469
 you are color 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.130
 it's very easy we take one of the chips and 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.570
 we put the tape through a hole the 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:55.579
 we take out the other 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.010
 this side are not doubles and so and here 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.050
 let's do a sewing can be to 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.120
 hand does not need to be machine 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.680
 but it does have to be well reinforced 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.780
 be several passes that looks good 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.700
 riveted or you can also use a 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.659
 metallic rivet 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.659
 just like that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:22.070
 Well now the other tab or ring 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.070
 we put it like that with a hole 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.990
 and now we have the tape again 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.590
 the first ring through a hole 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.159
 the other one again 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.159
 in that 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 here we stretch so that what 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.450
 together 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.649
 yes 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.100
 we will use this end as if it were 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.100
 a buckle 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.830
 full 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.800
 and it's adjustable 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.649
 if we want smaller than 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.649
 we have to do is go through the file 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.069
 near the end of the strap as 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.549
 possible 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.549
 in there 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 we have 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.750
 again as just granadilla 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.150
 and already it became small or smaller it 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.040
 can still do 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.530
 and if we want to take advantage of the strap more 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.530
 long we go through the file 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.980
 as close to each other as possible 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.580
 with that 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580
 that 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.850
 again the villa 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.329
 we already have a bigger necklace 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.210
 if you want you can put here a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.160
 ring with a pendant for cats with the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.160
 Name plate a bell 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.700
