what I take it for so I'm going with

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.150 
what I take it for so I'm going with
Infinity<00:03:15.569> Ward<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.049> one<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.739> thinking

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
Infinity Ward on this one I'm thinking

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
to the weapons to improve them ever so

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.229 
to the weapons to improve them ever so
slightly<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:38.609> exactly<00:03:38.940> what's

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
slightly and that's exactly what's

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.729 
slightly and that's exactly what's
happened<00:03:39.599> in<00:03:39.780> my<00:03:39.959> opinion<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.440> lot<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.650> the

happened in my opinion to a lot of the

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.159 
happened in my opinion to a lot of the
guns<00:03:40.859> m16<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.819> mean<00:03:42.299> it's<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.780> groundbreaking

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
guns m16 I mean it's not groundbreaking

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.659 
guns m16 I mean it's not groundbreaking
I<00:03:43.530> mean<00:03:43.650> it's<00:03:43.829> not<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.340> sudden<00:03:44.609> the

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
I mean it's not all of a sudden the

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.629 
I mean it's not all of a sudden the
modern<00:03:44.940> warfare<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.450> FAMAS<00:03:45.840> or<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.459> m16<00:03:47.459> for

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
modern warfare to FAMAS or the m16 for

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.729 
modern warfare to FAMAS or the m16 for
modern<00:03:47.849> warfare<00:03:47.940> 2<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:48.510> stopping<00:03:48.750> power<00:03:49.049> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
modern warfare 2 but stopping power it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.039 
modern warfare 2 but stopping power it's
not<00:03:49.859> like<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.669> I<00:03:50.700> mean<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.540> gun<00:03:51.780> it

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
not like that at all I mean the gun it

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.390 
not like that at all I mean the gun it
just<00:03:52.260> feels<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.680> hit<00:03:52.799> detection<00:03:52.919> is<00:03:53.340> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
just feels like the hit detection is a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.280 
just feels like the hit detection is a
lot<00:03:53.669> better<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.419> kills<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.959> way<00:03:55.109> it

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
lot better and it kills the way it

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.830 
lot better and it kills the way it
should<00:03:55.319> kill<00:03:55.799> in<00:03:55.950> modern<00:03:56.220> warfare<00:03:56.340> 3<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:57.720> know

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
should kill in modern warfare 3 you know

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.839 
should kill in modern warfare 3 you know
you<00:03:57.900> go<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.169> other<00:03:58.379> guns<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.919> ak-47

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
you go to other guns like the ak-47

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.960 
you go to other guns like the ak-47
ak-47<00:04:00.569> feels<00:04:01.230> brilliant<00:04:01.919> I<00:04:02.010> love<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:02.760> gun

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
ak-47 feels brilliant I love that gun

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.699 
ak-47 feels brilliant I love that gun
now<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:03.510> needed<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:03.989> mo<00:04:04.139> laughing<00:04:04.349> with<00:04:04.560> that

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
now I needed up mo laughing with that

now I needed up mo laughing with that
one<00:04:04.859> too<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.250> mean<00:04:05.430> that's<00:04:05.609> not<00:04:05.790> the

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
one too and I mean that's not the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.699 
one too and I mean that's not the
easiest<00:04:05.970> gun<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.629> Moab<00:04:06.810> with<00:04:07.200> because<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.620> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
easiest gun to Moab with because of that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.589 
easiest gun to Moab with because of that
visual<00:04:08.129> recoil<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.819> know<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.000> gun<00:04:09.180> bouncing

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
visual recoil you know the gun bouncing

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.319 
visual recoil you know the gun bouncing
up<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.810> down<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:11.160> just<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.760> solid<00:04:12.150> gun

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
up and down it's just it's a solid gun

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.270 
up and down it's just it's a solid gun
now<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.780> mean<00:04:13.169> it<00:04:13.319> was<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> saw<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.739> gun<00:04:13.919> before<00:04:14.099> I

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
now I mean it was a saw a gun before I

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.069 
now I mean it was a saw a gun before I
put<00:04:14.519> up<00:04:14.609> mini<00:04:14.760> gameplays<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.389> really<00:04:15.900> like

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
put up mini gameplays but I really like

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.250 
put up mini gameplays but I really like
it<00:04:16.260> now<00:04:16.380> also<00:04:17.099> things<00:04:17.729> like<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.090> ump45<00:04:18.720> just

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
it now also things like the ump45 just

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.860 
it now also things like the ump45 just
feel<00:04:19.470> ridiculously<00:04:20.160> strong<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.630> know<00:04:21.750> they

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
feel ridiculously strong you know they

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.300 
feel ridiculously strong you know they
say<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.289> they<00:04:22.500> took<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.800> gun<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.159> was

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
say that they took a gun that was

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.520 
say that they took a gun that was
already<00:04:23.820> really<00:04:24.180> real

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
already really real

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.830 
already really real
good<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.980> then<00:04:25.010> on<00:04:25.550> top<00:04:25.760> of<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.090> they<00:04:26.660> have

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
good and then on top of that they have

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.820 
good and then on top of that they have
now<00:04:26.990> added<00:04:27.500> extra<00:04:28.010> damage<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.870> insane

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
now added extra damage to it it's insane

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.280 
now added extra damage to it it's insane
