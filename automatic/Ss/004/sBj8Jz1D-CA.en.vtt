00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
as coaching a hockey team so it's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of the biggest things that I love about

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
of the biggest things that I love about
this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.720> easier<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> lot

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this is that it's a lot easier but a lot

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.830 
this is that it's a lot easier but a lot
harder<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> same<00:01:23.700> time<00:01:23.970> compared<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
harder at the same time compared to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
harder at the same time compared to
treyarch<00:01:25.229> dombey's<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.040> seems<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.610> at

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
treyarch dombey's now it seems like at

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
treyarch dombey's now it seems like at
the<00:01:26.909> beginning<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.659> game<00:01:27.840> everything

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the beginning of the game everything

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
the beginning of the game everything
just<00:01:28.829> goes<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.460> smoothly<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.299> quickly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just goes very smoothly very quickly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
just goes very smoothly very quickly
going<00:01:30.930> into<00:01:31.229> high<00:01:31.409> rounds<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.189> once<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.579> get

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
going into high rounds but once you get

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
going into high rounds but once you get
up<00:01:32.909> into<00:01:33.090> those<00:01:33.270> higher<00:01:33.600> rounds<00:01:34.049> maybe<00:01:34.320> like

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
up into those higher rounds maybe like

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.789 
up into those higher rounds maybe like
18<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.430> 20<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.210> 25<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:36.990> something<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
18 to 20 to 25 or something like that it

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
18 to 20 to 25 or something like that it
just<00:01:38.280> seems<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.790> never<00:01:39.060> ends<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
just seems like it never ends and it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
just seems like it never ends and it
seems<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.680> extremely<00:01:41.189> hard<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
seems like it's just extremely hard to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.460 
seems like it's just extremely hard to
do<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.659> sledgehammer<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
do and that's because sledgehammer and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.160 
do and that's because sledgehammer and
Raven<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> great<00:01:44.790> job<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:45.360> actually<00:01:45.930> making

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
Raven did a great job at actually making

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
Raven did a great job at actually making
these<00:01:46.439> zombies<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.430> point<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> where

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
these zombies have some point to where

to<00:01:56.729> every<00:01:57.390> single<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:57.990> because<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.380> can't

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829

they're giving little teases here and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.810 
they're giving little teases here and
there<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.070> actually<00:03:22.250> want<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.550> do<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> video

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820

on<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.300> zombies<00:03:23.660> storyline<00:03:23.840> that'll<00:03:24.800> be

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
on the zombies storyline that'll be

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.620 
on the zombies storyline that'll be
coming<00:03:25.040> shortly<00:03:25.220> here<00:03:25.940> maybe<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> next

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
coming shortly here maybe the next

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.630 
coming shortly here maybe the next
couple<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.900> days<00:03:27.080> but<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.680> easter<00:03:28.070> egg<00:03:28.220> itself

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
couple of days but the easter egg itself

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.480 
couple of days but the easter egg itself
was<00:03:29.240> actually<00:03:29.750> very<00:03:29.900> cool<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:30.740> also<00:03:30.770> kind<00:03:31.070> of

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
was actually very cool but also kind of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.740 
was actually very cool but also kind of
disappointing<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> same<00:03:32.180> point<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.420> time<00:03:32.570> if

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
disappointing the same point in time if

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.450 
disappointing the same point in time if
you're<00:03:32.840> an<00:03:33.020> easter<00:03:33.320> egg<00:03:33.410> hunter<00:03:33.830> or<00:03:34.010> you

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
you're an easter egg hunter or you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.970 
you're an easter egg hunter or you
actually<00:03:35.030> just<00:03:35.180> love<00:03:35.630> backstory<00:03:36.350> easter<00:03:36.830> eggs

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
actually just love backstory easter eggs

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.160 
actually just love backstory easter eggs
like<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.520> the<00:03:38.000> ending<00:03:38.330> wasn't<00:03:38.600> that<00:03:38.870> great

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
like that the ending wasn't that great

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.050 
like that the ending wasn't that great
but<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.470> also<00:03:39.650> was<00:03:39.980> a<00:03:40.010> dumbed<00:03:40.340> down<00:03:40.460> more

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
but it also was a dumbed down more

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.880 
but it also was a dumbed down more
easier<00:03:41.420> version<00:03:41.750> than<00:03:42.110> what<00:03:42.350> we'd<00:03:42.500> see<00:03:42.680> in<00:03:42.830> a

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
easier version than what we'd see in a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.920 
easier version than what we'd see in a
treyarch<00:03:43.310> version<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.820> zombies<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.390> that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
treyarch version of zombies and that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.750 
treyarch version of zombies and that
itself<00:03:45.320> isn't<00:03:45.620> necessarily<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.430> bad<00:03:46.700> thing

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
itself isn't necessarily a bad thing

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.490 
itself isn't necessarily a bad thing
because<00:03:47.330> there<00:03:47.750> are<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.900> lot<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.110> people<00:03:48.230> that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
because there are a lot of people that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.960 
because there are a lot of people that
may<00:03:48.740> in<00:03:48.860> fact<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.340> be<00:03:49.430> getting<00:03:49.550> turned<00:03:49.820> on<00:03:49.910> a

makes the map pack alone worth it I
