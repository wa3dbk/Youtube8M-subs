00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.460
 press tour discharge and friends my name is 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.560
 novels daniel and so i will show today 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.990
 you do not have a workout program for del 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.990
 one exercise you can 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.270
 use during your workout 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.340
 delta this technique used ronnie 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.869
 Coleman the very beginning of his 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.599
 competitive career with him 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.880
 it turns out there were problems of only 100 Mbps 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.309
 Is it the tariff muscles and there is help 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.850
 this technique he overcame you for cost 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.730
 in growth del and managed to expand into account 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.730
 side delta and so it will swing 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.920
 dumbbells to the sides while standing and performing we 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.559
 will this exercise now all these in 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.629
 such a big vegan network 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.480
 consisting of small of 4 minus and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.030
 pause between me with this mini will be under 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.460
 mini set stone from this we will 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.350
 increase working weight i.e. first not 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.089
 site you work with a little weight on 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 a large number of repetitions namely 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.430
 by 25 reps gradually increasing 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.590
 your working weight, respectively 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.909
 recurrences go down and so ronnie 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.000
 Coleman was doing dumbbell layout 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.730
 as follows 1 out of 100 kilogram 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.330
 dumbbells for 25 reps 15 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.600
 kilogram dumbbells for 15 reps 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.930
 20 kilogram for 10 repetitions and 24 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 kilograms of dumbbells for 8 reps you 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.190
 of course, pick up forests for yourself 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.860
 I also picked them up in my own way and you 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.160
 choose for yourself adequate for yourself 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.160
 weight 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.530
 In principle, this scheme can 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.620
 use for any of the beam 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.320
 deltoid rear middle front then 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.480
 there is the way about which you want 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.430
 grow in volume there for a certain time 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.830
 folders with code use this scheme 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.140
 there are two to four approaches 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.630
 it will be quite enough to just 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.970
 tear your mean then pray any 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.070
 the delta bundles will perform puts their muscles and 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.190
 so guys on this all hope the video was 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.770
 for you useful with you dope daniel 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.770
 Good luck and good health and see you soon
