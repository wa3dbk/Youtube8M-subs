00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.749 

I<00:01:48.290> thought<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.650> was<00:01:48.740> great<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:48.979> mean<00:01:49.159> they're

I thought it was great I mean they're
they're<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> unit<00:01:51.500> now<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:51.830> it's<00:01:51.950> not<00:01:52.070> growing

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
they're a unit now so it's not growing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.160 
they're a unit now so it's not growing
pains<00:01:52.820> anymore<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.509> now<00:01:53.659> just<00:01:53.930> kind<00:01:54.110> of

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
pains anymore it's it's now just kind of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.460 
pains anymore it's it's now just kind of
internal<00:01:54.500> conflict<00:01:55.540> trying<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.689> operate<00:01:57.200> as<00:01:57.439> a

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
internal conflict trying to operate as a

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.320 
internal conflict trying to operate as a
team<00:01:57.740> as<00:01:57.920> opposed<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.729> how<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.909> form<00:01:59.390> one

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.600 

I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:04.110> he's<00:02:04.470> certainly<00:02:04.830> giving<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> orders

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
I think he's certainly giving the orders

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.999 
I think he's certainly giving the orders
but<00:02:06.480> it's<00:02:06.600> not<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.900> type<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.260> hierarchy<00:02:07.440> where

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
but it's not the type of hierarchy where

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.310 
but it's not the type of hierarchy where
he<00:02:08.460> gives<00:02:08.610> commands<00:02:09.180> and<00:02:09.600> people<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> do

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
he gives commands and people have to do

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020 
he gives commands and people have to do
it<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.800> purely<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.400> sense<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.820> one

there<00:02:22.860> still<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.640> know<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.940> loose<00:02:24.210> chain<00:02:24.450> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
there still is you know a loose chain of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.680 
there still is you know a loose chain of
command<00:02:24.930> no<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.440> technically<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.130> charge

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
command no one is technically in charge

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.260 
command no one is technically in charge
but<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.930> cap<00:02:28.110> certainly<00:02:28.470> does<00:02:28.880> lean<00:02:29.880> towards

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
but but cap certainly does lean towards

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.740 
but but cap certainly does lean towards
the<00:02:30.390> side<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.840> structure<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.980> know<00:02:32.100> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the side of structure and you know a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.940 
the side of structure and you know a
hierarchy<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.290> when<00:02:34.650> they're<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
hierarchy so so when they're on the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.140 
hierarchy so so when they're on the
battlefield<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.460> think<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.730> one<00:02:35.850> he<00:02:35.940> feels

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
battlefield I think it's one he feels

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.610 
battlefield I think it's one he feels
most<00:02:36.270> comfortable

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680
