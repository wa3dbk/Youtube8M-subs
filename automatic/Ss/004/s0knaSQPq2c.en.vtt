tech<00:00:20.599> with<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.840> lands<00:00:21.290> so<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.890> first<00:00:22.070> two<00:00:22.250> are

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
tech with the lands so the first two are

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.659 
tech with the lands so the first two are
inked<00:00:22.579> moth<00:00:22.820> Nexus<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.450> blink<00:00:23.900> moth<00:00:24.140> Nexus

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
inked moth Nexus and blink moth Nexus

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.729 
inked moth Nexus and blink moth Nexus
ink<00:00:25.669> moth<00:00:25.910> Nexus<00:00:26.390> is<00:00:26.540> fantastic<00:00:27.320> because<00:00:27.500> it

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:27.739 
ink moth Nexus is fantastic because it

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.229 
ink moth Nexus is fantastic because it
allows<00:00:27.890> you<00:00:28.099> to<00:00:28.220> kill<00:00:28.399> your<00:00:28.520> opponent<00:00:28.579> using

allows you to kill your opponent using
infect<00:00:29.750> counters<00:00:30.259> so<00:00:31.099> anyone<00:00:31.610> that's<00:00:31.820> trying

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
infect counters so anyone that's trying

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.840 
infect counters so anyone that's trying
to<00:00:32.450> win<00:00:32.689> with<00:00:33.020> some<00:00:33.620> sort<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:33.920> life<00:00:34.250> game<00:00:34.520> built

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
to win with some sort of life game built

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.389 
to win with some sort of life game built
into<00:00:35.210> their<00:00:35.329> strategy<00:00:35.600> is<00:00:36.399> completely

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
into their strategy is completely

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.500 
into their strategy is completely
nullified<00:00:37.910> by<00:00:38.179> the<00:00:38.210> power<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.800> infect<00:00:40.510> blink

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
nullified by the power of infect blink

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.049 
nullified by the power of infect blink
moth<00:00:41.719> Nexus<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.469> also<00:00:43.039> great<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:43.789> just

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
moth Nexus is also great and it's just

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.849 
moth Nexus is also great and it's just
because<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.660> allows<00:00:44.929> you<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.230> put<00:00:45.440> in<00:00:45.469> just<00:00:45.769> a

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
because it allows you to put in just a

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.709 
because it allows you to put in just a
little<00:00:46.190> bit<00:00:46.339> more<00:00:46.519> damage<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.210> gives<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:47.510> one

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
little bit more damage and gives you one

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.049 
little bit more damage and gives you one
more<00:00:47.929> attacker<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:49.100> way<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.339> can<00:00:49.579> go<00:00:49.730> wide

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
more attacker that way you can go wide

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.410 
more attacker that way you can go wide
on<00:00:50.359> your<00:00:50.539> opponent<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:52.280> next<00:00:52.550> land<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.030> dark

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
on your opponent the next land is dark

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.439 
on your opponent the next land is dark

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
steel sindel dark steel Citadel is very

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.270 
steel sindel dark steel Citadel is very
important<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.019> it<00:00:57.320> ups<00:00:57.620> your<00:00:57.859> number<00:00:58.159> of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
important because it ups your number of

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.000 
important because it ups your number of
artifacts<00:00:58.789> for<00:00:59.690> example<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.409> works<00:01:00.559> well<00:01:00.829> with

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
artifacts for example it works well with

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.110 
artifacts for example it works well with
our<00:01:01.129> next<00:01:01.550> piece<00:01:01.760> of<00:01:01.999> land<00:01:02.350> glimmer<00:01:03.350> void<00:01:04.120> this

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
our next piece of land glimmer void this

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.050 
our next piece of land glimmer void this
can<00:01:05.360> produce<00:01:05.570> any<00:01:05.960> color<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.740> mana<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.430> in

can produce any color of mana and in

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.840 
can produce any color of mana and in
this<00:01:08.270> deck<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.870> always<00:01:09.560> turned<00:01:09.979> on<00:01:10.220> to<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.579> so

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
this deck is always turned on to do so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.649 
this deck is always turned on to do so
if<00:01:11.240> your<00:01:12.079> glimmer<00:01:12.320> void<00:01:12.649> does<00:01:12.920> get<00:01:13.220> sacrificed

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
if your glimmer void does get sacrificed

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.660 
if your glimmer void does get sacrificed
that<00:01:14.659> means<00:01:14.930> you've<00:01:15.170> got<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.439> big<00:01:15.890> problem

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
that means you've got a big problem

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.230 
that means you've got a big problem
already<00:01:17.110> in<00:01:18.110> our<00:01:18.320> last<00:01:18.530> land<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.520> singleton

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
already in our last land is a singleton

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.560 
already in our last land is a singleton
Island<00:01:21.250> next<00:01:22.250> let's<00:01:22.549> go<00:01:22.610> over<00:01:22.729> our<00:01:22.939> creatures

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
so the first ones are ornithopter signal

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.670 
so the first ones are ornithopter signal
pest<00:01:28.070> vault<00:01:28.790> scourge<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.509> mem<00:01:30.140> Knight

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
you to put a lot of artifacts on the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.969 
you to put a lot of artifacts on the
field<00:01:37.460> quite<00:01:37.850> quickly<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.979> synergize

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
field quite quickly and synergize

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.130

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
so while they might not look

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660 
so while they might not look
individually<00:01:44.210> powerful<00:01:45.140> within<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.189> overall

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
individually powerful within the overall

strategy<00:01:46.969> they're<00:01:47.869> fantastic<00:01:48.890> our<00:01:49.850> next

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
strategy they're fantastic our next

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.690 
strategy they're fantastic our next
creature<00:01:50.390> is<00:01:50.630> arc<00:01:50.930> bound<00:01:51.170> ravager<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> this

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
creature is arc bound ravager and this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.660 
creature is arc bound ravager and this
guy<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:52.939> really<00:01:53.659> important<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.070> his<00:01:55.399> first

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
guy is really important so his first

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.109 
guy is really important so his first
ability<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.979> amazing<00:01:57.979> what<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.369> does<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:58.909> it

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
ability is amazing what it does is it

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.330 
ability is amazing what it does is it
allows<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.570> sacrifice<00:02:00.140> artifacts<00:02:01.039> in

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
allows you to sacrifice artifacts in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.069 
allows you to sacrifice artifacts in
order<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.729> put<00:02:01.880> plus<00:02:02.060> one<00:02:02.299> plus<00:02:02.450> one<00:02:02.539> counters

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
order to put plus one plus one counters

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.840 
order to put plus one plus one counters
on<00:02:03.259> him<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:03.920> maybe<00:02:04.070> you've<00:02:04.280> got<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.429> little<00:02:04.700> too

on him so maybe you've got a little too

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.359 
on him so maybe you've got a little too
much<00:02:05.060> land<00:02:05.450> all<00:02:05.810> right<00:02:06.409> well<00:02:06.619> let's<00:02:06.829> take<00:02:07.159> that

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
much land all right well let's take that

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.919 
much land all right well let's take that
dark<00:02:07.579> steel<00:02:07.820> Citadel<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.420> turn<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.780> into

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929
