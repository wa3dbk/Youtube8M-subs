00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
know I probably experiment a little bit

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.309 
know I probably experiment a little bit
more<00:02:57.970> maybe<00:02:58.209> change<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.720> bait<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.109> stuff

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
more maybe change the bait and stuff

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.150
