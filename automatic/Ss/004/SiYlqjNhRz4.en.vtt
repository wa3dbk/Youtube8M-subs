of the computer but it does require a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.790 
of the computer but it does require a
special<00:01:38.860> screwdriver<00:01:39.130> head<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:40.470> took<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.590> top

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
special screwdriver head I took the top

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.280 
special screwdriver head I took the top
piece<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.580> arm<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:43.060> my<00:01:43.180> iMac<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.930> marked

piece of the arm of my iMac and I marked

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.810 
piece of the arm of my iMac and I marked
where<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> holes<00:01:44.800> were<00:01:45.040> with<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> pencil<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
where the holes were with a pencil and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.060 
where the holes were with a pencil and
then<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.720> is<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.050> I<00:01:47.080> can<00:01:47.350> easily<00:01:47.500> drill<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
then this is so I can easily drill the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.030 
then this is so I can easily drill the
holes<00:01:48.310> onto<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.850> doorstop<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.800> traced<00:01:50.800> each

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
holes onto the doorstop I traced each

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.010 
holes onto the doorstop I traced each
hole<00:01:51.340> onto<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.850> doorstop<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.600> i<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.840> drill

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
hole onto the doorstop so i can drill

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.529 
hole onto the doorstop so i can drill
them<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.649> what<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.950> looked<00:01:54.130> like<00:01:54.539> the

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
them and this is what it looked like the

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.510 
them and this is what it looked like the

in the open part of the base so your

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.020 
in the open part of the base so your
cover<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.829> bottom<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.310> still<00:02:51.640> screw<00:02:51.880> in
