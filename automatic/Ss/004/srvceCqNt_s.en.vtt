00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.929 

in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.650> tutorial<00:00:01.860> we'll<00:00:02.370> take<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> look<00:00:02.850> at

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.539 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at
how<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.290> get<00:00:04.290> an<00:00:04.410> object<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.830> follow<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.220> curved

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
how to get an object to follow a curved

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.309 
how to get an object to follow a curved
path<00:00:05.850> but<00:00:06.120> not<00:00:06.210> only<00:00:06.480> just<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> follow<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.049> path

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
path but not only just to follow a path

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.440 
path but not only just to follow a path
but<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> keep<00:00:08.280> itself<00:00:08.519> aligned<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.420> that

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
but how to keep itself aligned with that

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.299 
but how to keep itself aligned with that
path<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.170> say<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.650> instance<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.190> you're

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
path so say for instance if you're

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.890 
path so say for instance if you're
firing<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.759> missile<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.330> don't<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
firing a missile you don't want the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.299 
firing a missile you don't want the
missile<00:00:13.530> always<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> point<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.250> same

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
missile always to point in the same

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.890 
missile always to point in the same
direction<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.880> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> follow<00:00:15.240> along<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
direction you want to follow along the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.830 
direction you want to follow along the
trajectory<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> path<00:00:17.070> alright<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.119> we

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
trajectory of the path alright so we

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
trajectory of the path alright so we
have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> cylinder<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> scene<00:00:20.010> so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
have a cylinder here in the scene so

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
have a cylinder here in the scene so
let's<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.880> cut<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.720> down<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.140> size<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
let's just cut this down to size a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.410 
let's just cut this down to size a
little<00:00:22.619> bit<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:23.970> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.330> an

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
little bit so we have kind of an

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
little bit so we have kind of an
orientation<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> when<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> put<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> path

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
orientation with it when we put a path

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.040 
orientation with it when we put a path
in<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> scene<00:00:27.380> all<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:28.769> I'll<00:00:29.070> add<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
in the scene all right then I'll add a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.979 
in the scene all right then I'll add a
lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> curve<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> scene<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.510> curve<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.780> path

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
lot of curve to the scene a curve a path

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.729 
lot of curve to the scene a curve a path
right<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:35.510> where<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.500> over<00:00:37.620> here

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right here where is this so over here

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.330 
right here where is this so over here
somewhere

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
somewhere

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
somewhere
move<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> over<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:38.940> must<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.750> below<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
move it over here must be down below the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.760 
move it over here must be down below the
surface<00:00:40.170> there<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.940> there

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
surface there it is right there

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.970 
surface there it is right there
alright<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.250> look<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.460> close<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.220 

and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.219> we'll<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.430> edit<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.050> bit

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and then we'll just edit it a little bit

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.939 
and then we'll just edit it a little bit
edit<00:00:52.800> mode<00:00:53.010> grab<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> point<00:00:54.500> I'll<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.559> move

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
edit mode grab that point I'll just move

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.849 
edit mode grab that point I'll just move
this<00:00:56.059> portion<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> curve<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.859> grab

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
this portion of the curve up here grab

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.760 
this portion of the curve up here grab
this<00:00:59.010> point<00:00:59.280> move<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.820> up<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.770> alright

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this point move this one up here alright

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
this point move this one up here alright
so<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.890> want<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> make<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.430> curve<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.149> object

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
so I want to make this curve this object

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
so I want to make this curve this object
follow<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> curve<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> edit<00:01:05.519> mode

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
follow the curve so get out of edit mode

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
follow the curve so get out of edit mode
so<00:01:06.510> select<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> parent

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so select this and I'm going to parent

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.630 
so select this and I'm going to parent
it<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> curve<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:10.020> ctrl<00:01:10.380> P<00:01:10.640> I'm

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it to the curve and with ctrl P I'm

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.570 
it to the curve and with ctrl P I'm
gonna<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> follow<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> path<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
gonna make it follow the path like this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.880 
gonna make it follow the path like this
now<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.720> press<00:01:15.990> alt<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.619> right

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
now if I was just just press alt a right

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
now if I was just just press alt a right
now<00:01:17.130> let's<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.640> what<00:01:17.759> happens<00:01:18.710> well<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
now let's see what happens well it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.020 
now let's see what happens well it
doesn't<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.640> following

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
doesn't really look like it's following

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.859 
doesn't really look like it's following
the<00:01:21.150> path<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.030> take<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> look<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.720> where

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the path but if you take a look at where

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
the path but if you take a look at where
the<00:01:25.110> dotted<00:01:25.619> line<00:01:25.799> points<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.369> points<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the dotted line points it points to this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
the dotted line points it points to this
end<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> curve<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.799> have

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
end of the curve right here so we have

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
end of the curve right here so we have
to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> first<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.270> set<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
to do you have to first of all set this

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
to do you have to first of all set this
at<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.829> location<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:32.850> look<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
at that location so we'll look at it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.260 
at that location so we'll look at it
from<00:01:33.329> above<00:01:35.630> where<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.729> that's<00:01:38.729> oh<00:01:39.090> no

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
from above where is that that's oh no

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.649 
from above where is that that's oh no
there<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:39.900> alright<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.659> I'm

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
there it is right there alright so I'm

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.710 
there it is right there alright so I'm
just<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:42.930> take<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> place<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> right

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
just gonna take it and place it right

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
just gonna take it and place it right
approximately<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:46.079> let<00:01:46.950> me<00:01:47.009> zoom<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
approximately there let me zoom in a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.420 
approximately there let me zoom in a
little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.829> go<00:01:49.829> into<00:01:49.950> wireframe<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
little bit on that go into wireframe and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.179 
little bit on that go into wireframe and
then<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.549> gonna<00:01:53.670> set<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.180> close<00:01:54.710> okay<00:01:55.740> that's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
then I'm gonna set as close okay that's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.280 
then I'm gonna set as close okay that's
funny<00:01:56.579> that's<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> strange<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
funny that's kind of strange that the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
funny that's kind of strange that the
pointed<00:01:58.860> line<00:01:59.070> should<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> sitting<00:02:00.270> right

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
pointed line should be sitting right

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.289 
pointed line should be sitting right
there

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
there

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
there
which<00:02:03.299> should<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.719> right<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
which should be right at the end so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.770 
which should be right at the end so
we're<00:02:05.340> gonna<00:02:05.430> try<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> both<00:02:05.939> ways<00:02:06.240> we'll<00:02:06.570> set

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
we're gonna try it both ways we'll set

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.859 
we're gonna try it both ways we'll set
it<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> tip<00:02:07.550> where<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.970> suspect<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it right at the tip where I suspect it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.980 
it right at the tip where I suspect it
should<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.459> maybe<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.940> way<00:02:12.090> its<00:02:12.239> parent

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
should be but maybe the way its parent

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350 
should be but maybe the way its parent
it<00:02:13.170> has<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.710> be<00:02:13.800> said<00:02:14.010> exactly<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.670> all

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it has to be said exactly there all

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
it has to be said exactly there all
right<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.930> let's<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:16.260> back<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.560> look<00:02:16.890> at

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
right so now let's go back and look at

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.270 
right so now let's go back and look at
the<00:02:17.100> animation<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:19.290> time<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.830> see<00:02:23.040> how<00:02:23.070> it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the animation this time and see how it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.610 
the animation this time and see how it
looks<00:02:23.340> relative<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.390> path<00:02:24.600> itself<00:02:25.110> all

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
looks relative to the path itself all

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.860 
looks relative to the path itself all
right

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
right

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.960 
right
so<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.960> looks<00:02:28.110> pretty<00:02:28.170> good<00:02:31.670> let's<00:02:32.670> try<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
so it looks pretty good let's try it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.250 
so it looks pretty good let's try it
again<00:02:37.460> so<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.610> get<00:02:38.730> my<00:02:38.910> timeline<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.570> here<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
again so you get my timeline up here so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.350 
again so you get my timeline up here so
I<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.620> where<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.190> scene<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.760 

so<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.840> following<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.620> if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
so you can see it's following it but if

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.910 
so you can see it's following it but if
this<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.690> curve<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.350> parabolic

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
this was a curve you know parabolic

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.380 
this was a curve you know parabolic
curves<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.460> upward<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.270> were

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
curves it was upward and you were

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.880 
curves it was upward and you were
shooting<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.870> missile<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.560> wouldn't<00:02:52.770> want

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
shooting a missile now you wouldn't want

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.290 
shooting a missile now you wouldn't want
to<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.340> pointing<00:02:53.730> straight<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.210> you

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
to just be pointing straight up so you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.440 
to just be pointing straight up so you
have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.770> align<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.820> path<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
have to align this with the path so

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.110 
have to align this with the path so
listen<00:02:58.260> once<00:02:58.500> again<00:02:58.800> let's<00:02:59.130> first<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.060> all

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
listen once again let's first of all

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.630 
listen once again let's first of all
tilt<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.630> 90<00:03:01.020> degrees<00:03:02.270> point<00:03:03.270> X<00:03:04.160> there's<00:03:05.160> 90

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
tilt this 90 degrees point X there's 90

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:15.130 
tilt this 90 degrees point X there's 90
degrees<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.480> whoops<00:03:12.560> there<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.940> then

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
degrees like that whoops there and then

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.880 
degrees like that whoops there and then
so<00:03:16.140> let's<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:18.170> yeah<00:03:19.170> actually<00:03:19.320> that<00:03:19.530> might

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
so let's just yeah actually that might

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.990 
so let's just yeah actually that might
do<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.340> starters<00:03:22.310> okay<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.520> then<00:03:23.730> let's

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
do it for starters okay and then let's

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.990 
do it for starters okay and then let's
align<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.630> with<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.140> curve<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:26.100> tangent

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
align it with the curve so it's tangent

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.630 
align it with the curve so it's tangent
to<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.270> curve<00:03:27.300> at<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:29.120> starting<00:03:30.120> point<00:03:30.150> here

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.190 

so<00:03:35.640> we'll<00:03:35.790> zoom<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.360> see<00:03:36.600> if<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:36.750> can<00:03:36.900> see<00:03:37.170> it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so we'll zoom in see if we can see it

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.870 
so we'll zoom in see if we can see it
all<00:03:38.070> right<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.310> then<00:03:38.400> we're<00:03:38.520> going<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.670> rotate

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
all right and then we're going to rotate

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.690 
all right and then we're going to rotate
it<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.390> what<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.710> not<00:03:40.860> doing<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.490> so

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
it and what I do it it's not doing it so

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.300 
it and what I do it it's not doing it so
basically<00:03:42.660> if<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.230> notice<00:03:43.500> I'm<00:03:43.650> set<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.010> local

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
basically if you notice I'm set in local

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.860 
basically if you notice I'm set in local
access<00:03:44.640> mode<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.120> order<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.390> change<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
access mode so in order to change that I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.650 
access mode so in order to change that I
have<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.170> press<00:03:46.410> ryy<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.490> then<00:03:48.150> rotate<00:03:48.540> it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
have to press ryy and then rotate it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.030 
have to press ryy and then rotate it
like<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.170> I'm<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.380> gonna<00:03:49.470> rotate<00:03:49.770> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
like this and I'm just gonna rotate it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.160 
like this and I'm just gonna rotate it
so<00:03:50.250> right<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.330> location<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
so right at that location the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.310 
so right at that location the
approximate<00:03:52.740> it's<00:03:53.220> approximately<00:03:53.970> aligned

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.200 

that<00:03:58.320> lines<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:59.190> lines<00:03:59.400> pretty<00:03:59.640> good<00:03:59.910> he's

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
that lines that lines pretty good he's

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.020 
that lines that lines pretty good he's
pretty<00:04:01.080> aligned<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.710> for<00:04:02.520> there<00:04:02.670> well

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
pretty aligned with that for there well

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.340 
pretty aligned with that for there well
it's<00:04:03.120> good<00:04:03.270> enough<00:04:03.300> for<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.690> demonstration

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
it's good enough for the demonstration

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.040 
it's good enough for the demonstration
and<00:04:04.910> then<00:04:07.640> when<00:04:08.640> we<00:04:08.760> brought<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.240> it

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
and then when we brought it then it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.930 
and then when we brought it then it
should<00:04:10.350> actually<00:04:10.530> be<00:04:10.740> tangent<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.910> curve

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
should actually be tangent to the curve

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.530 
should actually be tangent to the curve
of<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.420> whole<00:04:12.540> way<00:04:13.130> let's<00:04:14.130> see

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.140 

there<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.500> go<00:04:18.680> all<00:04:18.920> right<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.610> then<00:04:20.030> of

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
there you go all right and then of

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.120 
there you go all right and then of
course<00:04:20.210> if<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.570> wanted<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.930> change<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:21.620> it
