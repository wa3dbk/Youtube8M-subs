00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 hello everyone so all tried to be done 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.520
 a little cost because 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.520
 that today I am really not 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.820
 suck but really not so I 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.050
 started with honor to put 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.050
 varnish on a part of the same angle and the 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:55.920
 next I put the top coat so on this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:58.339
 angle there and I'm going sprinkled it can 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.339
 to be super 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.339
 with little glitters like that and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.339
 with powder 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.420
 like that 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 so I'll let it dry before I 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:30.220
 flattened well will be from one I will do what 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.360
 I'm going to do this nail by nail 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:39.710
 knowing that right now my nails are 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:41.660
 completely but yes so if it's 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.490
 once they've all broken it's a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.490
 nameless horror 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.780
 in fact I'm going to try I'm trying to 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.999
 put straw in the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.109
 delimitation I made because 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.369
 my job is not he is not 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.929
 extraordinary she is not great 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.390
 missing never betrayed are never right 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.890
 it annoys me so we try to camouflage 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.100
 all with good paillade like 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100
 it is necessary 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.600
 that's it and so I 'm going to continue on 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.730
 other languages 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.800
 so once I finish it gives 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
 so I let it dry well 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.060
 cost once it will be finished I 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.520
 give a little brushstroke 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 fan on so could resume 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.160
 I made my costs 2 419 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.650
 oak piot he is superb he is super 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.860
 beautiful one so with the little one in my 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 country in presentation of chip in base 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 used the base of anne piot the top 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.780
 low coat and the ultra chain top of home 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.570
 a girl or a small step her fan 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.650
 for bayat 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.400
 so that's small glitters 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.510
 so we can relativize x so that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.780
 that's the rub it's what I had 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.780
 call they make a millimeter 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.120
 then that's the glitter in 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.370
 they are in the party not this talent 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.150
 this one is small glitter 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.050
 pale roses with chopsticks a little 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 little and make a little green iridescent green 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.170
 So here I am, I will wait again 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.400
 a little bit because it's already ok 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.480
 so once it's dry 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.040
 we are going to dust all the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.030
 glitter that stays and that are not 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030
 remained stuck in the top coat 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.600
 but in general there is a good part 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.870
 who will stick so it's pretty good 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.870
 so here we go 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.819
 with I will add I added a 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.879
 little water shifts with something really 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.110
 super discreet added in a corner the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.909
 speed we avoid that it be 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.909
 really too safe too much 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.380
 So here you go, like blah blah, I 'm kidnapped 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.890
 the lot that remains I'm sorry that if 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.890
 you wish 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:02.310
 that's hockey so I kept them 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:13.650
 jeans dry on the spot and then and then and 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:18.890
 then I fight to finish I 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.890
 crazy puts them in a shot you cost 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 moustoir 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.450
 it's just a pity after house does 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.850
 not necessarily the same form of a 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.710
 the same length but hey that gives you 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.010
 already an idea of ​​what we can do 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.360
 with a mix of glitter 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.100
 which is very convenient 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.240
 when we have no mix at all 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.820
 glitter that we will not necessarily 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.860
 invest in the bling bling mix 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.960
 end when we do not use them as 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.040
 professional enough regularly and that 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.639
 you want to do or there small mix 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.220
 glitter 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.520
 you can buy small sachets 1 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.220
 euro you put them in small 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.980
 capsules like that and then you do 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:27.450
 a small collection not very expensive so 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:28.280
 that's what it gives its fans to 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.070
 glitters are still relatively 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.410
 went to the shine and brightness level 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.120
 it's still worth bling bling 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:43.830
 bling bling mix Cheyenne FEW 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:50.550
 so that's it for this little decoration 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:52.680
 do not want to do the pool so the 419 then 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.360
