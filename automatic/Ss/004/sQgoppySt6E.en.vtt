the next one is compass

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.310 
the next one is compass
compiz<00:02:16.190> does<00:02:16.460> make<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.850> smaller<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.990> probably

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
have to use a bigger program to make it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.050 
have to use a bigger program to make it
wider<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.830> other<00:02:21.950> that's<00:02:22.190> pretty<00:02:22.580> good<00:02:22.760> and
