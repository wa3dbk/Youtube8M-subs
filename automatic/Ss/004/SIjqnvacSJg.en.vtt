when<00:03:16.980> he's<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> type<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.489> form<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.540> I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
when he's in a type of form so like I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.930 
when he's in a type of form so like I
said<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:19.079> has<00:03:19.319> its<00:03:19.680> weaknesses<00:03:20.190> don't<00:03:20.669> get<00:03:20.819> me

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
said it has its weaknesses don't get me

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.819 
said it has its weaknesses don't get me
wrong<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.329> would<00:03:21.419> love<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> see<00:03:22.169> Aaron<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.739> know

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
wrong I would love to see Aaron you know

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.009 
wrong I would love to see Aaron you know
take<00:03:23.069> out<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> tightener<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.660> 3d

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
take out a tightener to with the 3d

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.289 
take out a tightener to with the 3d
maneuver<00:03:25.769> gear<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.579> not<00:03:26.730> all<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.090> time

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
maneuver gear but just not all the time

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.349 
maneuver gear but just not all the time
because<00:03:27.599> then<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.230> will<00:03:28.379> seem<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.650> mikasa

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
because then it will seem like mikasa

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.390 
because then it will seem like mikasa
Aaron<00:03:30.359> and<00:03:30.599> Levi<00:03:30.989> are<00:03:31.230> all<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.859> brother<00:03:32.160> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
sister like there's all these three

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.390 
sister like there's all these three
badass<00:03:34.199> motherfuckers<00:03:34.739> even<00:03:35.190> though<00:03:35.250> they

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
badass motherfuckers even though they

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670 
badass motherfuckers even though they
already<00:03:35.730> are<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.060> their<00:03:36.389> own<00:03:36.510> way<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.139> like

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
already are in their own way I like

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.800 
already are in their own way I like
Aaron's<00:03:38.250> method<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:38.910> like<00:03:39.150> how<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.419> story

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
Aaron's method and I like how the story

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.479 
Aaron's method and I like how the story
is<00:03:39.930> going<00:03:40.139> I<00:03:40.470> would<00:03:40.709> just<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.040> see<00:03:41.220> him<00:03:41.370> at

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
is going I would just like to see him at

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.159 
is going I would just like to see him at
least<00:03:41.730> kill<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.299> or<00:03:42.329> two<00:03:42.569> because<00:03:42.780> he<00:03:43.019> went

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
least kill one or two because he went

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.689 
least kill one or two because he went
through<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.410> same<00:03:43.680> training<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.220> Mikasa

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
through the same training that Mikasa

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.059 
through the same training that Mikasa
and<00:03:45.030> every<00:03:45.419> other<00:03:45.449> badass<00:03:46.199> did<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.949> he

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
and every other badass did so he

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.009 
and every other badass did so he
deserves<00:03:47.430> at<00:03:47.790> least<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:48.150> few<00:03:48.329> kids<00:03:48.569> like<00:03:48.810> that

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
deserves at least a few kids like that

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.839 
deserves at least a few kids like that
but<00:03:49.410> that's<00:03:49.560> not<00:03:49.709> really<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.980> problem<00:03:50.069> with<00:03:50.699> him

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
but that's not really a problem with him

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.460 
but that's not really a problem with him
being<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.299> main<00:03:51.690> character<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.290> with<00:03:52.379> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
being a main character and with the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.979 
being a main character and with the
power<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.919> he<00:03:53.099> has<00:03:53.129> he<00:03:53.970> has<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.480> secrets<00:03:54.900> to

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
power that he has he has the secrets to

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.750 
power that he has he has the secrets to
the<00:03:55.169> Titans<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.680> his<00:03:55.980> basement<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.609> his

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the Titans in his basement that his

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.089 
the Titans in his basement that his
father<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.599> know<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.930> blatantly<00:03:58.409> just<00:03:58.500> shrimp

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
father you know so blatantly just shrimp

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.710 
father you know so blatantly just shrimp
told<00:03:59.400> him<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.699> hey<00:03:59.849> I<00:03:59.879> have<00:04:00.180> secrets<00:04:00.480> about

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
told him that hey I have secrets about

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.110 
told him that hey I have secrets about
Titus<00:04:01.109> if<00:04:01.230> I'm<00:04:01.319> off<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.709> basement<00:04:02.099> so<00:04:02.609> with

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
Titus if I'm off of the basement so with

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.849 
Titus if I'm off of the basement so with
that<00:04:03.239> being<00:04:03.449> said<00:04:03.599> he's<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.680> main<00:04:04.829> character

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
that being said he's the main character

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.619 
that being said he's the main character
in<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.400> aspect<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:05.970> he<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.359> doesn't<00:04:06.599> have

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
in that aspect so he really doesn't have

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.289 
in that aspect so he really doesn't have
to<00:04:06.840> kill<00:04:07.079> Titans<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:08.250> way<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:08.849> Aaron<00:04:09.150> gets

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
to kill Titans in that way so Aaron gets

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.089 
to kill Titans in that way so Aaron gets
a<00:04:09.359> pass<00:04:09.569> for<00:04:09.900> me<00:04:10.079> you<00:04:10.500> know<00:04:10.530> he<00:04:10.709> doesn't<00:04:10.859> even

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
a pass for me you know he doesn't even

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.729 
a pass for me you know he doesn't even
have<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.729> kill<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> Titan<00:04:12.540> know<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.349> regular

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
have to kill a Titan know the regular

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.619 
have to kill a Titan know the regular
way<00:04:13.889> ever<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.819> series<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.359> wouldn't

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
way ever in the series and I wouldn't

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.509 
way ever in the series and I wouldn't
complain<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.260> would<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.769> see<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.190> would<00:04:17.400> be

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
complain I would like to see it would be

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.699 
complain I would like to see it would be
a<00:04:17.549> nice<00:04:17.760> throw<00:04:18.060> in<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:18.630> he<00:04:18.750> never<00:04:19.079> has<00:04:19.409> to

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
a nice throw in but he never has to

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.349 
a nice throw in but he never has to
because<00:04:20.250> think<00:04:20.489> about<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.849> if<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:20.969> were<00:04:21.209> able

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
because think about it if you were able

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.240 
because think about it if you were able
to<00:04:21.659> transfer

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
to transfer

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.370 
to transfer
arm<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.850> one<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.180> those<00:04:23.330> things<00:04:23.720> about<00:04:24.170> their

size and whoop their ass like that once

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.270 
size and whoop their ass like that once
you<00:04:26.630> grab<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:26.930> do<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.320> then<00:04:27.740> stay<00:04:28.040> human

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
you grab you do that then stay human

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880 
you grab you do that then stay human
size<00:04:28.670> and<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.630> know<00:04:29.720> potentially<00:04:30.410> get

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
size and you know potentially get

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.950 
size and you know potentially get
chomped<00:04:31.250> aaron<00:04:31.760> has<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.970> better<00:04:32.360> chance<00:04:32.480> of

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
chomped aaron has a better chance of

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.830 
chomped aaron has a better chance of
survival<00:04:33.590> doing<00:04:34.190> things<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.640> way<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.540> can

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
survival doing things that way so can

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.780 
survival doing things that way so can
you<00:04:35.870> really<00:04:36.260> blame<00:04:36.560> him<00:04:36.950> for<00:04:37.010> going<00:04:37.490> that

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
you really blame him for going that

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.670 
you really blame him for going that
route<00:04:38.030> most<00:04:38.420> of<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.720> time<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> can

route most of the time now I can

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.040 
route most of the time now I can
