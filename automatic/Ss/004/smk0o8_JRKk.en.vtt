00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this was my first historical why a audio

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.590 
this was my first historical why a audio
book<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.550> was<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> new<00:00:41.850> experience<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.450> me

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

I'm<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.170> used<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.710> though<00:00:44.100> we're

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

pacing<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.510> definitely<00:00:45.660> feel<00:00:46.050> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
pacing and you can definitely feel that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.290 
pacing and you can definitely feel that
when<00:00:46.440> you're<00:00:46.590> listening<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:47.640> audio<00:00:48.239> book

such<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.930> between<00:00:49.170> shades<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.770> grey<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.309> did

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
such as between shades of grey I did

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900 
such as between shades of grey I did
like<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> narration<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> most<00:00:52.620> part<00:00:53.010> but

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
like the narration for the most part but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.709 
like the narration for the most part but
I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.110> weird<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.920> listen<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719

I think it was weird to listen to a
historical<00:00:57.719> audio<00:00:58.219> because<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.520> Linda<00:00:59.850> tells

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
historical audio because as Linda tells

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.160 
historical audio because as Linda tells
a<00:01:00.270> story<00:01:00.649> she<00:01:01.649> sometimes<00:01:02.129> jumps<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.870> time

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
a story she sometimes jumps back in time

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.670 
a story she sometimes jumps back in time
and<00:01:04.619> talks<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.309> her<00:01:06.119> memories<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.650> good

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this book is it touches upon a subject

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.730 
this book is it touches upon a subject
that<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.850> had<00:02:00.210> no<00:02:00.570> previous<00:02:01.079> knowledge<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.590> like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that I had no previous knowledge of like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
that I had no previous knowledge of like
I<00:02:01.890> had<00:02:02.219> no<00:02:02.369> idea<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.180> part<00:02:03.600> of

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
I had no idea that there's this part of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.170 
I had no idea that there's this part of
history<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.799> hear<00:02:05.100> World<00:02:05.399> War<00:02:05.610> two<00:02:05.939> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
think of Hitler and the Holocaust but

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.660 
think of Hitler and the Holocaust but
you<00:02:08.970> never<00:02:09.149> really<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.810> Stalin<00:02:10.319> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
you never really think of Stalin and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.530 
you never really think of Stalin and
thousands<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.879> Lithuanians<00:02:12.810> who<00:02:13.140> are<00:02:13.260> just

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.599

as<00:02:16.599> for<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> main<00:02:17.110> character<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.650> really<00:02:17.769> liked

I wish I could see it there's only so

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.259 
I wish I could see it there's only so
much<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.930> descriptions<00:02:25.930> could<00:02:26.920> do<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:28.030> I

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
much that descriptions could do and I

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.399 
much that descriptions could do and I
would<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.510> liked<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.810> see<00:02:28.989> some<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.290> her

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
would have liked to see some of her

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.119 
would have liked to see some of her
drawings

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
drawings

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.729 
drawings
I<00:02:30.250> liked<00:02:31.060> hearing<00:02:31.540> her<00:02:31.810> struggles<00:02:32.260> because<00:02:32.470> as

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
I liked hearing her struggles because as

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.559 
I liked hearing her struggles because as
a<00:02:32.769> capture<00:02:33.430> she's<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:34.390> rebellious<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:36.569> she

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
a capture she's very rebellious and she

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.990 
a capture she's very rebellious and she
never<00:02:37.840> really<00:02:37.989> lost<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.709> spirit<00:02:39.340> her

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
never really lost that spirit her

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.479 
never really lost that spirit her
situation<00:02:40.629> you<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.319> see<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.620> as<00:02:41.709> hopeless<00:02:42.159> but

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
situation you can see it as hopeless but

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.119 
situation you can see it as hopeless but
no<00:02:43.000> matter<00:02:43.180> what<00:02:43.540> she<00:02:43.719> persevered<00:02:44.379> there<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.099> a

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
no matter what she persevered there is a

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.190 
no matter what she persevered there is a
little<00:02:45.400> bit<00:02:45.639> of<00:02:45.879> romance<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:46.599> between<00:02:46.959> shades

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
little bit of romance in between shades

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.830 
little bit of romance in between shades
of<00:02:47.349> grey<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.480> setting

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
of grey but because of the setting

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.539 
of grey but because of the setting
because<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.590> situation<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.459> not

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
because of the situation it's not

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.770 
because of the situation it's not
exactly<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.389> ideal<00:02:52.419> place<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.379> fall<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.040> love

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
exactly the ideal place to fall in love

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.699 
exactly the ideal place to fall in love
lastly<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> thought<00:02:56.139> the<00:02:56.230> ending<00:02:56.439> was<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.620> bit

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
lastly I thought the ending was a bit

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.490 
lastly I thought the ending was a bit
anti-climatic<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:58.239> guess<00:02:58.659> I<00:02:58.780> was<00:02:58.900> comparing<00:02:59.379> it

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
anti-climatic I guess I was comparing it

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.740 
anti-climatic I guess I was comparing it
to<00:02:59.530> some<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.609> books<00:03:00.970> I've<00:03:01.150> read<00:03:01.299> about<00:03:01.540> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
to some of the books I've read about the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.659 
to some of the books I've read about the
Holocaust<00:03:02.200> where<00:03:02.530> oh<00:03:02.739> my<00:03:03.159> gosh<00:03:03.310> they're

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
Holocaust where oh my gosh they're

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.270 
Holocaust where oh my gosh they're
getting<00:03:03.939> rescued<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.900> finally<00:03:05.590> it's<00:03:05.859> great

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
getting rescued and finally it's great

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.509 
getting rescued and finally it's great
seed<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.540> happy<00:03:08.079> ending<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:09.129> in

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
seed and have a happy ending but in

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.949 
seed and have a happy ending but in
between<00:03:09.819> she's<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.269> great<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.629> don't

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
between she's of great you don't

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.170 
between she's of great you don't
actually<00:03:11.560> get<00:03:11.919> that<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.489> suddenly<00:03:12.639> cuts

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
actually get that it just suddenly cuts

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.500 
actually get that it just suddenly cuts
off<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:14.109> then<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.379> have<00:03:14.470> an<00:03:14.590> epilogue<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:16.269> it

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
off and then you have an epilogue so it

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.869 
off and then you have an epilogue so it
was<00:03:16.629> a<00:03:16.659> little<00:03:16.870> off-putting<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.609> don't

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
was a little off-putting because I don't

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.719 
was a little off-putting because I don't
know<00:03:19.030> how<00:03:19.359> they<00:03:20.079> got<00:03:20.290> from<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.310> end<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.609> the

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:21.729 
know how they got from the end of the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.509 
know how they got from the end of the
book<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.199> epilogue<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.949> it<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.310> just

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
book to the epilogue and it kind of just

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.899 
book to the epilogue and it kind of just
jumped<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:26.440> at<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.859> same<00:03:27.099> time<00:03:27.459> I<00:03:27.519> thought

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
jumped but at the same time I thought

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.210 
jumped but at the same time I thought
the<00:03:28.030> epilogue<00:03:28.510> was<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.109> little<00:03:29.620> satisfying

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
the epilogue was a little satisfying

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.099 
the epilogue was a little satisfying
because<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.269> know<00:03:31.449> what<00:03:31.599> happens<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
because you do know what happens to the

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.550 
because you do know what happens to the
characters<00:03:32.379> even<00:03:33.099> if<00:03:33.370> it's<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.269> way<00:03:34.989> way

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
characters even if it's that way way

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.879 
characters even if it's that way way
further<00:03:36.099> into<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.819> future<00:03:37.620> overall<00:03:38.620> I

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
further into the future overall I

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.969 
further into the future overall I
enjoyed<00:03:39.510> between<00:03:40.510> shades<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.930> grey<00:03:41.109> by<00:03:41.470> Ruud

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:41.979 
enjoyed between shades of grey by Ruud

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.460 
enjoyed between shades of grey by Ruud
Receptus<00:03:42.760> because<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.690> learned<00:03:44.169> something<00:03:44.349> new

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
Receptus because I learned something new

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.559 
Receptus because I learned something new

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
and that's one thing that I do like

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
about historical why a in general

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.229 
about historical why a in general
because<00:03:50.129> there<00:03:51.129> are<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:51.549> many<00:03:51.579> parts<00:03:52.150> of

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239
