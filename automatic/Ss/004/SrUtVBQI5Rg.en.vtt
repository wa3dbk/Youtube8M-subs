00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.500
 I do not know if the normal version also comes 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.409

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.929
 comment here project x very cool a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 choice of colors 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:55.590
 the motorcycle romance evening refuse a 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.470
 literary edition the original film of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.200
 1968 I originally say that he had two 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.690
 trim and will get a new not yet 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.690
 has a debut date so far 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 this is the origin of the zombies that we 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.320
 we started today in the series doc dead film 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.950
 resident evil zumbilandia world war 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.610
 z 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.730
 all this would be nothing if not 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 the night of the living dead existed 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.750
 The book is by the Russian author John who also 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.580
 Wanted to have the movie together with George 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.130
 romero in the introduction he tells how it was 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.810
 the process of creating the film that is a 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.020
 treasure for any fan 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.970
 I assure you the story of the book is fine. 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.660
 detailed much more than the clear film 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.330
 because the other had more time to 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.860
 develop the characters more time and 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.170
 freedom 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.820
 for example in the movie that I do not 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.150
 I contented with the death of the first 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:05.270
 character already with book I confess that 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 I felt a little compassion for him in the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.740
 from history this happens in 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.260
 other characters too 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.640
 It does not stop there 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 good this book is a drawing from 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.450
 half we got us back from the dead 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.050
 is not that comedy movie 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.300
 have 1985 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.209
 in addition the script was also entered 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.940
 by a fast but the continuation 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.370
 of previous history and did not have a 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.530
 film version of show 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.530
 you more people accompanying the edition 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:52.489
 It was really cool this very capricious option. 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:57.800
 like all the books on the dark side of 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:01.280
 health mt said chan has 320 pages cover 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.860
 and the images that show you 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.590
 I find it very beautiful they are more clever 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.370
 so this is very recommended people 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.880
 book the night of the living dead and back 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.930
 of the living dead 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.970
 From the publisher dark side bus I hope 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.600
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.990
 leaving a video gate comment is 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.730
 so our channel receives new videos 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.460
 posteriorly 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.460
 And that's a big hug, bye, bye.
