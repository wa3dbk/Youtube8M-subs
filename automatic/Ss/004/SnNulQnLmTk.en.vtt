 hello everyone with you earring and today we 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:20.380
 let's get the fire out of the empty lighter 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.169
 Well, to her something to light 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:28.359
 we will need to remove this one 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:34.420
 the vest here we have u10 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.540

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.390
 but for this I will use the usual 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:50.229
 napkin that's such a post to set fire to it 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.059
 we fail and so now 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.610

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.670
 Well, and then there will put it here, my 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.280
 a little we touch silicon but for that 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.089
 we are very slowly turning the wheel 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.439
 lighters 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.440

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.150

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.080
