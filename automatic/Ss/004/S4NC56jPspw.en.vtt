00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
are not familiar with the filbert it's

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.089 
are not familiar with the filbert it's
flat<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.849> like<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> shader<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.559> edges

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
flat just like a shader but the edges

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.720 
flat just like a shader but the edges
are<00:00:14.340> curved<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:14.969> each<00:00:15.150> side<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.960> tip<00:00:16.730> it's

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
are curved on each side of the tip it's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.570 
are curved on each side of the tip it's

you<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.519> few<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:25.310> I'm<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.519> load

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you just a few of them I'm going to load

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
you just a few of them I'm going to load
it<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.420> usually<00:00:27.810> load<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.289> both

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it up and I usually load it on both

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.380 
it up and I usually load it on both
sides<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.640> see<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> don't<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sides and you can see I don't have a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
sides and you can see I don't have a
heavy<00:00:30.750> amount<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.199> paint<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.279> not

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
fat and Bowlby at the ends you want to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
fat and Bowlby at the ends you want to
keep<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.309> shape<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> brush<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.390> don't

keep the shape of the brush you don't

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.290 
keep the shape of the brush you don't
want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> lose<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:36.960> nice<00:00:37.380> round<00:00:37.739> tip<00:00:38.149> one<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
want to lose that nice round tip one of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
want to lose that nice round tip one of
the<00:00:39.390> things<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.230> painters<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.100> been

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the things that that painters have been

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.060 
the things that that painters have been
using<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> filbert<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.290> many<00:00:43.410> years<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
using the filbert for for many years is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180 
using the filbert for for many years is
creating<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> simple<00:00:45.300> leaf<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:46.980> you've

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
creating a simple leaf and if you've

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.369 
creating a simple leaf and if you've
ever<00:00:47.370> wondered<00:00:47.610> how<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.360> done<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.989> read

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ever wondered how this is done and read

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
ever wondered how this is done and read
instructions<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> quarter<00:00:50.640> turn<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
instructions on the quarter turn and the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
instructions on the quarter turn and the
lift<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> pull<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.710> very<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.190> simple

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
lift and the pull it's very very simple

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
lift and the pull it's very very simple
you'd<00:00:54.239> lay<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> down<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.079> lay<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> down

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you'd lay it down and as you lay it down

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.900 
you'd lay it down and as you lay it down
it's<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> create<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> Halfmoon

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it's going to create like a Halfmoon

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.689 
it's going to create like a Halfmoon
base<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.770> pull<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
base as you pull it out you're going to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.260 
base as you pull it out you're going to
lift<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.670> press<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.059> as

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
lift it up on a point and press and as

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
lift it up on a point and press and as
you<00:01:03.420> lift<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.840> see<00:01:04.260> how<00:01:04.470> nice<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.189> leaf

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you lift it up see how nice of a leaf

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
you lift it up see how nice of a leaf
that<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.380> very<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.680> simple<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.280> create<00:01:09.470> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
that is very very simple to create and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
that is very very simple to create and
if<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.189> starts<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> drag<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
if it starts to drag like that and you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
if it starts to drag like that and you
get<00:01:12.689> rough<00:01:12.930> edges<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:14.130> running<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
get rough edges you're running out of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
get rough edges you're running out of
water<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.720> simply<00:01:16.020> need<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.320> reload

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
water so you just simply need to reload

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.090 
water so you just simply need to reload
again<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.990> same<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.170> before<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.920> going

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
again and same as before I'm not going

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
again and same as before I'm not going
to<00:01:20.159> fatten<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.640> brush<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.270> paint<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to fatten my brush up with paint the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.870 
to fatten my brush up with paint the
bristles<00:01:22.650> are<00:01:22.799> nice<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.280> long<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> they<00:01:23.729> can

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bristles are nice and long and they can

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.520 
bristles are nice and long and they can
hold<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> fairly<00:01:24.890> amount<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.979> paint<00:01:26.310> without

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
hold a fairly amount of paint without

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.080 
hold a fairly amount of paint without
overloading<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.189> don't<00:01:29.369> want<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> ridges

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
overloading you don't want the ridges

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.800 
overloading you don't want the ridges
around<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> edges<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.549> brush<00:01:32.659> see<00:01:33.659> how

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
around the edges of your brush see how

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
around the edges of your brush see how
simple<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.420> I'm<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.479> doing<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
simple that is and I'm just doing a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.700 
simple that is and I'm just doing a
quarter<00:01:37.380> turn<00:01:37.939> a<00:01:38.939> quarter<00:01:39.540> turn<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.170> pulling

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
quarter turn a quarter turn and pulling

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620 
quarter turn a quarter turn and pulling
up<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.340> point<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> creates<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
up on the point and that creates that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.670 
up on the point and that creates that
point<00:01:43.490> likewise<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> create<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
point likewise if you want to create a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
point likewise if you want to create a
comma<00:01:47.460> stroke<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> same<00:01:51.689> thing

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
comma stroke you can do the same thing

with a a flap I'd like to also use my
filbert<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.220> since<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.579> have<00:03:19.760> these

nice<00:03:20.299> little<00:03:20.510> rounded<00:03:20.930> points<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:22.400> can

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
nice little rounded points you can

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.850 
nice little rounded points you can
create<00:03:24.670> little<00:03:25.670> Daisy<00:03:25.910> shapes<00:03:26.510> just<00:03:26.860> going

create little Daisy shapes just going

create little Daisy shapes just going
around<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:34.010> probably<00:03:34.730> going<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.940> work<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
around and it's probably going to work a

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.300 
around and it's probably going to work a
little<00:03:35.329> easier<00:03:35.570> if<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:36.019> have<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.890> pattern<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
little easier if you have a pattern that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.890 
little easier if you have a pattern that
you're<00:03:37.519> going<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.730> follow<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.299> usually<00:03:38.690> like<00:03:38.870> to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
you're going to follow I usually like to

petals on a flower odd numbers seem to

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.620 
petals on a flower odd numbers seem to
be<00:03:44.359> just<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.840> little<00:03:44.870> more<00:03:45.230> aesthetic<00:03:46.630> pleasing

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
be just a little more aesthetic pleasing

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.970 
be just a little more aesthetic pleasing
to<00:03:47.720> look<00:03:47.750> at<00:03:50.769> there<00:03:51.769> we<00:03:51.980> go

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
to look at there we go

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.199 
to look at there we go
always<00:03:54.980> remember<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.519> can<00:03:55.670> turn<00:03:55.820> your<00:03:56.000> piece

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
always remember you can turn your piece

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.910 
always remember you can turn your piece
around<00:03:56.630> if<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.870> can't<00:03:57.109> quite<00:03:57.350> get<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.799> it

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
around if you can't quite get to it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.710 
around if you can't quite get to it
easily<00:03:59.410> that's<00:04:00.410> why<00:04:00.769> we<00:04:01.299> move<00:04:02.299> things<00:04:02.570> around

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
easily that's why we move things around

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.209 
easily that's why we move things around
to<00:04:02.959> make<00:04:02.989> it<00:04:03.290> easier

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:17.800 

you<00:04:10.219> can<00:04:10.370> pull<00:04:10.609> that<00:04:10.640> down<00:04:16.419> now<00:04:17.419> if<00:04:17.539> you<00:04:17.630> want

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
you can pull that down now if you want

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.550 
you can pull that down now if you want
smaller<00:04:18.169> petals<00:04:18.769> or<00:04:19.100> leaves<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.990> just<00:04:24.020> drop

smaller petals or leaves you just drop

smaller petals or leaves you just drop
down<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.009> smaller<00:04:25.370> filbert<00:04:27.460> see<00:04:28.460> how<00:04:28.580> you

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
down to a smaller filbert see how you

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
can do a lot of different designs with

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.040 
can do a lot of different designs with
the<00:04:31.220> filbert<00:04:32.440> need<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.560> give<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.949> try<00:04:35.050> test

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the filbert need to give it a try test

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.980 
the filbert need to give it a try test
it<00:04:36.229> out<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.830> one<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> number<00:04:37.789> six<00:04:38.150> like<00:04:38.960> I

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
it out this one is a number six like I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.080 
it out this one is a number six like I
said<00:04:39.289> if<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.560> need<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.979> go<00:04:40.130> smaller<00:04:40.550> number

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
said if you need to go smaller number

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.969 
said if you need to go smaller number
fours<00:04:41.360> are<00:04:41.630> great<00:04:41.870> for<00:04:42.110> smaller<00:04:42.380> projects

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
fours are great for smaller projects

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.999 
fours are great for smaller projects
that<00:04:43.099> even<00:04:43.340> go<00:04:43.490> down<00:04:44.080> number<00:04:45.080> twos<00:04:45.320> for

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
that even go down number twos for

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.060 
that even go down number twos for
teeny-tiny<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.900> just<00:04:48.110> keeps<00:04:48.349> going<00:04:48.560> up<00:04:48.860> in

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
teeny-tiny and it just keeps going up in

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.510 
teeny-tiny and it just keeps going up in
size<00:04:49.599> this<00:04:50.599> one<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:51.080> kind<00:04:51.830> of<00:04:51.889> a<00:04:51.979> middle<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
size this one is kind of a middle of the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.339 
size this one is kind of a middle of the
range<00:04:53.349> size<00:04:54.349> and<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:56.449> more<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.780> play<00:04:56.960> with<00:04:56.990> it
