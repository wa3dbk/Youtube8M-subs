00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.259
 sugar is one of the most products 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.030
 used in our day to day but we know 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.059
 the problems that bring its high 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 consumption is more have you ever tried 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.279
 stop consuming it and could not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.189
 reason is that a person who consumes 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 food with a high sugar index 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.730
 he experienced the feeling of ecstasy 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.430
 similar to those who use drugs 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 this produces a dependence on these 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.539
 Foods that cause very serious 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.030
 health problems sugar is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.210
 highly addictive the second that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 stimulates insulin and insulin 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.460
 when it is in excess it can be 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.719
 highly damaging to the body 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 because in fat form 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.270
 note that maÃ±aneros them 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.360
 We detail the problems caused by the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:00.150
 excess in the consumption of sugar as 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.890
 affect children pay attention to 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.260
 this investigation carried out by the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 doctor doris rap from the university of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.880
 new york here we can see a child 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 that behaves well and stays 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 quiet but everything changes when you give 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 eat 6 lumps of sugar now look at your 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.930
 attitude 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 the child gets aggressive crafty cries and 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.420
 it remains very restless can produce 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.430
 in children hyperactivity that is very 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 fashionable then many children eat 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.130
 a lot of sugar is tremendously 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.290
 hyperactive you can sing what I'm 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.180
 using with medicines and sometimes 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.410
 simply remove sugar and 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 children can greatly increase their capacity 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.659
 concentration 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.659
 it is claimed that sugar is a great 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.030
 disqualifying mainly affecting 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.250
 to the bones and the teeth this factor 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.520
 it becomes even more acute when consumed 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.800
 Cakes or cakes because this occurs 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.110
 because our organism suppresses the 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.110
 calcium deficiency extracting those from 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 other parts 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.000
 following with the teeth the consumption of 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.820
 sweets with a high concentration of sugar 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.160
 also causes cavities the reason is that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.080
 these products because of their great acidity 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.080
 destroy the tooth enamel 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 knowing that sugars cause 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.130
 obesity and diabetes but this is not all 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 since this product also distorts 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.390
 the hormones and force the glands to 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.940
 work even more this affects the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.400
 sodium regulation is potassium the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.069
 blood pressure the adrenaline and the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 Steroid secretion from users with 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.569
 this only sugar makes you fat 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.550
 that began to increase fats that are 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.440
 very poor quality and in the long run too 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.010
 we are having a tremendous percentage 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.519
 of diabetics produced by the excess of 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.590
 sugar consumption a lot of eye with what 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.570
 following since studies assure that 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.090
 sugar increases the risk of contracting 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.459
 cancer since it decreases minerals 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.800
 of the body making the enzymes not 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.650
 are so effective in their functions as 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.420
 protection this in turn increases the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.090
 presence of the so-called radicals 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.540
 free that can lead to mutations 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.750
 cancer cells in miches or 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.880
 sugar and it 's very bad because it produces 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.280
 made stick cancer and sugar 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.410
 the hand to the cancer cells them 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.880
 love sugar then because you 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 for people with cancer better to eat 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.060
 sugar I was up to that level can be 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.150
 bad 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.370
 It seems quite harmful to you, we tell you 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.380
 that is not all because the sugar also 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.780
 produces allergies weakens the system 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.810
 immunological causes diseases 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.910
 chronicles and even their substitutes are 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.030
 just as processed and can reach 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.640
 be more harmful than the same sugar 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.530
 stevia I would say that it is far the best 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.720
 of the Quran because stevia is a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.760
 plant that actually regulates the levels 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.590
 of blood sugar does not make you want 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.020
 to eat more sugar to the people as if 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.240
 can happen with aspartame or with him 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.220
 he makes his flame and all these things that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.760
 they put juices and jellies 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760
 etc 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.880
 do not say we do not tell you the highs 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.860
 sugar levels cause us serious 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.100
 diseases that would be taking us away 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.910
 the little life and you will continue 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.910
 consuming the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 a pause
