the list of principle and I day can be

the list of principle and I day can be
used<00:01:14.350> in<00:01:14.530> many<00:01:15.159> different<00:01:15.430> situations<00:01:15.940> they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
used in many different situations they

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.350 
used in many different situations they
wanted<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.170> have<00:01:17.290> any<00:01:17.920> sort<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.280> menu<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.240> you

access<00:01:19.720> via<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.080> chat<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.619> I'm<00:01:21.040> trying<00:01:21.310> to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
access via the chat and I'm trying to

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.680 
access via the chat and I'm trying to
make<00:01:21.580> this<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:21.940> soon<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.210> flexible<00:01:22.600> as

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
make this as soon as flexible as

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.570 
make this as soon as flexible as
possible<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.590> before<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.920> go<00:01:24.070> ahead<00:01:24.280> in<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
possible so before you go ahead in the

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.950 
possible so before you go ahead in the
comments<00:01:25.030> just<00:01:25.149> have<00:01:25.330> a<00:01:25.360> think<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:25.720> the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
comments just have a think about the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.450 
comments just have a think about the
difference<00:01:26.080> or<00:01:26.409> possibilities<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.340> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
difference or possibilities that the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.399 
difference or possibilities that the
system<00:01:27.820> i'm<00:01:27.940> presenting<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.720> be<00:01:28.840> useful

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
system i'm presenting can be useful

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.859 
system i'm presenting can be useful
because<00:01:29.920> it<00:01:30.310> may<00:01:30.610> not<00:01:30.880> just<00:01:30.940> be<00:01:31.210> applying<00:01:31.600> to

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
because it may not just be applying to

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.380 
because it may not just be applying to
what<00:01:32.020> i'm<00:01:32.140> actually<00:01:32.259> showing<00:01:32.940> anyway<00:01:33.940> as<00:01:34.149> you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
what i'm actually showing anyway as you

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.060 
what i'm actually showing anyway as you
can<00:01:34.450> see<00:01:34.659> here<00:01:34.930> everything<00:01:35.590> that's<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.860> little

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
can see here everything that's a little

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.100 
can see here everything that's a little
daunting<00:01:36.280> but<00:01:36.880> fear<00:01:37.149> not<00:01:37.179> and<00:01:37.539> this<00:01:37.810> way<00:01:38.020> i'm

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
daunting but fear not and this way i'm

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
daunting but fear not and this way i'm
going<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.350> run<00:01:38.500> through<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.800> basic

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
going to run through the basic

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.590 
going to run through the basic
principles<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.759> gerry<00:01:39.970> how<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.240> all<00:01:40.360> works

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
principles and gerry how it all works

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.630 
principles and gerry how it all works
however<00:01:41.410> i<00:01:41.440> don't<00:01:41.740> expect<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.160> all<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.310> follow

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
however i don't expect you all to follow

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.430 
however i don't expect you all to follow
on<00:01:42.970> because<00:01:43.600> i'm<00:01:43.720> actually<00:01:43.840> working<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.350> a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
on because i'm actually working on a

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.700 
on because i'm actually working on a
simplifying<00:01:45.660> process<00:01:46.660> that<00:01:47.259> will<00:01:47.470> be

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
simplifying process that will be

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.710 
simplifying process that will be
perfectly<00:01:48.130> modulus<00:01:48.610> so<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.179> me<00:01:49.390> another

perfectly modulus so that me another

filter to automate it all for you anyway
i<00:01:54.970> could<00:01:55.060> talk<00:01:55.330> about<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.630> all<00:01:55.690> day<00:01:55.869> or<00:01:56.350> we

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
i could talk about that all day or we

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.190 
i could talk about that all day or we
can<00:01:56.830> get<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.220> explain<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.869> system

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
can get on to explain this in the system

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.510 
can get on to explain this in the system
we<00:01:59.289> pretty<00:01:59.500> much<00:01:59.560> used<00:01:59.950> everything<00:02:00.250> that

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
we pretty much used everything that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.669 
we pretty much used everything that
snapshot<00:02:00.820> threw<00:02:01.210> at<00:02:01.270> us<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.990> first<00:02:02.259> obvious

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
snapshot threw at us the first obvious

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.080 
snapshot threw at us the first obvious
thing<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.039> i've<00:02:03.130> done<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.429> use<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> towel

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
thing that i've done is use the towel

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.910 
thing that i've done is use the towel
roll<00:02:04.330> command<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.840> pay<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.020> clickable<00:02:05.350> messages

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
roll command to pay a clickable messages

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.370 
roll command to pay a clickable messages
then<00:02:06.819> i<00:02:06.850> have<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.270> commander<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> messages

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
then i have the commander the messages

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.370 
then i have the commander the messages
is<00:02:08.700> activating<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> set<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:10.360> c'mon<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
is activating be a set but c'mon so this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.720 
is activating be a set but c'mon so this
sets<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.769> redstone<00:02:12.100> block<00:02:12.489> in<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
sets a redstone block in the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.670 
sets a redstone block in the
corresponding<00:02:13.329> module<00:02:13.720> activates<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.470> motor

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
corresponding module activates the motor

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.220 
corresponding module activates the motor
longmont<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.390> modules<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:17.110> they

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
longmont and the modules what they

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.199 
longmont and the modules what they
basically<00:02:17.530> do<00:02:17.799> is<00:02:17.829> they<00:02:18.100> activate<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
basically do is they activate the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.930 
basically do is they activate the
systems<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.100> propagate<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.280> conversations

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
systems that propagate the conversations

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
systems that propagate the conversations
forward<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.989> they<00:02:23.200> present<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.980> more

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
forward so they present you of more

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.000 
forward so they present you of more
texts<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.030> go<00:02:25.780> down<00:02:25.959> different<00:02:26.380> routes<00:02:26.620> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
texts and go down different routes and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.180 
texts and go down different routes and
create<00:02:27.459> difference<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.920> interactions<00:02:29.920> within

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
create difference of interactions within

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.240 
create difference of interactions within
the<00:02:30.489> menus<00:02:31.049> however<00:02:32.049> pressing<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.920> message

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
the menus however pressing a message

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.250 
the menus however pressing a message
also<00:02:33.489> does<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.790> few<00:02:34.090> other<00:02:34.209> things<00:02:34.299> it<00:02:34.720> sets

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
also does a few other things it sets

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
also does a few other things it sets
glass<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.950> all<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.220> other<00:02:36.340> possible

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
glass and all the other possible

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.460 
glass and all the other possible
redstone<00:02:37.150> block<00:02:37.390> spawn<00:02:37.660> location<00:02:38.170> in<00:02:38.260> order

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
redstone block spawn location in order

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.430 
redstone block spawn location in order
to<00:02:38.560> disable<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.190> other<00:02:39.310> possible<00:02:39.760> options

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
to disable the other possible options

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.539 
to disable the other possible options
the<00:02:41.440> way<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.769> actually<00:02:42.160> done<00:02:42.370> is

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
the way this is actually done is

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.460 
the way this is actually done is
whenever<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.180> tries<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.390> spawn<00:02:43.780> any<00:02:43.989> block<00:02:44.260> it

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
whenever it tries to spawn any block it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.870

another menu it's as simple as

another menu it's as simple as
reactivating<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.049> module<00:03:21.440> do<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.620> wanted<00:03:21.890> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
reactivating the module do you wanted to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030 
reactivating the module do you wanted to
travel<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.900> now<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> have<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.409> elf<00:03:24.680> too<00:03:24.890> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
travel to now I have this elf too and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.430 
travel to now I have this elf too and
also<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.640> low<00:03:25.970> reset<00:03:26.480> that<00:03:26.720> actually<00:03:27.049> resets

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
also a low reset that actually resets

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.530 
also a low reset that actually resets
the<00:03:27.590> memory<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.159> that<00:03:28.190> we<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.549> properly<00:03:29.120> use

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
the memory so that we can properly use

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.500 
the memory so that we can properly use
it<00:03:29.720> again<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.680> now<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:31.940> making<00:03:32.209> any<00:03:32.269> sense

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
it again if now this is making any sense

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.089 
it again if now this is making any sense
you<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:33.230> don't<00:03:33.379> need<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> worry<00:03:33.739> about<00:03:33.799> it

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
you really don't need to worry about it

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.500 
you really don't need to worry about it

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
that you could compact various things

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.880 
that you could compact various things
down<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.209> reason<00:04:08.359> this<00:04:08.720> system<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.709> the
