00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
dishwasher for a really long time

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
dishwasher for a really long time
because<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> saves<00:01:21.960> money<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.380> yet<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:22.890> won't

concerned about this I mean this seems
this<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> those<00:01:39.750> science<00:01:40.229> things<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this is one of those science things and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.080 
this is one of those science things and
I<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.860> people<00:01:41.100> freaked<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.700> when

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I know people freaked out when

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
I know people freaked out when
scientists<00:01:42.659> sometimes<00:01:42.960> say<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.500> might<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
scientists sometimes say there might be

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
scientists sometimes say there might be
climate<00:01:44.610> change<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.970> something<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
climate change or something like that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.370 
climate change or something like that
they<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.689> don't<00:01:45.810> believe<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.170> science

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
they said we don't believe in science

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.889 
they said we don't believe in science
but<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:46.950> scientists<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.610> saying<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.869> a

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
but if scientists are saying we got a

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
but if scientists are saying we got a
real<00:01:49.110> problem<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:49.710> water<00:01:49.890> situation<00:01:50.159> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
real problem with our water situation in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340 
real problem with our water situation in
California<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.060> care<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.540> hate<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.170> sound

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
California and we care I hate to sound

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.690 
California and we care I hate to sound
like<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.649> science<00:01:53.159> than<00:01:53.340> iron

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
like a science than iron

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.410 
like a science than iron
yeah<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:55.229> usually<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:56.310> if<00:01:57.060> we're<00:01:57.390> in

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
yeah and I'm usually not but if we're in

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
yeah and I'm usually not but if we're in
such<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> drastic<00:01:58.200> drought<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> we're<00:01:59.219> gonna

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
such a drastic drought and we're gonna

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
such a drastic drought and we're gonna
run<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> water<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> year<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.750> what

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
run out of water in a year which is what

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.270 
run out of water in a year which is what
they're<00:02:01.170> saying<00:02:01.439> how<00:02:01.770> come<00:02:01.890> we're<00:02:02.100> still

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
they're saying how come we're still

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
they're saying how come we're still
 in<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> we're<00:02:03.509> still<00:02:04.140> in

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
 in it we're still in

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.789 
 in it we're still in
water<00:02:04.799> clean<00:02:05.340> water<00:02:05.820> every<00:02:06.090> day<00:02:06.600> every<00:02:07.290> person

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
water clean water every day every person

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
water clean water every day every person
in<00:02:07.979> California<00:02:08.280> shits<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.660> bucket<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.229> clean

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
in California shits in a bucket of clean

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
in California shits in a bucket of clean
 water<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.270> system

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
 water that's the system

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.780 
 water that's the system
we<00:02:12.930> figured<00:02:13.350> out<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.709> would<00:02:13.980> list<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.340> Las<00:02:14.490> Vegas

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
we figured out I would list in Las Vegas

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.120 
we figured out I would list in Las Vegas
we're<00:02:15.240> gonna<00:02:15.360> make<00:02:15.630> skip<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.200> water<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.770> there

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
we're gonna make skip the water on there

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.370 
we're gonna make skip the water on there
so<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.940> people<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.330> drink<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.020> people

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
so that for people to drink so people

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.860 
so that for people to drink so people
can<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.790> Vegas<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.630> book

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
can in it in Vegas they don't book

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.360 
can in it in Vegas they don't book
and<00:02:22.050> bring<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> water<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:22.890> drinking

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
and bring the water and for drinking

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.890 
and bring the water and for drinking
it's<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.880> pissing<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.480> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it's for pissing and in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.800 
it's for pissing and in
perfectly<00:02:25.590> clean<00:02:25.890> water<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.850> our<00:02:27.240> system

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
perfectly clean water this is our system

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
perfectly clean water this is our system
we<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.350> been<00:02:28.500> come<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:28.980> another<00:02:29.250> system

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
we have been come up with another system

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.180 
we have been come up with another system
when<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.060> stop<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.290> perfectly<00:02:31.800> clean

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
when we stop in perfectly clean

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.949 
when we stop in perfectly clean
water<00:02:32.520> that's<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.360> believe<00:02:33.630> we're<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.870> a

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
water that's what I believe we're in a

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.199 
water that's what I believe we're in a
real<00:02:34.170> drought<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.800> ever<00:02:35.280> costs<00:02:35.790> more<00:02:36.000> than<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
real drought you ever costs more than a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.360 
real drought you ever costs more than a
dying<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.870> gallon<00:02:37.410> coming<00:02:37.709> out<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.950> Mike<00:02:38.100> foster

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
dying a gallon coming out of Mike foster

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.949 
dying a gallon coming out of Mike foster
because<00:02:38.580> right<00:02:38.880> now<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.300> doesn't<00:02:39.600> cost<00:02:39.750> Oh

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
because right now it doesn't cost Oh

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.960 
because right now it doesn't cost Oh
maybe<00:02:40.290> even<00:02:40.590> two<00:02:40.920> cents<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.400> gallon<00:02:41.580> doesn't

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
maybe even two cents a gallon doesn't

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030 
maybe even two cents a gallon doesn't
quite<00:02:42.060> anything<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.050> maybe<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:43.830> more

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
quite anything so maybe if it was more

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.710 
quite anything so maybe if it was more
expensive<00:02:44.220> people<00:02:44.730> would<00:02:44.940> stop

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
expensive people would stop

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.870 
expensive people would stop
hosing<00:02:46.350> down<00:02:46.380> their<00:02:46.739> driveways<00:02:47.610> my

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
hosing down their driveways my

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.250 
hosing down their driveways my
brother-in-law<00:02:48.300> hoses<00:02:48.720> down<00:02:48.750> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
brother-in-law hoses down a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
brother-in-law hoses down a
driveway<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.100> know<00:02:50.160> why<00:02:50.310> cause<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.610> costs<00:02:50.820> two

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
driveway you know why cause it costs two

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.670 
driveway you know why cause it costs two
cents<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.480> gallon<00:02:51.630> right<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.380> wanted

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
cents a gallon right I don't we wanted

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.590 
cents a gallon right I don't we wanted
to<00:02:52.769> cost<00:02:53.040> two<00:02:53.250> dollars<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.670> gallon<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.150> people

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
to cost two dollars a gallon and people

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.180 
to cost two dollars a gallon and people
will<00:02:54.750> start<00:02:54.959> conserving<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.040> what's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
will start conserving it you know what's

something<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.970> recognize<00:04:48.690> where

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
something like that you recognize where

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.210 
something like that you recognize where
the<00:04:49.110> difference<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.710> when<00:04:49.980> there's<00:04:50.130> a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
the difference is when there's a

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.640 
the difference is when there's a
reservoir<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.000> actually<00:04:51.570> drying<00:04:51.990> up<00:04:52.320> over

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
reservoir that's actually drying up over

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.030 
reservoir that's actually drying up over
the<00:04:52.740> course<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.190> year<00:04:53.220> as<00:04:53.490> my<00:04:53.850> relationship

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
the course of a year as my relationship

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.920 
the course of a year as my relationship
is<00:04:56.040> drying<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.490> was<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.669> beautiful<00:04:57.180> metaphor<00:04:57.390> it

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
is drying it was a beautiful metaphor it

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.990 
is drying it was a beautiful metaphor it
cost<00:04:58.140> more<00:04:58.410> money<00:04:58.470> why<00:04:58.950> won't<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.400> supply<00:04:59.820> and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
cost more money why won't it supply and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.850 
cost more money why won't it supply and
demand<00:05:00.390> why<00:05:00.840> doesn't<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.290> I<00:05:01.350> mean<00:05:01.560> if<00:05:01.740> they

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
demand why doesn't it I mean if they

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.680 
demand why doesn't it I mean if they
want<00:05:02.070> us<00:05:02.190> to<00:05:02.220> conserve<00:05:02.760> make<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.210> cost<00:05:03.450> more

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
want us to conserve make it cost more

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.510 
want us to conserve make it cost more
well<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.020> think<00:05:04.169> what's<00:05:04.620> happening<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.130> at

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
well I think what's happening is that at

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
well I think what's happening is that at
least<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.760> California<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:06.300> that<00:05:06.450> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
least in California is that the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.180 
least in California is that the
politicians<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.440> are<00:05:07.620> running<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.070> state

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
politicians that are running the state

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.430 
politicians that are running the state
legislature<00:05:08.730> up<00:05:08.850> in<00:05:09.000> Sacramento<00:05:09.600> they<00:05:10.169> know

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
legislature up in Sacramento they know

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.620 
legislature up in Sacramento they know
that<00:05:10.680> people<00:05:10.830> refuse<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.700> pay<00:05:11.850> more<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.240> it's

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
that people refuse to pay more and it's

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.940 
that people refuse to pay more and it's
the<00:05:12.660> way<00:05:12.780> politics<00:05:13.230> always<00:05:13.440> work<00:05:13.740> they're

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
the way politics always work they're

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.920 
the way politics always work they're
always<00:05:14.130> living<00:05:14.550> for<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.790> day<00:05:14.970> they're<00:05:15.720> not

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
always living for the day they're not

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.510 
always living for the day they're not
living<00:05:16.320> for<00:05:16.500> what's<00:05:16.680> gonna<00:05:16.800> happen<00:05:17.160> next<00:05:17.280> I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
living for what's gonna happen next I

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.830 
living for what's gonna happen next I
think<00:05:17.940> also<00:05:18.060> part<00:05:18.300> of<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.419> problem<00:05:18.540> here<00:05:18.720> is

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
think also part of the problem here is

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.990 
think also part of the problem here is
that<00:05:18.990> when<00:05:19.350> we<00:05:19.380> look<00:05:19.680> at<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.220> globe<00:05:20.490> or<00:05:20.850> if<00:05:20.940> you

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
that when we look at the globe or if you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.870 
that when we look at the globe or if you
look<00:05:21.150> at<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.270> map<00:05:21.540> it's<00:05:22.080> something<00:05:22.350> like<00:05:22.460> 71%<00:05:23.460> of

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
look at a map it's something like 71% of

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.450 
look at a map it's something like 71% of
the<00:05:24.330> earth<00:05:24.510> is<00:05:24.750> covered<00:05:24.990> by<00:05:25.140> water<00:05:25.380> so<00:05:26.160> people

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
the earth is covered by water so people

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.060 
the earth is covered by water so people
can't<00:05:26.700> really<00:05:26.880> understand<00:05:27.479> why<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.500> autumn

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
can't really understand why it's autumn

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.710 
can't really understand why it's autumn
all<00:05:29.190> right<00:05:29.550> but<00:05:29.850> but<00:05:30.030> I<00:05:30.060> think<00:05:30.300> do<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.570> think

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
all right but but I think do you think

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.330 
all right but but I think do you think
that's<00:05:30.840> part<00:05:31.140> of<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.320> just<00:05:31.350> visually<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.130> look

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
that's part of it just visually you look

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.580 
that's part of it just visually you look
at<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.790> look<00:05:32.970> at<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.300> earth<00:05:33.720> it's<00:05:34.320> blue

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
at a you look at the earth it's blue

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.590 
at a you look at the earth it's blue
because<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.190> water<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:35.820> people<00:05:36.000> can't<00:05:36.419> really

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
because of water so people can't really

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.530 
because of water so people can't really
understand<00:05:37.200> their<00:05:38.010> mouth<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:39.030> do<00:05:39.120> wonder<00:05:39.390> about

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
understand their mouth I do wonder about

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.450 
understand their mouth I do wonder about
those<00:05:39.750> plants<00:05:40.350> where<00:05:40.650> they<00:05:41.070> can<00:05:41.220> take<00:05:41.340> the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
those plants where they can take the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.250 
those plants where they can take the
salt<00:05:41.760> out<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.330> water<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.690> mean<00:05:42.840> yeah<00:05:43.020> I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
salt out of the water I mean yeah I

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.840 
salt out of the water I mean yeah I
don't<00:05:43.350> know<00:05:43.650> what<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.040> science<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.520> behind

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
don't know what the science is behind

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.159 
don't know what the science is behind
that<00:05:45.030> in<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.210> they<00:05:45.300> work<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.720> mean<00:05:45.870> they<00:05:45.990> have

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
that in it they work I mean they have

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.510 
that in it they work I mean they have
them<00:05:46.320> in<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.500> Middle<00:05:46.710> East<00:05:46.860> in<00:05:47.040> it<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.400> it

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
them in the Middle East in it and it

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.980 
them in the Middle East in it and it
works<00:05:47.820> but<00:05:48.150> it<00:05:48.240> takes<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.570> tremendous<00:05:48.720> amount

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
works but it takes a tremendous amount

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.110 
works but it takes a tremendous amount
of<00:05:49.200> energy<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.860> do<00:05:50.040> oh<00:05:50.250> there<00:05:50.790> you<00:05:50.910> go<00:05:51.000> that's

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
of energy to do oh there you go that's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.780 
of energy to do oh there you go that's
the<00:05:51.330> problem<00:05:51.510> then<00:05:51.840> energy<00:05:52.410> cost<00:05:52.800> yeah<00:05:53.130> yeah

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
the problem then energy cost yeah yeah

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.670 
the problem then energy cost yeah yeah
they're<00:05:53.970> gonna<00:05:54.090> figure<00:05:54.330> out<00:05:54.450> how<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.780> get

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
they're gonna figure out how to get

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.440 
they're gonna figure out how to get
water<00:05:55.919> out<00:05:56.040> of<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.370> seawater<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.330> they're

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
water out of the seawater and they're

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.270 
water out of the seawater and they're
gonna<00:05:57.570> figure<00:05:57.900> out<00:05:58.050> how<00:05:58.169> to<00:05:58.229> cool<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:59.010> thing

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
gonna figure out how to cool the thing

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.870 
gonna figure out how to cool the thing
so<00:05:59.970> it's<00:06:00.090> all<00:06:00.180> gonna<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:02.190> a<00:06:02.220> spirit<00:06:02.700> talking

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
so it's all gonna have a spirit talking

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.130 
so it's all gonna have a spirit talking
they're<00:06:03.060> gonna<00:06:03.150> figure<00:06:03.390> out<00:06:03.510> how<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.810> do<00:06:03.990> it

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
they're gonna figure out how to do it

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.530 
they're gonna figure out how to do it
and<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:05.250> science<00:06:05.460> yeah<00:06:05.760> well<00:06:06.000> we<00:06:06.240> really

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
and the science yeah well we really

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.390 
and the science yeah well we really
brought<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.410> home<00:06:07.620> with<00:06:07.800> science<00:06:08.190> that's

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
brought that home with science that's

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.010 
brought that home with science that's
what<00:06:08.580> I'm<00:06:08.669> talking<00:06:09.030> about<00:06:09.090> people<00:06:09.270> anyway

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
what I'm talking about people anyway

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.690 
what I'm talking about people anyway
what<00:06:10.200> do<00:06:10.260> you<00:06:10.320> think<00:06:10.500> are<00:06:10.680> we<00:06:10.710> really<00:06:11.040> a<00:06:11.160> year

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
what do you think are we really a year

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.920 
what do you think are we really a year
away<00:06:11.910> from<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.210> massive<00:06:12.570> drought<00:06:12.780> in

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
away from a massive drought in

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.050 
away from a massive drought in
