00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.410
 launch with this 500x would be summer 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.410
 be able to bear fruit 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.250
 a previous time that fiat based on the 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.700
 500 of the larger car made that got 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 venture 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.750
 the fiat 500l everyone trade k 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.820
 however, the 500x has the playfulness 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.860
 a little brother 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.760
 the fiat 500x is not just fun 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.370
 to see there also fit 4 people in one 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.120
 also adjusts the necessary baggage 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:46.860
 although 350 and a maximum of 1000 liters 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 that's not wrong for a 500 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.280
 fiat 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.520
 all kinds of sound-insulating materials 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.570
 installed in the interior 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.610
 right up to the alpha window styles 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 Romeo has taken over the opportunity to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.619
 setting different driving modes 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.570
 with the so-called drive mood selector 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.140
 do you choose whether the fiat is sporty or correct 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.140
 economical driving 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.220
 it is one of the few playful things 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.229
 on the 500x with you it might not be 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.790
 but for such an insane tip he is 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.619
 dead serious 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.660
 just look at the safety equipment 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.430
 there is a lane assistant on one 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.720
 independent braking system 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.369
 and a system that alerts you when 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.369
 there is traffic in you too 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.289
 no if you want to smile then you must be 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.420
 brother have the 500x bobbin 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.100
 decroos has four-wheel drive one 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.100
 greater clearance 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.869
 including so-called start-up books that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 means that you drive less 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.420
 lands quickly 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.420
 when you leave the paved road the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.250
 500x is the first 500 derivative that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.130
 at least as nice as the original 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
 the cross version yes that is of course the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.549
 superlative 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.380
 but with this regular x it already shows something 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.739
 pleasure also enjoyable 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.739
 useful
