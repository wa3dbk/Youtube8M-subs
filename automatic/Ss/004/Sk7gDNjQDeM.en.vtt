for<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.960> we're<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.250> C<00:02:43.520> milk

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
for that we're going to do the C milk

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.000 
for that we're going to do the C milk
so<00:02:44.030> that's<00:02:44.210> your<00:02:45.250> your<00:02:46.250> number<00:02:46.700> two<00:02:46.970> note<00:02:47.600> as

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
so that's your your number two note as

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.949 
so that's your your number two note as
the<00:02:49.010> diagram<00:02:49.580> says<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:54.040> middle<00:02:55.040> finger<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the diagram says so middle finger on the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.010 
the diagram says so middle finger on the
number<00:02:57.100> two<00:02:58.100> note<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.550> middle<00:02:58.820> note<00:02:59.020> three

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
number two note the middle note three

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.990 
number two note the middle note three
there<00:03:00.260> got<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.830> middle<00:03:01.130> one<00:03:01.280> middle<00:03:01.610> finger

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
there got the middle one middle finger

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.120 
there got the middle one middle finger

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
note number one that's a B so C B then

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.259 
note number one that's a B so C B then
press<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.630> C<00:03:21.050> down<00:03:21.320> again<00:03:21.769> along<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.060> B

g f e d and low c alright your first
scale<00:05:41.870> now<00:05:42.740> we're<00:05:43.039> doing<00:05:43.190> this<00:05:43.460> one<00:05:44.110> backwards

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
scale now we're doing this one backwards

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.670 
scale now we're doing this one backwards
meaning<00:05:45.919> from<00:05:46.460> middle<00:05:47.360> c<00:05:47.570> down<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.200> low<00:05:48.410> c

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
meaning from middle c down to low c

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.659 
meaning from middle c down to low c
instead<00:05:49.039> of<00:05:49.220> low<00:05:49.400> C<00:05:49.729> up<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.060> middle<00:05:50.780> C<00:05:51.460> which<00:05:52.460> is

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
instead of low C up to middle C which is

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.680 
instead of low C up to middle C which is
how<00:05:52.820> you<00:05:53.349> would<00:05:54.349> normally<00:05:54.770> do<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.099> but<00:05:55.690> you

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
how you would normally do it but you

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.290 
how you would normally do it but you
need<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.169> practice<00:05:57.410> your<00:05:57.830> scales<00:05:58.099> up<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:59.090> down

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
need to practice your scales up and down

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.190 
need to practice your scales up and down
anyways<00:05:59.780> but<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.349> reason<00:06:00.820> we're<00:06:01.820> going<00:06:02.200> from

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
anyways but the reason we're going from

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.120 
anyways but the reason we're going from
the<00:06:04.160> middle<00:06:04.930> one<00:06:05.930> down<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.620> low<00:06:06.800> one<00:06:06.979> is

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
the middle one down to the low one is

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.870 
the middle one down to the low one is
because<00:06:08.169> it's<00:06:09.169> easier<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:09.710> play<00:06:09.979> a<00:06:10.940> middle<00:06:11.599> C

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
because it's easier to play a middle C

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.290 
because it's easier to play a middle C
that<00:06:13.880> it<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.150> a<00:06:14.360> low<00:06:14.660> C<00:06:16.000> especially<00:06:17.000> as<00:06:17.090> we're

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
that it is a low C especially as we're

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.320 
that it is a low C especially as we're
starting<00:06:17.720> out<00:06:17.870> you<00:06:18.410> might<00:06:18.590> have<00:06:18.830> a<00:06:18.970> bad<00:06:19.970> read

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
starting out you might have a bad read

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.779 
starting out you might have a bad read
or<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:21.169> might<00:06:21.620> have<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.800> problem<00:06:22.160> getting

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:22.789 
or you might have a problem getting

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.100 
or you might have a problem getting
enough<00:06:23.360> air<00:06:23.630> under<00:06:23.960> your<00:06:24.110> horn<00:06:24.380> so<00:06:25.030> if<00:06:26.110> that's

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
enough air under your horn so if that's

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.469 
enough air under your horn so if that's
the<00:06:27.380> case<00:06:27.560> then<00:06:27.830> playing<00:06:28.220> a<00:06:28.430> low<00:06:28.580> C<00:06:28.940> right<00:06:29.330> off

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
the case then playing a low C right off

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.339 
the case then playing a low C right off
the<00:06:29.690> bat<00:06:29.900> is<00:06:30.520> really<00:06:31.520> hard<00:06:31.789> if<00:06:32.599> not<00:06:32.660> next<00:06:33.169> to

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
the bat is really hard if not next to

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:35.200 
the bat is really hard if not next to
impossible<00:06:33.650> when<00:06:34.190> we're<00:06:34.370> first<00:06:34.640> starting<00:06:35.120> out

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
impossible when we're first starting out

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.740 
impossible when we're first starting out
so<00:06:35.650> a<00:06:36.650> smart<00:06:37.640> way<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:37.820> do<00:06:38.030> it<00:06:38.180> is<00:06:38.330> to

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
so a smart way to do it is to

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.710 
so a smart way to do it is to
you<00:06:39.710> know<00:06:39.830> develop<00:06:40.400> starting<00:06:41.330> from<00:06:41.510> the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
you know develop starting from the

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.380 
you know develop starting from the
middle<00:06:42.290> C<00:06:42.500> and<00:06:42.710> working<00:06:43.520> your<00:06:43.670> way<00:06:43.700> down<00:06:43.880> and

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
middle C and working your way down and

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.650 
middle C and working your way down and
you'll<00:06:44.510> feel<00:06:44.900> that<00:06:45.130> it<00:06:46.130> will<00:06:46.430> get<00:06:46.790> harder<00:06:47.210> when

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
you'll feel that it will get harder when

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.170 
you'll feel that it will get harder when
you<00:06:47.810> get<00:06:48.020> down<00:06:48.590> in<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.370> bottom<00:06:49.700> of<00:06:49.820> the<00:06:49.910> horn

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
you get down in the bottom of the horn

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.200 
you get down in the bottom of the horn
especially<00:06:51.080> if<00:06:51.200> you<00:06:51.290> have<00:06:51.500> some<00:06:52.210> horn

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
especially if you have some horn

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.900 
especially if you have some horn
problems<00:06:53.720> like<00:06:53.900> leeks<00:06:54.230> or<00:06:54.530> if<00:06:55.040> you<00:06:55.190> have<00:06:55.340> a<00:06:55.370> bad

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
problems like leeks or if you have a bad

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.700 
problems like leeks or if you have a bad
read<00:06:56.210> or<00:06:56.390> not<00:06:56.480> a<00:06:56.600> great<00:06:56.900> mouthpiece<00:06:57.410> at<00:06:57.590> the

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
read or not a great mouthpiece at the

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.660 
read or not a great mouthpiece at the
beginning<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:59.030> your<00:06:59.210> studies<00:06:59.600> here<00:07:00.550> you<00:07:01.550> know

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
beginning of your studies here you know

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.390 
beginning of your studies here you know
even<00:07:02.600> if<00:07:02.720> you<00:07:02.750> do<00:07:02.960> have<00:07:03.170> a<00:07:03.200> good<00:07:03.650> set<00:07:03.950> up<00:07:04.100> and<00:07:04.340> a

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
even if you do have a good set up and a

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.430 
even if you do have a good set up and a
good<00:07:04.580> horn<00:07:04.850> it's<00:07:05.390> still<00:07:05.690> a<00:07:05.720> little<00:07:06.020> harder<00:07:06.350> to

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 
good horn it's still a little harder to

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400 
good horn it's still a little harder to
get<00:07:06.590> those<00:07:06.770> low<00:07:07.480> saxophone<00:07:08.480> notes<00:07:08.750> so<00:07:09.020> good

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
get those low saxophone notes so good

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.960 
get those low saxophone notes so good
idea<00:07:09.680> to<00:07:09.860> start<00:07:10.160> from<00:07:10.370> the<00:07:10.490> middle<00:07:10.760> and<00:07:10.880> work

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
idea to start from the middle and work

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.690 
idea to start from the middle and work
your<00:07:11.240> way<00:07:11.300> down<00:07:11.450> and<00:07:11.900> as<00:07:12.560> if<00:07:12.919> you<00:07:13.160> start<00:07:13.460> losing

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
your way down and as if you start losing

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.300 
your way down and as if you start losing
control<00:07:14.090> and<00:07:14.750> if<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.530> notes<00:07:15.710> are<00:07:15.890> starting<00:07:16.220> to

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
control and if the notes are starting to

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.720 
control and if the notes are starting to
get<00:07:16.400> hard<00:07:16.640> the<00:07:16.970> lower<00:07:17.240> you<00:07:17.390> go<00:07:17.540> just<00:07:18.220> feed<00:07:19.220> your

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
get hard the lower you go just feed your

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.400 
get hard the lower you go just feed your
saxophone<00:07:20.500> more<00:07:21.500> air<00:07:22.000> from<00:07:23.000> your<00:07:23.410> diaphragm

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
saxophone more air from your diaphragm

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.840 
saxophone more air from your diaphragm
okay<00:07:25.220> just<00:07:25.520> push<00:07:26.240> really<00:07:26.540> hard<00:07:26.660> play<00:07:27.260> loud<00:07:27.850> if

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:28.850 
okay just push really hard play loud if

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.760 
okay just push really hard play loud if
it<00:07:29.060> sounds<00:07:29.390> really<00:07:29.540> ugly<00:07:29.930> doesn't<00:07:30.169> matter<00:07:30.530> at

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
it sounds really ugly doesn't matter at

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.620 
it sounds really ugly doesn't matter at
the<00:07:31.010> at<00:07:31.280> these<00:07:31.520> beginning<00:07:32.030> stages<00:07:32.300> it's

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.630 
the at these beginning stages it's

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.750 
the at these beginning stages it's
really<00:07:32.990> important<00:07:33.440> to<00:07:33.530> play<00:07:33.770> loud<00:07:34.160> and<00:07:34.460> strong

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760 
really important to play loud and strong

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.230 
really important to play loud and strong
so<00:07:35.690> you<00:07:35.780> can<00:07:36.010> start<00:07:37.010> to<00:07:37.160> develop<00:07:37.400> some<00:07:37.760> sort<00:07:38.120> of

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
so you can start to develop some sort of

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.790 
so you can start to develop some sort of
tone<00:07:38.500> will<00:07:39.500> refine<00:07:39.919> it<00:07:40.130> later<00:07:40.340> okay
