going nice and smooth it's engaging

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.960 
going nice and smooth it's engaging
laterally<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:46.840> less<00:01:47.549> problem<00:01:48.549> up<00:01:48.700> going

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
a large discoid Clio there's a little

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.359 
a large discoid Clio there's a little
bunch<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.200> different<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.649> mean<00:02:05.830> use<00:02:06.190> whatever

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369

that<00:02:07.990> nice<00:02:08.259> contour

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that nice contour

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.370 
that nice contour
okay<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.530> we<00:02:11.620> got<00:02:11.739> pear-shaped

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
okay so we got pear-shaped

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.850 
okay so we got pear-shaped
and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.330 
and
the<00:02:16.330> dis<00:02:17.330> quickly<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.710> did<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.220> all

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
the dis quickly so we did that for all

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.200 
the dis quickly so we did that for all
the<00:02:19.550> preps

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.340 

additionally<00:02:23.210> then<00:02:23.480> we're<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.930> place<00:02:24.200> a

additionally then we're going to place a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.380 
additionally then we're going to place a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
die spacer so a whole bunch of different

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.880 
die spacer so a whole bunch of different

so I'm not sure what that means but

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.440 
so I'm not sure what that means but
we're<00:03:22.270> gonna<00:03:22.360> go<00:03:22.540> with<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:23.320> 0.5<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.100> really

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
I mean studies have shown from 25

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.610 
I mean studies have shown from 25
microns<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.360> 60<00:03:31.690> microns<00:03:32.110> there's<00:03:32.380> another

study<00:03:32.860> was<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.010> looking<00:03:33.340> at<00:03:33.400> me<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> from<00:03:35.080> one

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
study was just looking at me so from one

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.350 
study was just looking at me so from one

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
know what resident with cement they were

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.010 
know what resident with cement they were
using<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.220> here's<00:03:42.400> 20<00:03:42.730> microns<00:03:43.540> let's<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:43.870> go

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
using so here's 20 microns let's just go

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.340 
using so here's 20 microns let's just go
with<00:03:45.270> whatever<00:03:46.270> you<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.660> been<00:03:46.780> taught<00:03:46.990> I'm

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
with whatever you have been taught I'm

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.670 
with whatever you have been taught I'm
just<00:03:47.740> going<00:03:47.920> with<00:03:48.720> 20<00:03:49.720> microns<00:03:50.110> one<00:03:50.380> coat<00:03:51.660> and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
just going with 20 microns one coat and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
just going with 20 microns one coat and
there<00:03:53.680> are<00:03:53.770> different<00:03:54.070> variations<00:03:54.310> on<00:03:54.640> the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.080 
volatile monomer vaporators it's it
changed<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.959> thickness<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.410> course<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.739> does

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
changed the thickness of course it does

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.580 
changed the thickness of course it does
however<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.660> place<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.350> in<00:04:08.410> a

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
however so you can place this in a

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.339 
however so you can place this in a
little<00:04:08.830> Dappen<00:04:09.160> dish<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.640> then<00:04:09.730> use<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> brush

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.249 

I'll<00:04:13.829> be<00:04:13.920> honest<00:04:14.189> with<00:04:14.340> what<00:04:14.670> probably<00:04:15.269> 99%<00:04:16.079> of

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
I'll be honest with what probably 99% of

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.930 
I'll be honest with what probably 99% of
the<00:04:16.350> world<00:04:16.500> does<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:17.340> right<00:04:17.669> out<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
the world does is right out of the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.060 
the world does is right out of the
bottle<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.109> we're<00:04:19.199> gonna<00:04:19.289> do<00:04:19.440> one<00:04:19.620> coat<00:04:19.859> we're

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
bottle so we're gonna do one coat we're

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.760 
bottle so we're gonna do one coat we're
gonna<00:04:20.250> try<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.459> go<00:04:21.139> get<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.320> here

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
gonna try to go get it here

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.080 
gonna try to go get it here
Oh<00:04:23.509> point<00:04:24.509> five<00:04:24.780> that's<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.889> one<00:04:26.669> way<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.060> I

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
Oh point five that's a one way to you I

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.570 
Oh point five that's a one way to you I
mean<00:04:27.270> there's<00:04:27.449> many<00:04:28.070> thousands<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.130> way<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.340> do

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
mean there's many thousands a way to do

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:40.230 
mean there's many thousands a way to do
this

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.100 

so<00:04:40.810> these<00:04:40.930> are<00:04:41.110> going<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.560> be<00:04:41.740> pfm<00:04:42.220> crowns

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.900 

you<00:04:45.650> can<00:04:45.830> see<00:04:46.010> how<00:04:46.100> it's<00:04:46.250> tacky<00:04:46.550> there<00:04:46.790> it's

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
you can see how it's tacky there it's

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.180 
you can see how it's tacky there it's
already<00:04:47.240> drying

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.960 

so<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:52.850> can<00:04:53.000> use<00:04:53.150> thinner<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:54.530> thin<00:04:54.770> out<00:04:54.890> your

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.480 

even<00:04:57.449> Anna<00:04:57.600> Dappen<00:04:57.990> dish<00:04:58.040> or<00:04:59.040> thin<00:04:59.220> out<00:04:59.340> the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
even Anna Dappen dish or thin out the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:19.930 
even Anna Dappen dish or thin out the
entire<00:04:59.910> bottle

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.350 

perhaps<00:05:20.660> this<00:05:20.840> is<00:05:21.130> akin<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.190> watching<00:05:23.180> paint

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
perhaps this is akin to watching paint

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:34.150 
perhaps this is akin to watching paint
dry

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.240 

I'm<00:05:34.730> sure<00:05:34.910> there<00:05:35.120> are<00:05:35.210> ways<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.980> handle<00:05:36.980> this

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
I'm sure there are ways to handle this

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.530 
I'm sure there are ways to handle this
manipulate<00:05:38.150> it

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
manipulate it

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.970 
manipulate it
other<00:05:40.110> than<00:05:40.290> using<00:05:40.470> this<00:05:40.710> large<00:05:40.980> brush

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.490 

and<00:05:45.280> if<00:05:45.370> you<00:05:45.520> know<00:05:45.670> some<00:05:45.970> please<00:05:46.320> put<00:05:47.320> them<00:05:47.410> in

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
and if you know some please put them in

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.640 
and if you know some please put them in
the<00:05:47.620> comments<00:05:48.360> okay

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
the comments okay

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.070 
the comments okay
so<00:05:50.650> there's<00:05:50.920> that<00:05:51.900> approximately<00:05:52.900> 1

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
so there's that approximately 1

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.570 
so there's that approximately 1
millimeter<00:05:53.560> half<00:05:54.010> a<00:05:54.100> millimeter<00:05:54.460> away<00:05:54.520> from

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
millimeter half a millimeter away from

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.270 
millimeter half a millimeter away from
the<00:05:54.790> margin<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.270> let<00:05:55.540> that<00:05:55.660> dry<00:05:55.950> so<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.100> next

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
the margin I let that dry so the next

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.310 
the margin I let that dry so the next
stage<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:58.330> this<00:05:58.570> is<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.780> requirements<00:05:59.230> for

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
stage and this is the requirements for

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.110 
stage and this is the requirements for
our<00:06:00.000> laboratory<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.330> our<00:06:01.450> techniques<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.830> to

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
our laboratory and our techniques is to
