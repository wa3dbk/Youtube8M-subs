00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
not that great and that is because I was

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.890 
not that great and that is because I was
working<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> living<00:00:21.240> room<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.630> I'd<00:00:21.720> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
working in the living room so I'd have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.259 
working in the living room so I'd have
more<00:00:22.109> space<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> lighting<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.029> is

more space but the lighting in there is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.349 
more space but the lighting in there is
pretty<00:00:25.109> terrible<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> did<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> best<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359

was<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.130> hard<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:48.229> bent<00:01:49.229> my

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
was really hard to do I actually bent my

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
was really hard to do I actually bent my
hand<00:01:49.920> sewing<00:01:50.159> needle<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:52.020> really

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
hand sewing needle like really really

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.990 
hand sewing needle like really really
badly<00:01:52.439> because<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.430> trying<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> sew

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
badly because I was trying to sew

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
badly because I was trying to sew
through<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> layers<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:55.049> once<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
through all the layers at once and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.130 
through all the layers at once and
instead<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.790> had<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.570> through<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> couple

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
instead I had to go through a couple

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.499 
instead I had to go through a couple
layers<00:01:58.439> at<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> time<00:01:59.009> until<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.909> made<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
layers at a time until I made it all the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.139 
layers at a time until I made it all the
way<00:02:00.630> through<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:02.310> worked<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.640> okay<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
way through and that worked out okay it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.539 
way through and that worked out okay it
was<00:02:03.240> still<00:02:03.450> pretty<00:02:03.869> difficult<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.649> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
was still pretty difficult to do but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.330 
was still pretty difficult to do but
then<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> sewed<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.869> shorter<00:02:07.740> ends<00:02:08.129> together

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
then I sewed the shorter ends together

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.639 
then I sewed the shorter ends together
in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> back<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> also<00:02:09.989> gathered<00:02:10.319> two

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
in the back and I also gathered two

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.210 
in the back and I also gathered two
small<00:02:11.160> sections<00:02:11.670> near<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
small sections near the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550 
small sections near the
but<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> was<00:02:12.910> just<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.630> help<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.990> fabric<00:02:14.170> lay

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
but that was just to help the fabric lay

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.130 
but that was just to help the fabric lay
right<00:02:14.860> then<00:02:15.460> I<00:02:15.730> put<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.240> two<00:02:16.570> pieces<00:02:16.750> together

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
right then I put the two pieces together

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.530 
right then I put the two pieces together
the<00:02:17.830> skirt<00:02:18.280> front<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.670> back<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.060> then<00:02:19.270> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the skirt front and back and then the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.260 
the skirt front and back and then the
curved<00:02:19.870> section<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:21.310> penned<00:02:21.640> all<00:02:21.910> along

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
curved section and I penned all along

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.110 
curved section and I penned all along
the<00:02:22.450> top<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.110> actually<00:02:23.260> cut<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:24.120> little

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
the top and I actually cut a little

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.780 
the top and I actually cut a little
shallow<00:02:25.480> curve<00:02:25.960> into<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> front<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
shallow curve into the front so that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.600 
shallow curve into the front so that
when<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.330> my<00:02:28.510> waist<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.140> will<00:02:29.200> sit<00:02:29.830> nicer

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
when it's on my waist it will sit nicer

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.540 
when it's on my waist it will sit nicer
I<00:02:30.640> sewed<00:02:31.510> along<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.990> top<00:02:32.290> edge<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.890> attach<00:02:33.220> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
I sewed along the top edge to attach the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.540 
I sewed along the top edge to attach the
layers<00:02:33.790> together<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.630> then<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.440> created<00:02:36.340> an

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
layers together and then I created an

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.480 
layers together and then I created an
elastic<00:02:37.090> casing<00:02:37.540> by<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:38.500> turning<00:02:38.770> it<00:02:39.040> under

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
elastic casing by just turning it under

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.300 
elastic casing by just turning it under
I<00:02:39.730> wanted<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.630> create<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.960> double<00:02:41.470> casing<00:02:42.040> so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
I wanted to create a double casing so

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.160 
I wanted to create a double casing so
that<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.460> could<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.880> two<00:02:43.210> rows<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.570> elastic

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that I could have two rows of elastic

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.470 
that I could have two rows of elastic
just<00:02:45.130> since<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.700> skirt<00:02:45.970> was<00:02:46.150> getting<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just since the skirt was getting a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.570 
just since the skirt was getting a
little<00:02:46.600> heavy<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.410> thought<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.040> extra

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
little heavy and I thought the extra

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.420 
little heavy and I thought the extra
elastic<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:49.180> help<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:50.560> because<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.280> was

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
elastic would help but because I was

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.280 
elastic would help but because I was
sewing<00:02:51.640> through<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.180> many<00:02:52.300> layers<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.170> was

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
sewing through so many layers and it was

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840 
sewing through so many layers and it was
so<00:02:53.410> close<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.800> two<00:02:53.920> gathers<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.459> everything

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
so close to two gathers and everything

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.600 
so close to two gathers and everything
it<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.060> did<00:02:55.570> not<00:02:55.600> work<00:02:55.870> out<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:57.070> was<00:02:57.250> only

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
it just did not work out and I was only

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.270 
it just did not work out and I was only
able<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.940> do<00:02:58.270> just<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.140> one<00:02:59.350> row<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.680> elastic

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
able to do just the one row of elastic

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580 
able to do just the one row of elastic
so<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.330> went<00:03:01.540> ahead<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.780> made<00:03:01.959> sure<00:03:02.350> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
so I just went ahead and made sure that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.620 
so I just went ahead and made sure that
I<00:03:02.650> did<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:03.130> elastic<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.730> little<00:03:04.090> bit<00:03:04.240> tighter

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
I did the elastic a little bit tighter

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.380 
I did the elastic a little bit tighter
than<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.230> normally<00:03:05.290> would<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:07.209> that

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
than I normally would have and so that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.000 
than I normally would have and so that
way<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.660> case<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:08.050> did<00:03:08.200> stretch<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> little<00:03:08.860> bit

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
way in case it did stretch a little bit

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.030 
way in case it did stretch a little bit
it<00:03:09.220> still<00:03:09.580> would<00:03:10.090> hold<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> skirt<00:03:10.720> up<00:03:10.900> okay<00:03:11.709> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
it still would hold the skirt up okay so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.760 
it still would hold the skirt up okay so
almost<00:03:12.550> finished<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.660> last<00:03:14.140> thing<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.560> had<00:03:14.680> to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
almost finished the last thing I had to

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.430 
almost finished the last thing I had to
do<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.640> trim<00:03:16.360> up<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.780> hemline<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
do was to trim up the hemline of the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.050 
do was to trim up the hemline of the
skirt<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.100> make<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.640> shape<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.880> I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
skirt and make it the shape that I

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.990 
skirt and make it the shape that I
wanted<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.630> folded<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.830> front<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.400> half<00:03:21.640> and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
wanted so I folded the front in half and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.570 
wanted so I folded the front in half and
trim<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.080> curve<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.620> fold<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> back<00:03:24.400> in

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
trim the curve and fold in the back in

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.550 
trim the curve and fold in the back in
half<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.970> trim<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.330> curve<00:03:25.630> tried<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.470> on

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
half and trim that curve tried it on

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.380 
half and trim that curve tried it on
make<00:03:26.800> sure<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> liked<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.519> tweaked<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> little

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
make sure I liked it tweaked it a little

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.830 
make sure I liked it tweaked it a little
bit<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.320> then<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:29.920> needed<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.580> hem<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.300> hate

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
bit and then I needed to hem it I hate

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.680 
bit and then I needed to hem it I hate
hemming<00:03:32.380> curves<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.340> watched<00:03:33.610> my<00:03:33.970> hooded

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
hemming curves if you watched my hooded

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.370 
hemming curves if you watched my hooded
capelet<00:03:35.080> video<00:03:35.350> I<00:03:35.410> put<00:03:35.650> up<00:03:35.709> recently<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
capelet video I put up recently I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.930 
capelet video I put up recently I
mentioned<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.470> in<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.010> hate<00:03:39.400> hemming

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.759 
mentioned it in that but I hate hemming
curves<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.600> figured<00:03:40.989> out<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> little<00:03:41.380> cheat

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
curves so I figured out a little cheat

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.699 
curves so I figured out a little cheat
what<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.790> did<00:03:43.120> was<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.390> took<00:03:43.540> some<00:03:43.780> lace<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.440> I

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
what I did was I took some lace and I

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.259 
what I did was I took some lace and I
put<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.160> right<00:03:45.370> sides<00:03:45.610> together<00:03:45.790> with<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
put it right sides together with the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
put it right sides together with the
fabric<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.780> sewed<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.680> on<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.239> then<00:03:49.239> I

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
fabric and sewed it on and then I

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.580 
fabric and sewed it on and then I
flipped<00:03:50.739> it<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.820> was<00:03:52.060> right<00:03:52.660> sides<00:03:52.959> out<00:03:53.200> and

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
flipped it so it was right sides out and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.330 
flipped it so it was right sides out and
just<00:03:54.400> top<00:03:54.580> stitched<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.680> looks<00:03:56.980> really

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
just top stitched it and it looks really

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.850 
just top stitched it and it looks really
cute<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.820> has<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.970> nice<00:03:58.239> finished<00:03:58.690> look<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.709> I

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
cute it has a nice finished look but I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.150 
cute it has a nice finished look but I
didn't<00:04:00.519> have<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.910> actually<00:04:01.510> do<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.350> proper<00:04:02.860> him

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
didn't have to actually do a proper him

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.360 
didn't have to actually do a proper him
and<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.150> was<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.870> much<00:04:05.140> quicker<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:05.860> much

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
and so it was so much quicker so much

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.680 
and so it was so much quicker so much
nicer<00:04:06.730> looking<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.390> lot<00:04:07.750> less<00:04:08.290> aggravation

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
nicer looking and a lot less aggravation

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.900 
nicer looking and a lot less aggravation
so<00:04:10.690> that<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.830> I<00:04:11.890> love<00:04:12.280> how<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.580> skirt

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.670 
looks with my damsel corset it the
skirts<00:04:16.030> a<00:04:16.180> little<00:04:16.419> bit<00:04:16.660> bulky<00:04:17.019> up<00:04:17.140> top<00:04:17.410> with

skirts a little bit bulky up top with

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.020

the<00:04:17.799> gathering<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.340> everything<00:04:18.729> but<00:04:18.910> the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
the gathering and everything but the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.140 
the gathering and everything but the
corset<00:04:19.510> hides<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.049> perfectly<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.640> can't

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
corset hides that perfectly so you can't

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.180 
corset hides that perfectly so you can't
even<00:04:22.300> tell<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.630> there<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:23.289> extra<00:04:23.860> bulk<00:04:24.130> there

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190
