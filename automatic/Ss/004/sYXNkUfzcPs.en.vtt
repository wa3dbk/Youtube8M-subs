00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.430
 it's a place to say we're afraid we're 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.050
 gone for the second episode of 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.160
 bombs binent plant id today 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.450
 we are on two is a language that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.440
 I did not want to do in the first 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.580
 episode just for you 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.410
 show something that changes a little 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.000
 both unfortunately it's a mop 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.350
 hyper play but so everyone 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.570
 knows pretty much the things that to 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.700
 do it so I think it should go 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.160
 quite quickly the first break that often 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.960
 used it's the break for the ga for 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.850
 the hole we can plant here and so 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.170
 we are going to stick against this wall is that 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.180
 still interesting breaks 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.410
 of course to defend so the better 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.820
 it's being in the hole because there 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.940
 you are really really good at 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.380
 covered to kill the guy who broadcasts the 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.180
 small variation possible is in his 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.770
 stairs but there the difference of the hole 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.400
 you are really a little more exposed 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.710
 by all the guys who are on the site at 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.970
 the other pose that is interesting 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.620
 according to me it's the news that is 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.180
 possible since the time stay of d2 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.979
 it is by planting in this area 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.689
 that's against this crate is there we 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.340
 plant to cover by extending the 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.720
 cornice 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.939
 it's about the same as the guy ga 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.689
 is hyper discovered when they count 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.960
 spreads the bomb 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.159
 so that's a really easy target there 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.600
 there are breaks of course that we find 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.509
 often but not terribly 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.189
 it's the break for example here or here 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.689
 so that's exactly how I am 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.579
 finally I had already spoken to you yes 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.679
 we are very safe we ​​are very 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.240
 covered when we plant but the guy who 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.609
 diffuse and just as much undercover and so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.049
 it's not really interesting in terro 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.549
 before going to 6b the last break 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.049
 that I find nice is the break here 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.569
 well, but that's okay 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.890
 important the guy who even broadcasts the 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.469
 time a group i it is almost jet 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.670
 to expose dupont was so there 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.020
 it's the same you put company you 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.149
 wait for the guy who goes through korn or 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.979
 by the ga and when that diffuses you hop 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.810
 go get it here or in the worst 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.039
 cases you go ahead and there you 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.630
 are obliged to see him overtaking during 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.639
 that they broadcast it's a pretty kind 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.020
 easy and especially that on during your 

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:01.420
 opponents what it's not it's not 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.090
 often we see that at the site 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 b to find just about as 3 pose 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.080
 so the most interesting its outlines 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.759
 often it's here in this corner you're 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.440
 covered enough that in general we did not see 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.880
 that a wing so the tunnel and safe and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.010
 you are not exposed to the door or 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.840
 the fight is there or plants here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.209
 the advantage is that we can still cover 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 once in the tunnel quite easily 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.750
 that 's tunnel cover of course we're 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.430
 dipped and do that in the corner one can 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 to shift a little bit is the same thing 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 that you are just a little less safe 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 but it's just as effective at 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.189
 other poses that are often found 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 it's a break for example here we 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.060
 try but personally I'm not 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.040
 very fan of this break simply 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
 because there is always one is always 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.250
 covered with something already 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 tunnel if the guy who says what she wants 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.909
 well against the wall it may not be 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.519
 visible then played with us if we are 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.409
 if we owe the ports just as much hunger or 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.540
 separate windows the guy can be 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.980
 covered and well plan that diffuses so 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420
 I'm not very fan of this 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.859
 pause 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 this break here is probably the worst 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.379
 possible 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.970
 I really do not recommend the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.560
 ok sphere you carried your bomb 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.049
 but the guy he without him that emanates 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.609
 smoky spreading his stuff nobody ever 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.459
 will go get it what is it really 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.659
 it's too risky to plant here 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.079
 small exotic skins that are 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.519
 possible it is on this vote more 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.500
 is that the guy who broadcasts and is 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.359
 standing against this piece ie 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.909
 relatively uncovered compared to 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.440
 any site be on the box 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.849
 downright and then that's really 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.980
 it's pigeon shooting 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.769
 in the same kind you have to know that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.209
 we can plant on this wall and on 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.060
 about the whole length I believe 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.739
 so far here we can no longer but there we 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.410
 can then pretty much just that so much 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.819
 she tac b therefore there is the same 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.889
 same advantage as on this piece 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.510
 the guy who broadcasts and necessarily stands up to 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.190
 share here if you plant in this corner there 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.569
 since there it is high enough and 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.970
 vlad and that he is below that 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.709
 blocks the diffuse so he is obliged 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.930
 to be either standing and therefore enough to 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.150
 discovered either on the wall and again 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.709
 once pigeon shooting 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.260
 listen I think I've been around 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.949
 sites of the poses of bombs 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.629
 interesting 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.549
 see you in a few days for a 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.150
 next episode hoping that this 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.150
 video you and more
