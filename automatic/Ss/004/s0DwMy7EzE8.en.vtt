shipping<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.750> excited<00:00:34.260> about<00:00:34.320> it

only cost me 25 bucks so I think it was

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.250 
only cost me 25 bucks so I think it was
a<00:00:38.940> great<00:00:39.270> deal<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.020> ounce<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.590> silver

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.220 

you<00:00:49.160> can<00:00:49.310> see<00:00:49.490> there<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.880> eagle

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.890 

everything<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.840> very<00:00:55.840> detailed<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.720> nice

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
everything is very detailed it's a nice

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.440 
everything is very detailed it's a nice
looking<00:00:59.230> piece<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.829> silver<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.879> bigger<00:01:01.090> bars

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
looking piece of silver the bigger bars

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.410 
looking piece of silver the bigger bars
do<00:01:01.750> look<00:01:01.989> more<00:01:02.020> detailed<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:03.190> um<00:01:03.340> I<00:01:03.640> guess

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
do look more detailed but um I guess

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.390 
do look more detailed but um I guess
that's<00:01:04.659> because<00:01:04.780> they<00:01:05.710> have<00:01:05.860> more<00:01:06.040> room<00:01:06.250> on

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
that's because they have more room on

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.120 
that's because they have more room on
them<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:08.140> things<00:01:08.440> are<00:01:08.680> bigger<00:01:08.920> you

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
them and when things are bigger you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.830 
them and when things are bigger you
could<00:01:09.280> put<00:01:09.490> some<00:01:09.700> more<00:01:09.820> details<00:01:10.300> into<00:01:10.600> the
