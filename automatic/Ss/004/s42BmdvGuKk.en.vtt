one too and make a row out of that and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.109 
one too and make a row out of that and
leave<00:01:40.639> it<00:01:40.880> aside<00:01:41.799> once<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.099> prepare<00:01:43.639> the<00:01:43.849> roll

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
it looks like this like a sticky dough

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.409 
it looks like this like a sticky dough
so<00:01:47.749> if<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.619> want<00:01:48.889> you<00:01:49.099> can<00:01:49.340> do<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:50.060> they

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:50.419 
so if you want you can do this that they

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.569 
so if you want you can do this that they
a<00:01:50.659> head<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.229> leave<00:01:51.469> it<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.799> fridge<00:01:52.189> for

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
a head and leave it in the fridge for

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.419 
a head and leave it in the fridge for
several<00:01:53.450> hours<00:01:53.959> or<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:55.249> leave<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.549> outside

several hours or just leave it outside

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.199 
several hours or just leave it outside
this<00:01:58.429> will<00:01:58.989> start<00:01:59.989> bubbling<00:02:00.439> up<00:02:00.859> once<00:02:01.819> they

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
this will start bubbling up once they

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.149 
this will start bubbling up once they
come<00:02:02.569> to<00:02:02.719> that<00:02:02.749> stage<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.469> am<00:02:03.529> going<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.859> do<00:02:04.009> the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
come to that stage I am going to do the

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.849 
come to that stage I am going to do the
rest<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.729> recipe<00:02:05.209> so<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:06.020> first<00:02:06.319> dough<00:02:06.619> is

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
rest of the recipe so the first dough is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.250 
rest of the recipe so the first dough is
ready<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.549> bubbly<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:09.200> any<00:02:09.470> last

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
going to need this on low speed about
