00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that was a bit too big so I'm just going

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.520 
that was a bit too big so I'm just going
to<00:02:13.170> use<00:02:13.290> my

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to use my

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
to use my
little<00:02:13.709> pearly<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.670> well<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.209> not<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.420> pearl

but<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.230> kind<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> has<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.620> texture<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.250> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
but it kind of has that texture to it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.670 
but it kind of has that texture to it
and<00:02:17.580> I'm<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> clip<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
stick out so that kind of does a good

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.710 
stick out so that kind of does a good
job<00:02:31.500> keeping<00:02:31.950> them<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.280> any<00:02:32.430> way<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.690> way

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
job keeping them in any way and that way

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.420 
job keeping them in any way and that way
like<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.350> clipping<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.830> hair<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.190> but

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
like it's clipping the hair back but

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
like it's clipping the hair back but
it's<00:02:35.580> also<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.830> extending<00:02:37.830> further<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
it's also like extending further and I

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.580 
it's also like extending further and I
think<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.720> looks<00:02:39.750> kinda<00:02:39.989> cute<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
think it looks kinda cute and I just

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
think it looks kinda cute and I just
sprayed<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.890> again<00:02:41.130> make<00:02:41.790> sure<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.090> really

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
sprayed it again make sure it really

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.760 
sprayed it again make sure it really
stays<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.600> little<00:02:42.840> working<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> rest<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
stays a little working with the rest of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.920 
stays a little working with the rest of
my<00:02:43.860> hair<00:02:44.239> all<00:02:45.239> right<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> jump

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
my hair all right so I'm going to jump

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.330 
my hair all right so I'm going to jump
right<00:02:45.989> over<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> other<00:02:46.590> side<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.950> my<00:02:47.160> hair

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
right over to the other side of my hair

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.300 
right over to the other side of my hair
and<00:02:47.989> I'm<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.260> gonna<00:02:49.410> curl<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:49.980> using<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
and I'm just gonna curl it using the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.400 
and I'm just gonna curl it using the
clamp<00:02:50.640> outwards<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.300> basically<00:02:51.870> how<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.019> use

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
clamp outwards so basically how you use

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.290 
clamp outwards so basically how you use
a<00:02:52.440> curling<00:02:52.860> iron<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.519> think<00:02:53.730> pretty<00:02:54.180> much

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
a curling iron like I think pretty much

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.170 
a curling iron like I think pretty much
anyone<00:02:54.810> could<00:02:55.019> do<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.610> think<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.700> even<00:02:56.850> says

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
anyone could do it I think it even says

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.930 
anyone could do it I think it even says
the<00:02:57.360> instructions<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.080> box<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.910> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
the instructions on the box and it is a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.280 
the instructions on the box and it is a
bit<00:03:00.269> zoomed<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.720> but<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.050> pretty<00:03:01.200> much

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
bit zoomed in but you can pretty much

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860 
bit zoomed in but you can pretty much
see<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:01.769> I'm<00:03:01.860> doing<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:03.269> little<00:03:03.569> pieces<00:03:03.690> of

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
see what I'm doing it's little pieces of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.180 
see what I'm doing it's little pieces of

for<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.200> next<00:04:08.590> side<00:04:09.030> instead<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.090> doing<00:04:10.900> what

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
for the next side instead of doing what

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.420 
for the next side instead of doing what
you<00:04:11.140> did<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.500> other<00:04:11.650> bit<00:04:11.890> or<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.280> other

you did for the other bit or the other

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.280 
you did for the other bit or the other
side<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.030> don't<00:04:13.360> know<00:04:13.420> what<00:04:13.540> aspects<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:14.050> video

side I don't know what aspects a video
you're<00:04:14.950> going<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.160> turn<00:04:15.280> them<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.880> this

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
you're going to turn them in and this

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.330 
you're going to turn them in and this
works<00:04:16.840> out<00:04:16.959> well<00:04:17.140> because<00:04:17.350> that's<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.920> way<00:04:17.950> it

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
works out well because that's the way it

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.949 
works out well because that's the way it
actually<00:04:18.549> works<00:04:19.270> with<00:04:19.420> my<00:04:19.540> curling<00:04:19.780> iron

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
actually works with my curling iron

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.280 
actually works with my curling iron
anyway<00:04:20.380> like<00:04:20.680> since<00:04:21.340> I'm<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.640> right-handed

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
anyway like since I'm like right-handed

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.310 
anyway like since I'm like right-handed
it<00:04:23.290> makes<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.680> easier<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:24.310> me<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:25.320> they're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it makes it easier for me to and they're

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.620 
it makes it easier for me to and they're
not<00:04:26.470> gonna<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.880> bouncing<00:04:27.880> along<00:04:28.240> your<00:04:28.450> face

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
not gonna like bouncing along your face

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.720 
not gonna like bouncing along your face
because<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.020> bought<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.290> clip<00:04:29.470> back<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.100> it's

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
because you bought it clip back so it's

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.390 
because you bought it clip back so it's
a<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.060> nice<00:04:31.450> kind<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.840> like<00:04:31.960> balance<00:04:32.440> and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
a really nice kind of like balance and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.920 
a really nice kind of like balance and
that's<00:04:33.550> why<00:04:33.730> I'm<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:33.940> able<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.390> let<00:04:34.480> curl<00:04:34.720> it

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that's why I'm like able to let curl it

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.460 
that's why I'm like able to let curl it
