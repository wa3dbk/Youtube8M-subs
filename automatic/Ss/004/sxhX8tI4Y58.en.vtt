00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
classmates say go to the nucleolus so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.399 
classmates say go to the nucleolus so
that<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.939> correct<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.960> find<00:01:13.229> the

that is correct go and find the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.760 
that is correct go and find the
nucleolus<00:01:14.299> very<00:01:15.299> good<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> nucleolus<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
nucleolus very good the nucleolus is a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
nucleolus very good the nucleolus is a
specialized<00:01:17.340> region<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> nucleus<00:01:18.750> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
specialized region in the nucleus that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
specialized region in the nucleus that's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.610 
ribosomes are kind of tricky we have a
bunch<00:02:46.389> of<00:02:46.510> different<00:02:46.810> kinds<00:02:47.139> of<00:02:47.200> ribosomes

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
bunch of different kinds of ribosomes

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.319 
bunch of different kinds of ribosomes
okay<00:02:48.659> so<00:02:49.659> we<00:02:50.109> have<00:02:50.639> okay<00:02:51.639> very<00:02:51.790> good<00:02:51.909> she's

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
okay so we have okay very good she's

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.910 
okay so we have okay very good she's
found<00:02:52.629> two<00:02:52.780> ribosome<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.470> doing<00:02:53.739> what

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
found two ribosome that's doing what

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.190 
found two ribosome that's doing what
what<00:02:54.159> kind<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.370> protein<00:02:54.579> is<00:02:54.879> this<00:02:55.030> making

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.289 

cytoplasmic<00:02:59.200> protein<00:03:00.040> because<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.849> bound

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
cytoplasmic protein because it is bound

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.530 
cytoplasmic protein because it is bound
to<00:03:01.540> anem<00:03:01.900> RNA<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:03.189> large<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.790> small<00:03:03.970> subunits

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
to anem RNA the large and small subunits

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.289 
to anem RNA the large and small subunits
are<00:03:04.629> together<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.250> not<00:03:06.609> on<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> rough

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
are together and it's not on the rough

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.929 
are together and it's not on the rough
endoplasmic<00:03:07.450> reticulum<00:03:08.439> now<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:09.549> she<00:03:09.790> was

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
endoplasmic reticulum now if she was

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.509 
endoplasmic reticulum now if she was
making<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.629> here<00:03:11.109> is<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:13.709> large<00:03:14.709> subunit<00:03:15.010> in<00:03:15.430> a

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
making and here is a large subunit in a

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.270 
making and here is a large subunit in a
small<00:03:15.790> subunit<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.540> they're<00:03:17.109> not<00:03:18.040> together

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
small subunit and they're not together

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.879 
small subunit and they're not together
because<00:03:18.790> they're<00:03:18.940> not<00:03:19.120> bound<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.720> an<00:03:19.900> mRNA<00:03:20.530> and

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
because they're not bound to an mRNA and

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.879 
because they're not bound to an mRNA and
then<00:03:21.519> we<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.329> ribosome<00:03:23.199> over<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.680> that's

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
then we have a ribosome over here that's

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.009 
then we have a ribosome over here that's
making<00:03:24.310> what<00:03:24.489> type<00:03:24.699> of<00:03:24.730> protein<00:03:27.720> secreted<00:03:28.720> or

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
making what type of protein secreted or

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.819 
making what type of protein secreted or
transmembrane<00:03:29.530> absolutely<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.090> now<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.829> today

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
transmembrane absolutely so now I today

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.800 
transmembrane absolutely so now I today
is<00:03:33.099> I'm<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.609> to<00:03:33.730> be<00:03:33.849> your<00:03:34.000> motor<00:03:34.239> protein

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
is I'm going to be your motor protein

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.789 
is I'm going to be your motor protein
and<00:03:35.139> I<00:03:35.769> am<00:03:35.919> going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.400> move<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.799> secreted

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
and I am going to move a secreted

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.240 
and I am going to move a secreted
protein<00:03:39.280> that's<00:03:39.519> made<00:03:39.909> from<00:03:40.389> in<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.620> rough<00:03:42.010> ER

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
protein that's made from in the rough ER

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.569 
protein that's made from in the rough ER
and<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.959> I'm<00:03:44.199> going<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.409> have<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.560> move<00:03:45.129> along

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
and then I'm going to have to move along

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.979 
and then I'm going to have to move along
what<00:03:46.269> type<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.569> track<00:03:48.690> microtubules<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.870> I'm

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
what type of track microtubules and I'm

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.430 
what type of track microtubules and I'm
going<00:03:50.109> to<00:03:50.139> carry<00:03:50.379> this<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.919> what<00:03:51.129> structure

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
going to carry this to what structure

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.839 
going to carry this to what structure
Golgi<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:53.799> my<00:03:54.010> goal<00:03:54.250> G<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.549> going<00:03:54.760> to

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
Golgi and then my goal G is going to

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.819 
Golgi and then my goal G is going to
have<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.169> squish<00:03:56.169> it<00:03:56.319> up<00:03:56.440> together<00:03:56.590> and

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
have to squish it up together and

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.909 
have to squish it up together and
process<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.599> very<00:03:58.599> good<00:03:58.900> she's<00:03:59.260> processed<00:03:59.769> my

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
process it very good she's processed my

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.670 
process it very good she's processed my
protein<00:04:00.760> now<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.329> then<00:04:01.840> I<00:04:02.169> have<00:04:02.409> to<00:04:02.440> find

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
protein now and then I have to find

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.520 
protein now and then I have to find
another<00:04:02.829> microtubule<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.209> step<00:04:04.449> on<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:05.199> go<00:04:05.319> out

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
another microtubule to step on to go out

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.409 
another microtubule to step on to go out
and<00:04:05.769> take<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.400> plasma<00:04:06.639> membrane<00:04:06.879> and

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
and take it to the plasma membrane and

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.610 
and take it to the plasma membrane and
then<00:04:07.569> what<00:04:07.750> happens<00:04:08.169> when<00:04:08.319> i<00:04:08.349> get<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.590> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
then what happens when i get to the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.520 
then what happens when i get to the
plasma<00:04:08.979> membrane<00:04:10.590> exocytosis<00:04:12.629> ok<00:04:13.629> and<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.319> we

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
plasma membrane exocytosis ok and so we

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.219 
plasma membrane exocytosis ok and so we
exercised<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.180> was<00:04:16.810> your<00:04:17.019> motor

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
exercised and so I was your motor

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:23.790 
exercised and so I was your motor
protein<00:04:18.299> what<00:04:19.299> motor<00:04:19.750> protein<00:04:20.440> was<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:22.800> last

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
protein what motor protein was I last

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.200 
protein what motor protein was I last
question

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.779
