this<00:00:00.120> video<00:00:00.450> will<00:00:00.659> give<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:00.900> demonstration<00:00:01.140> of

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this video will give a demonstration of

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.430 
this video will give a demonstration of
why<00:00:02.310> it's<00:00:02.700> profitable<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.540> be<00:00:03.689> aggressive<00:00:04.200> in

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
why it's profitable to be aggressive in

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:18.480 
why it's profitable to be aggressive in
no-limit<00:00:05.190> hold'em

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.700 

in<00:00:19.000> this<00:00:19.240> hand<00:00:19.510> I've<00:00:19.660> been<00:00:19.690> dealt<00:00:19.869> king<00:00:20.440> 10

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
in this hand I've been dealt king 10

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.460 
in this hand I've been dealt king 10
which<00:00:21.550> is<00:00:21.580> definitely<00:00:22.449> a<00:00:22.750> good<00:00:22.990> starting

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
which is definitely a good starting

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.620 
which is definitely a good starting
hands<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:24.220> to<00:00:25.060> raise<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.619> cut<00:00:26.770> off<00:00:27.630> and

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
hands to to raise in the cut off and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.510 
hands to to raise in the cut off and
considering<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.439> short<00:00:29.770> stack<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.099> linked<00:00:30.400> in

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
considering a short stack is linked in

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.569 
considering a short stack is linked in
I'll<00:00:30.820> make<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> raise

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.520 

now<00:00:37.999> the<00:00:38.059> great<00:00:38.300> thing<00:00:38.329> about<00:00:38.570> making<00:00:39.019> squeeze

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
now the great thing about making squeeze

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.310 
now the great thing about making squeeze
plays<00:00:39.829> is<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:41.030> can<00:00:41.269> either<00:00:41.510> get<00:00:41.780> them<00:00:41.929> to<00:00:42.079> fold

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
plays is you can either get them to fold

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.340 
plays is you can either get them to fold
preflop<00:00:42.859> or<00:00:43.359> you<00:00:44.359> take<00:00:44.600> control<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.170> hand

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
preflop or you take control of the hand

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.639 
preflop or you take control of the hand
post<00:00:45.589> flop<00:00:46.089> now<00:00:47.089> in<00:00:47.299> these<00:00:47.449> hands<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.229> big

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
post flop now in these hands the big

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.930 
post flop now in these hands the big
client<00:00:49.100> has<00:00:49.250> decided<00:00:49.729> to<00:00:49.850> just<00:00:50.030> call<00:00:50.299> my<00:00:50.870> raise

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
client has decided to just call my raise

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.929 
client has decided to just call my raise
and<00:00:52.940> I've<00:00:53.539> flopped<00:00:54.439> a<00:00:54.710> gutshot<00:00:55.039> straight<00:00:55.280> so

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:55.939 
and I've flopped a gutshot straight so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.240 
and I've flopped a gutshot straight so
I'll<00:00:56.269> make<00:00:56.329> a<00:00:56.600> bit<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.530> flop<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:57.979> try<00:00:58.129> and

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I'll make a bit of the flop and try and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.039 
I'll make a bit of the flop and try and
take<00:00:58.369> your<00:00:58.489> down<00:00:58.609> straight<00:00:58.850> away<00:00:58.879> but<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.899> big

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
take your down straight away but the big

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.250 
take your down straight away but the big
blind<00:01:00.229> is<00:01:00.379> just<00:01:00.559> called<00:01:01.780> so<00:01:02.780> they've<00:01:02.989> probably

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
blind is just called so they've probably

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.060 
blind is just called so they've probably
got<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> ACE<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.429> they've<00:01:05.390> checked<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.780> turn

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
got the ACE and they've checked the turn

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.910 
got the ACE and they've checked the turn
so<00:01:07.070> I'll<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.549> take<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.030> free<00:01:08.210> card<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
so I'll just take the free card and the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.219 
so I'll just take the free card and the
great<00:01:10.220> card<00:01:10.729> has<00:01:10.909> come<00:01:11.119> on<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.330> river<00:01:11.630> giving

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
great card has come on the river giving

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.380 
great card has come on the river giving
me<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.590> night<00:01:13.340> straight<00:01:15.729> now<00:01:16.729> considering

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
me the night straight now considering

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.630 
me the night straight now considering
the<00:01:17.479> big<00:01:17.630> blind<00:01:17.810> probably<00:01:18.319> has<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.649> ACE<00:01:18.860> they

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
the big blind probably has the ACE they

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.940 
the big blind probably has the ACE they
could<00:01:19.850> very<00:01:20.179> likely<00:01:20.299> have<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> two<00:01:21.259> pair<00:01:21.530> tie

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
could very likely have the two pair tie

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.590 
could very likely have the two pair tie
pins<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:23.119> spot<00:01:23.330> as<00:01:23.479> well<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:25.390> you<00:01:26.390> want<00:01:26.509> to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
pins in this spot as well so you want to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.740 
pins in this spot as well so you want to
keep<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.899> in<00:01:27.140> mind<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:27.679> making<00:01:28.750> when

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
keep that in mind when making when

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.749 
keep that in mind when making when
deciding<00:01:30.020> what<00:01:30.500> size<00:01:30.890> are<00:01:30.920> raised<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.429> put<00:01:31.640> in

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
deciding what size are raised to put in

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.899 
deciding what size are raised to put in
on<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.000> river<00:01:33.130> usually<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.159> three<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.700> four

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
on the river usually a three to four

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.249 
on the river usually a three to four
times<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:36.850> that<00:01:37.850> either<00:01:38.179> is<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.780> nice<00:01:39.049> size

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
times and that either is a nice size

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.650 
times and that either is a nice size
raise<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.250> i'll<00:01:40.670> probably<00:01:40.850> get<00:01:41.270> paid<00:01:41.479> off

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
raise and i'll probably get paid off

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.319 
raise and i'll probably get paid off
with<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> Nazi
