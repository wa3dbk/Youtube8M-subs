00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.540 

because<00:01:43.320> people<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.770> more<00:01:43.890> information<00:01:44.160> do

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
because people have more information do

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.250 
because people have more information do
you<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.270> more<00:01:45.510> about<00:01:45.600> intelligent

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
you think it's more about intelligent

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.290 
you think it's more about intelligent
beauty<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.550> much<00:01:47.730> easier<00:01:48.060> for

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
beauty now I think it's much easier for

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.230 
beauty now I think it's much easier for
the<00:01:48.510> customer<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:48.990> drive<00:01:49.410> trends<00:01:50.400> much<00:01:50.820> easier

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the customer to drive trends much easier

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.430 
the customer to drive trends much easier
because<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.540> someone<00:01:51.840> talks<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.230> it

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
because if someone talks about it

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.870 
because if someone talks about it
everyone<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.980> pay<00:01:53.100> attention<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:53.670> jump

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
everyone has to pay attention and jump

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
everyone has to pay attention and jump
to<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.690> much<00:01:55.020> harder<00:01:55.230> for<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.560> brand<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
to it it's much harder for a brand to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.890 
to it it's much harder for a brand to
dictate<00:01:56.610> what's<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.360> trend<00:01:57.600> in

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
dictate what's going to be a trend in

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.350 
dictate what's going to be a trend in
this<00:01:58.020> era<00:01:58.260> definitely<00:01:58.980> its<00:01:59.550> anti-aging<00:01:59.910> hair

woman at how to put a lipstick on she

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.360 
woman at how to put a lipstick on she
might<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.500> more<00:02:22.709> interested<00:02:23.160> in<00:02:23.250> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
might be more interested in the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.130 
might be more interested in the
ingredients<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> fact<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.720> there's

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
ingredients or the fact that there's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.590 
ingredients or the fact that there's
some<00:02:25.440> clever<00:02:26.190> way<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.060> lipsticks<00:02:27.420> been

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
some clever way the lipsticks been

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.050 
some clever way the lipsticks been
packaged<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:28.980> some<00:02:29.250> collaboration

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060

that's<00:02:30.390> happened<00:02:30.870> between<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.200> designer<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.800> a

that's happened between a designer and a
beauty<00:02:32.280> house<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.209> think<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.600> sort<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
beauty house and I think it sort of

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.960 
beauty house and I think it sort of
reflects<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> fact<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.890> everybody<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:35.820> much

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
reflects the fact that everybody so much

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.970 
reflects the fact that everybody so much
more<00:02:36.150> savvy<00:02:36.390> about<00:02:36.660> beauty<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.440> we've<00:02:37.709> become

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
more savvy about beauty now we've become

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.650 
more savvy about beauty now we've become
much<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.370> sophisticated<00:02:38.580> than<00:02:39.240> we<00:02:39.480> ever

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
much more sophisticated than we ever

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.959
