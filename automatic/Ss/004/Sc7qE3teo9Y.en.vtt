with was trying to fit the retractable
leash<00:01:59.510> down<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.440> fit<00:02:00.680> size

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.700 

the<00:02:03.590> least<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.009> want

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the least you want

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.279 
the least you want
sorry<00:02:05.400> I

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.199 

so<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.099> one<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.429> final<00:02:09.729> prototypes

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
so this is one of the final prototypes

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.350 
so this is one of the final prototypes
that<00:02:10.330> we<00:02:10.509> have<00:02:10.689> it's<00:02:11.650> pretty<00:02:12.579> small

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
that we have it's pretty small

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.660 
that we have it's pretty small
as<00:02:13.659> long<00:02:13.810> as<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:14.349> simple<00:02:14.799> which<00:02:15.489> will

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
as long as really simple which will

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.940 
as long as really simple which will
sleep<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.720> slip<00:02:16.959> your<00:02:17.110> hand<00:02:17.319> through<00:02:17.530> here

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
sleep you slip your hand through here

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.259 
sleep you slip your hand through here
so<00:02:18.579> basically<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.720> kept<00:02:20.019> our<00:02:20.530> initial<00:02:21.269> for

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
so basically we kept our initial for

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.899 
so basically we kept our initial for

right here where you put the dog waste
bags<00:02:32.079> I<00:02:32.620> think<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.430> mean<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.700> was<00:02:33.849> really

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
bags I think this I mean I was really

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
bags I think this I mean I was really
going<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.239> push<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.540> forward<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.019> really<00:02:35.109> an

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
going to push it forward it's really an

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.130 
going to push it forward it's really an
interesting<00:02:36.099> design<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:37.329> my<00:02:37.569> opinion<00:02:37.840> is

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
interesting design it in my opinion is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.339 
interesting design it in my opinion is
going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.739> one<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.129> most<00:02:39.450> sign

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.039 

that's<00:02:43.920> our<00:02:44.099> ultimate<00:02:44.280> quirky<00:02:45.030> dog<00:02:45.540> leash
