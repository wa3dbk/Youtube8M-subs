really<00:03:40.889> social<00:03:48.799> few<00:03:49.799> shots<00:03:50.009> here

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.990 

so<00:03:56.240> these<00:03:56.600> birds<00:03:56.870> if<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.830> if<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.880> have

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
so these birds if you have if you have

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.650 
so these birds if you have if you have
kids<00:03:59.980> or<00:04:00.980> small<00:04:01.459> children<00:04:01.880> near<00:04:02.390> them<00:04:02.540> that

kids or small children near them that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.480 
kids or small children near them that
probably<00:04:02.930> wouldn't<00:04:03.170> be<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.319> good<00:04:03.380> idea<00:04:03.590> because

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
probably wouldn't be a good idea because

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.590 
probably wouldn't be a good idea because
they<00:04:05.620> they're<00:04:06.620> very<00:04:06.650> breakable<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:09.880> or<00:04:10.880> if<00:04:11.510> you

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
they they're very breakable so or if you

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.820 
they they're very breakable so or if you
just<00:04:11.630> have<00:04:11.870> kids<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:13.209> small<00:04:14.209> children<00:04:14.830> around

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
just have kids and small children around

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:23.860 
just have kids and small children around
then<00:04:16.790> just<00:04:17.090> keep<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.390> cage<00:04:17.600> locked<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:22.870> so

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
then just keep the cage locked and so

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.030 
then just keep the cage locked and so
