I'm always searching for new and unique
and<00:00:13.140> unusual<00:00:13.260> ways<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:14.220> finishing<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> edges

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
of my quilts and one of the best things

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.840 
of my quilts and one of the best things
I<00:00:18.660> found<00:00:18.960> recently<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.680> ripping<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.460> love<00:00:20.700> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
I found recently is ripping I love to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.450 
I found recently is ripping I love to
rip<00:00:21.029> stuff<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.800> ripping<00:00:22.800> fabric<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.340> be<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
rip stuff and ripping fabric can be a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
rip stuff and ripping fabric can be a
lot<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.700> fun<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.210> look<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.230> fabrics<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> are

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
lot of fun I look for fabrics that are

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.950 
lot of fun I look for fabrics that are
loosely<00:00:26.190> woven<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.820> fabrics<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> look<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
loosely woven in fabrics that look the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.260 
loosely woven in fabrics that look the
same<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.320> both<00:00:28.560> sides<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> woven<00:00:29.880> fabric

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
same on both sides so a woven fabric

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.910 
same on both sides so a woven fabric
that<00:00:30.300> doesn't<00:00:30.780> have<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> print<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.530> surface

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that doesn't have a print on the surface

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.150 
that doesn't have a print on the surface
is<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.850> best<00:00:33.059> bet<00:00:33.330> what<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.199> like<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.830> lot

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is the best bet what I like to use a lot

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.540 
is the best bet what I like to use a lot
of<00:00:35.190> our<00:00:35.520> shot<00:00:36.420> Cotton's<00:00:36.930> shot<00:00:37.680> cotton<00:00:38.010> has<00:00:38.190> one

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
of our shot Cotton's shot cotton has one

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
of our shot Cotton's shot cotton has one
color<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.910> thread<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> warp<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.650> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
color of thread in the warp and a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.560 
color of thread in the warp and a
different<00:00:41.370> color<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.729> thread<00:00:41.909> in<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> weave

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
different color of thread in the weave

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.140 
different color of thread in the weave
so<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.710> yield<00:00:44.070> different<00:00:44.519> colors<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
so that you yield different colors when

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.140 
so that you yield different colors when
you<00:00:45.300> rip<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> fabric<00:00:46.309> these<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.550> made<00:00:47.729> by<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
you rip the fabric these are made by a

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.719 
you rip the fabric these are made by a
facet<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.140> they're<00:00:49.530> his<00:00:49.739> big<00:00:50.040> line<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.339> shot

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
facet and they're his big line of shot

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.140 
facet and they're his big line of shot
Cotton's<00:00:51.150> they<00:00:51.720> rip<00:00:52.019> really<00:00:52.260> nicely<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.150> on

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
Cotton's they rip really nicely and on

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.729 
Cotton's they rip really nicely and on
this<00:00:54.360> particular<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:55.049> we<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.409> see<00:00:55.589> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
this particular one we can see that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.399 
this particular one we can see that
we've<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> pale<00:00:56.489> pale<00:00:56.820> color<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.390> pink<00:00:58.140> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
on which way we rip the fabric we're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.509 
on which way we rip the fabric we're
going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> end<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.470> with<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.680> different<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.309> of

to take a lot of time either so I put an
iron-on<00:01:22.110> adhesive<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.980> back<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
iron-on adhesive on the back of this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.070 
iron-on adhesive on the back of this
orange<00:01:24.750> shot<00:01:25.320> cotton<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.180> ironed<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
orange shot cotton and ironed it so that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.650 
orange shot cotton and ironed it so that
it<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.230> covering<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.520> edge<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.940> the<00:01:30.060> back<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
it is covering the edge on the back and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.530 
it is covering the edge on the back and
we<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.440> this<00:01:31.560> raw<00:01:31.800> edge<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.670> pulled<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
we have this raw edge here and pulled it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.020 
we have this raw edge here and pulled it
around<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> front<00:01:34.230> before<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:35.430> ironed<00:01:35.910> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
around to the front before I ironed it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.720 
around to the front before I ironed it
down<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.480> front<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.020> inserted<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.980> piece<00:01:38.550> of

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
down to the front I inserted a piece of

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.670 
down to the front I inserted a piece of
this<00:01:38.880> fabric<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:39.450> had<00:01:39.600> been<00:01:39.780> ripped<00:01:40.050> so

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this fabric that had been ripped so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.020 
this fabric that had been ripped so
that's<00:01:40.920> what<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:41.250> seeing<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.910> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that's what you're seeing here with this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.060 
that's what you're seeing here with this
dark<00:01:42.300> purple<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> has

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
dark purple and you see here that it has

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.730 
dark purple and you see here that it has
this<00:01:44.460> deep<00:01:44.820> dark<00:01:45.150> blue<00:01:45.480> edge<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.260> that's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this deep dark blue edge and that's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.440 
this deep dark blue edge and that's
because<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.610> different<00:01:47.970> color<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
because it has that different color of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.260 
because it has that different color of
thread<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.200> warp<00:01:49.410> and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.620> weft<00:01:50.210> after<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thread in the warp and the weft after I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
thread in the warp and the weft after I
inserted<00:01:51.660> that<00:01:51.900> in<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.530> iron<00:01:52.860> down<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
inserted that in and then iron down the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.610 
inserted that in and then iron down the
orange<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.510> raw<00:01:54.659> edge<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.230> orange

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
orange I had the raw edge of the orange

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.890 
orange I had the raw edge of the orange
on<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.890> front<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.460> wanted<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> cover<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.870> I

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
on the front that I wanted to cover so I

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.200 
on the front that I wanted to cover so I
took<00:01:58.050> another<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.980> these<00:01:59.159> shot<00:01:59.730> Cotton's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
took another one of these shot Cotton's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.350 
took another one of these shot Cotton's
or<00:02:00.420> these<00:02:01.040> rippable<00:02:02.040> fabrics<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.850> ripped<00:02:03.120> it

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
or these rippable fabrics and ripped it

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
or these rippable fabrics and ripped it
and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:04.200> wound<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.740> really<00:02:05.190> really<00:02:05.460> tightly

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
and then wound it really really tightly

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.479 
and then wound it really really tightly
so<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.690> made<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.900> cord<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.680> then

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so that it kind of made a cord and then

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.240 
so that it kind of made a cord and then
I<00:02:08.610> couched<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.629> cord<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.560> cover<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.069> raw

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
I couched that cord on to cover the raw

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.880 
I couched that cord on to cover the raw
edge<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.690> binding<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.680> just

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
edge of the binding so it was just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.699 
edge of the binding so it was just
stitched<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:15.269> here<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.319> get<00:02:16.440> some

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
stitched on right here so we get some

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.800 
stitched on right here so we get some
fuzzy<00:02:17.159> bits<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.849> are<00:02:17.969> hanging<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.659> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
fuzzy bits that are hanging out of it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
fuzzy bits that are hanging out of it
and<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.469> of<00:02:19.530> has<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.920> kind<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> rough

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and it kind of has this kind of rough

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.330 
and it kind of has this kind of rough
look<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.290> ingenious<00:02:22.590> part<00:02:22.950> about

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
look to it the ingenious part about

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.520 
look to it the ingenious part about
was<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.760> fact<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.209> used<00:02:24.239> four<00:02:25.019> separate

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
was the fact that I used four separate

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.070 
was the fact that I used four separate
pieces<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.340> green<00:02:27.060> portion<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
pieces for that green portion here and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.140 
pieces for that green portion here and
left<00:02:28.769> them<00:02:29.010> long<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> hanging<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.879> each<00:02:30.000> of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
left them long and hanging in each of

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.059 
left them long and hanging in each of
the<00:02:30.239> corners<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:31.319> just<00:02:31.530> tie<00:02:31.769> them<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.010> a

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the corners and then just tie them in a

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.520 
the corners and then just tie them in a
knot<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.459> finish<00:02:32.700> them<00:02:32.849> off<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.140> quilt

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
knot to finish them off so as this quilt

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.830 
knot to finish them off so as this quilt
ages<00:02:35.010> these<00:02:35.640> fibers<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.360> continue

to Ravel a bit and they're going to be

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
to Ravel a bit and they're going to be
even<00:02:38.580> more<00:02:38.760> interesting<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.530> many

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
