00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello!

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.900
And thank you for reaching out 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.433
to be a part of our Young
African Leaders Initiative. 

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:07.667
I launched this effort because 

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.367
I believe that the future of
Africa 

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.633
will be defined by extraordinary
young people like you, 

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.400
and the United States wants to
be your partner. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.000
At our town halls at the White
House and in Soweto, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.033
and in my meetings with young
people across Africa, 

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.800
you’ve shown me that you have
the talent, 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.100
the drive, and the determination

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.000
to become the next generation of
African leaders. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.167
That’s the spirit behind our
Washington Fellowship program, 

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:34.533
which gives young Africans the
opportunity 

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.767
to come to America and develop
new skills and partnerships. 

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.633
To all of you—the nearly 50,000 who
applied—

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.067
I want you to know that I’ve
heard you. 

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.667
Your applications were
extraordinary. 

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:51.667
Your experiences, and your
vision for your communities 

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.067
and your countries, are an
inspiration. 

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:56.300
And as we go forward,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.600
we’re going to ensure that although we couldn't accept

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.033
everybody into the fellowship

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.633
there
will be opportunities

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.633
for each and every one of you

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.867
to somehow be involved.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.667
And that’s why today I’m excited

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.033
to announce the newest part of
our effort—

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.200
the Young African Leaders
Initiative Network. 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.767
And I’m asking each of you to
help lead the way. 

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:18.367
Because we’re already connected
with you, 

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.200
and we want to build our
relationship with you 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.333
into a network of young people
across Africa—

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.633
to share new ideas and to forge new
collaborations. 

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.333
Working together, we can build
the tools, 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.933
the training and technology you need
to become 

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.467
the next generation of leaders
in civil society, 

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.633
business and government. 

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:39.900
I want to hear from you on how
we can build this network. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.967
In the coming months, 

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.000
I’ll engage with you
directly—online and through
social media—

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.700
to hear your ideas and answer
your questions. 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.200
To learn more about how to
participate, 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.767
just go to YALI.state.gov 

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:56.567
That's Y-A-L-I dot state dot gov.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.700
I hope every single one of you
will join us. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.933
Because your countries need you.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.233
The world needs you. 

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:05.667
We need your imagination, your
optimism, and your idealism. 

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:06.800
And with this new network, 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.567
I know we can be partners for
decades to come. 

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:17.567
