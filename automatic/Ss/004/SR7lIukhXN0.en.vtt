00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:22.500
 antonio i do n't know why you don't think that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.590
 beyond the value of the bayern la juve 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.420
 have paid a little too much maybe 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 desire to be ready already 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 school seemed to never be in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 game 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 I repeat you beyond the value of the bayern 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 which is obvious however it never seemed 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.150
 the true juve only merit the opponents or 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 an attitude that may not have been 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:46.370
 that the right one for a series of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.370
 reasons I ask you no I don't think that 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.370
 that there was no attitude 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.660
 quite right 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:00.240
 I absolutely don't think today 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.150
 I feel I compliment Ho 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.260
 shake hands with angers because the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.180
 bathroom proved to be a team 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.650
 really very strong because it was there 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 need today to confirm 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.480
 however today's match has shown 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.480
 that the monk bayern 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.070
 it's a superpower like I said yesterday it is 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.570
 rightly among the favorites to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.410
 final victory with bayern but col 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.600
 barcelona real madrid is a team that 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.600
 it has very great very large individualities 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.330
 quality with the very physical team is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.060
 a team that also a very average age 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.610
 low therefore also runs a lot 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.680
 complete team a team that does not a 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.210
 case won is winning championship 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.490
 with 20 points behind Borussia 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.710
 dortmund prevent 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.580
 I think that today there is to do i 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.580
 congratulations to the bayern 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.240
 we congratulate them 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.220
 think about what you eventually do 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.020
 we can do it in seven days and search 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.700
 to prepare ourselves by knowing that there is a 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.230
 very very heavy result from 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.470
 recover but above all beyond the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.000
 result what you need to worry about 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.180
 which however is a team 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 really very strong so congratulations 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.230
 this is an opportunity for them now 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 because it must make us understand and make people understand 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.220
 a bit to everyone because sometimes we talk 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.430
 way too fast even 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.890
 hasty than to build skyscrapers 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.680
 and it takes time is that it is not that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.680
 come with bucket and shovel e 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.420
 builds it takes time and us 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.500
 we are trying to exploit this 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.060
 time in my and small ways 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.709
 good evening minister wanted to know short 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.270
 how many possibilities even in the light of the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.830
 tonight's game and strength 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.660
 highlighted by the bayern and can there 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.250
 be for for the return race is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.050
 how much will the absences be able to weigh for 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.730
 disqualification of lichtsteiner vidal but how 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.620
 I said earlier 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.400
 a heavy result this and two to zero 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.640
 because it is enough that then there is a travel 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.569
 goal you have to make four however beyond the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.360
 result 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.379
 I repeat we will play against a team 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.700
 which then really seemed to me too 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:28.150
 bad poisoned by the final 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.290
 lost last year against chelsea 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.930
 because we see that in any case there is a 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.400
 really strong competitive fury 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.430
 for their part, you don't know that I like it 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.720
 talk about my team but there is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.579
 in football I won or lost 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.599
 I won something but I lost maybe more 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.730
 of what you win there is to stop 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.079
 shakes hands with opponents of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.739
 to congratulate and thinking then know 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.849
 what to do to try to recur 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.849
 in a better way 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:20.880
 other questions goes behind the lava 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:24.630
 a debugger which you said this 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.270
 game had to tell you how much is still missing 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.120
 to the juventus before danger of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.420
 the bucket of must obviously be read the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.250
 gap is still quite wide between 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.900
 great of Europe to come and win in 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860
 is Europe against very large teams 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.260
 a great team 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.150
 maya but let's say there was no one 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.280
 appetizer that made us understand some 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.070
 situations but I also say that there is 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.700
 however a return to be played on 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.600
 soccer has always taught us the games 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.770
 you have to play them until the last and then 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.690
 to sum up 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.849
 I say this kind of situation 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.959
 these evaluations we should do 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.089
 at the end of the return match 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:10.029
 how much could have engraved take a goal 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:11.409
 after 25 27 seconds and in any case beyond 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.360
 of a match that the Baiano deserved 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.050
 to win the two with this result 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.389
 goals are born 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.709
 in short, in a somewhat special way 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.499
 maybe buffon should have done more 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:22.959
 on both there is sorrow he has 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.119
 so heavily visited is also born for 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.719
 individual errors therefore not 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:30.279
 they have to do with the pressure of the bayern 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:34.419
 definitely to make goals after 25 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:36.999
 seconds has raised even more 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.509
 difficulties not because they have taken 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.300
 courage they took enthusiasm and us 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:47.289
 after 25 seconds 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.629
 however there is a little bit cut off 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.879
 legs not a bit however already put one 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.509
 certainly and psychological condition of 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.509
 inferiority 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:01.990
 I think that in the first half anyway 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:04.149
 when we tried to play and do 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.339
 possession aimed at trying to do it 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.529
 of evil 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:12.969
 something we have succeeded this 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:15.490
 kind of team that I think has it then 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.159
 beat by making a repeat possession 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.050
 aimed at an entry one 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.749
 penetration by the midfielder 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.099
 of the attacker's outsiders today are 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.709
 they were very good because they have 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:29.469
 covered well the spaces they brought 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:31.509
 very high intensity and also physically 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:35.009
 I repeat this is a team that every 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.009
 player or 85 up 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.690
 and the team leads 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 ok
