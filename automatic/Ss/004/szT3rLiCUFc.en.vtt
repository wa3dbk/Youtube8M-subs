aversion to overly sparkly products

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.130 
aversion to overly sparkly products
which<00:00:55.820> don't<00:00:55.970> work<00:00:56.059> as<00:00:56.329> well<00:00:56.360> in<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.899> daytime

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
which don't work as well in the daytime

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.500 
which don't work as well in the daytime
if<00:00:57.739> you're<00:00:58.190> using<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.700> during<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.090> daytime

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
if you're using this during the daytime

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.079 
now as far as an all-over setting powder
it's<00:01:03.380> not<00:01:03.620> quite<00:01:04.040> designed<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> because

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
it's not quite designed for that because

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.330 
it's not quite designed for that because
there<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.600> little<00:01:06.049> bit<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.290> color<00:01:06.710> in<00:01:06.860> each

there is a little bit of color in each
shade<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.659> it<00:01:08.810> works<00:01:09.170> great<00:01:09.799> as<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.040> facial

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430
