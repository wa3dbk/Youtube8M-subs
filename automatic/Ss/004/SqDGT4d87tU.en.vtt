this<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:21.160> always<00:03:22.160> leave<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.490> too<00:03:22.730> long<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.030> just

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
this I always leave this too long I just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.430 
this I always leave this too long I just
give<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.450> general<00:03:23.630> idea<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.320> they

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
give you the general idea that they

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.110 
give you the general idea that they
should<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.950> can<00:03:25.100> get<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.310> board<00:03:25.550> rather<00:03:25.730> be

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
should you can get this board rather be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:35.840 
should you can get this board rather be
much<00:03:26.270> quicker

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.670 

yeah<00:03:36.850> we<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.180> get<00:03:37.240> this<00:03:37.330> one<00:03:37.480> trucker<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
yeah we can get this one trucker and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.410 
yeah we can get this one trucker and
then<00:03:39.100> this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.490> just<00:03:39.520> a<00:03:39.730> different<00:03:40.000> angle<00:03:40.360> that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
then this is just a different angle that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.290 
then this is just a different angle that
you<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.720> get<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.110> from<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.560> mean<00:03:42.150> it's<00:03:43.150> not

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
you can get it from I mean it's not

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.420 
you can get it from I mean it's not
better<00:03:43.540> its<00:03:43.780> worst<00:03:44.380> if<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.740> ask<00:03:44.890> me<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.220> you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
better its worst if you ask me but you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.350 
better its worst if you ask me but you
can<00:03:45.550> might<00:03:45.640> be<00:03:45.700> able<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.880> figure<00:03:46.150> out<00:03:46.270> the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
can might be able to figure out the
