00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
possible to even do that because you

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.050 
possible to even do that because you
can't<00:05:58.099> you<00:05:58.219> have<00:05:58.339> to<00:05:58.400> be<00:05:58.490> going<00:05:58.699> fast<00:05:58.909> enough

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
can't you have to be going fast enough

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
to not fall off and you have to be going

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.159 
to not fall off and you have to be going
slow<00:06:02.569> enough<00:06:02.599> you<00:06:03.050> can<00:06:03.169> actually<00:06:03.289> like<00:06:03.589> steer

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169
