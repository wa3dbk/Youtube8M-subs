proper state boys taught one thing
that's<00:02:41.030> unique<00:02:41.120> about<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.720> wire<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.440> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
that's unique about the wire is the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.330 
that's unique about the wire is the
action<00:02:42.980> arrow<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.430> its<00:02:43.730> own<00:02:43.850> ECU<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:46.100> does

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
action arrow to its own ECU and it does

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.700 
action arrow to its own ECU and it does
some<00:02:46.580> crazy<00:02:46.910> stuff<00:02:47.570> as<00:02:47.930> active<00:02:48.320> at<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.500> rear

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
some crazy stuff as active at the rear

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.130

and<00:02:48.950> at<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.220> front<00:02:49.450> they<00:02:50.450> tell<00:02:50.690> me<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.900> works

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
and at the front they tell me it works

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080 
and at the front they tell me it works
all<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.590> know<00:02:51.710> is<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.130> graph<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.490> stable

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
all I know is that the graph is stable

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.540 
all I know is that the graph is stable
really<00:02:53.960> stable<00:02:54.500> how<00:02:54.710> much<00:02:54.860> about<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.370> arrow

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
really stable how much about the arrow

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.820 
really stable how much about the arrow
not<00:02:55.970> sure<00:02:56.180> but<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.630> really<00:02:56.960> cool<00:02:57.170> feature

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.160 

well<00:03:00.830> for<00:03:01.580> me<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.850> steering<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.630> slow

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
well for me the steering is a bit slow

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.170 
well for me the steering is a bit slow
and<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.590> bit<00:03:03.770> heavy<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.520> lightweight

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and a bit heavy this is a lightweight

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.300 
and a bit heavy this is a lightweight
supercar<00:03:06.020> yet<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.410> steering<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:06.890> quite<00:03:06.920> heavy

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
supercar yet the steering is quite heavy

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.130 
supercar yet the steering is quite heavy
in<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.670> never<00:03:08.300> gives<00:03:08.540> you<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.780> sense<00:03:09.020> of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
in it never gives you the sense of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.980 
in it never gives you the sense of
agility<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.980> expect<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:11.690> quite<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> lot

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
agility that you expect it's quite a lot

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.540 
agility that you expect it's quite a lot
of<00:03:12.020> understeer<00:03:12.140> built<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.220> think<00:03:13.280> that's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
of understeer built in I think that's

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.400 
of understeer built in I think that's
fine<00:03:13.910> with<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.300> car<00:03:14.570> out<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.900> say<00:03:15.050> with<00:03:15.260> this

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
fine with this car out to say with this

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.680 
fine with this car out to say with this
this<00:03:15.680> power<00:03:16.100> delivery<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.850> sheer<00:03:17.120> amount<00:03:17.270> our

this power delivery the sheer amount our

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.199 
this power delivery the sheer amount our
rear<00:03:18.080> wheel<00:03:18.260> drive<00:03:18.500> only<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:19.310> bit<00:03:20.150> of

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
rear wheel drive only a bit of

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.320 
rear wheel drive only a bit of
understeer<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.690> no<00:03:20.900> bad<00:03:21.110> thing<00:03:22.090> loads<00:03:23.090> of

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
understeer is no bad thing loads of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.940 
understeer is no bad thing loads of
traction<00:03:23.540> loads<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.470> loads<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.770> traction

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
traction loads and loads of traction

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.340 
traction loads and loads of traction
even<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.430> second<00:03:25.850> gear<00:03:26.060> but<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.810> mean<00:03:27.020> when<00:03:27.230> you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
even in second gear but I mean when you

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.230 
even in second gear but I mean when you
overcome<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.950> traction<00:03:28.459> you're<00:03:28.610> right<00:03:29.000> in

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
overcome the traction you're right in

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.110 
overcome the traction you're right in
that<00:03:29.360> angry<00:03:29.720> part

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
that angry part

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.589 
that angry part
I<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.720> be

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
I have to be

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.869 
I have to be
so<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.349> top<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.859> otherwise<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.519> gets<00:03:34.640> up

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
so on top of it otherwise it gets up

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:43.390 
so on top of it otherwise it gets up
really<00:03:35.749> really<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.769> been<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.950> real

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
really really so it's been a real

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.459 
really really so it's been a real
privilege<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.269> drive<00:03:44.659> this<00:03:44.870> thing<00:03:45.109> is<00:03:45.290> that

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
privilege to drive this thing is that

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.800 
privilege to drive this thing is that
nothing<00:03:45.859> car<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:46.939> got<00:03:46.999> a<00:03:47.060> character<00:03:47.569> all<00:03:47.659> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
nothing car it's got a character all of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.300 
nothing car it's got a character all of
you<00:03:47.900> Sony<00:03:48.139> doesn't<00:03:48.409> feel<00:03:48.650> as<00:03:48.769> light<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.250> as

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
you Sony doesn't feel as light and as

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.209 
you Sony doesn't feel as light and as
agile<00:03:49.730> as<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.969> softer<00:03:50.739> but<00:03:51.739> it's<00:03:51.859> very<00:03:52.010> will

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
agile as a softer but it's very will

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.069 
agile as a softer but it's very will
find<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.609> low<00:03:52.790> speed<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.239> then<00:03:53.420> when<00:03:53.689> you<00:03:53.870> go

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
find the low speed and then when you go

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.560 
find the low speed and then when you go
for<00:03:54.409> it<00:03:54.469> is<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:55.370> demanding<00:03:55.939> and<00:03:56.450> exciting

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
for it is so demanding and exciting

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.420 
for it is so demanding and exciting
Frankle<00:03:59.900> it's<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.830> million<00:04:01.370> quid<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:04.190> it
