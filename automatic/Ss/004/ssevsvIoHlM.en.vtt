range of colors on top of this we have

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.520 
range of colors on top of this we have
the<00:00:33.399> wedge<00:00:33.610> design<00:00:33.820> which<00:00:34.510> allows<00:00:34.840> us<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.320> use

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
the wedge design which allows us to use

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.710 
the wedge design which allows us to use

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
quality on the W 95 is so good because

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.700 
quality on the W 95 is so good because

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
of the extended dynamic range this

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.410 
of the extended dynamic range this
technology<00:00:42.280> allows<00:00:42.430> us<00:00:42.700> to<00:00:43.030> improve<00:00:43.149> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
technology allows us to improve the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.630 
technology allows us to improve the

this<00:00:45.730> with<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.969> triluminos<00:00:46.359> technology

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
this with the triluminos technology

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.810 
this with the triluminos technology
we're<00:00:47.530> able<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.829> show<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.070> wider<00:00:48.399> range<00:00:48.640> of

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
we're able to show a wider range of

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.939 
we're able to show a wider range of
colors<00:00:49.120> in<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:49.420> lot<00:00:49.600> brighter<00:00:49.809> light<00:00:50.079> sitting

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
colors in a lot brighter light sitting

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.590 
colors in a lot brighter light sitting
felonious<00:00:51.340> would<00:00:51.550> be<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.789> x<00:00:51.969> relative<00:00:52.420> pro

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
felonious would be the x relative pro

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.810 
felonious would be the x relative pro
which<00:00:52.989> really<00:00:53.230> improves<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.649> detail<00:00:54.039> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
which really improves the detail the

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.549 
which really improves the detail the
sound<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.179> the<00:00:55.239> w<00:00:55.510> 95<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.260> impressive

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
sound of the w 95 is so impressive

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.529 
sound of the w 95 is so impressive
because<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.190> wedge<00:00:57.399> shaped<00:00:57.730> design<00:00:57.879> this

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
because of the wedge shaped design this

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.209 
because of the wedge shaped design this
allows<00:00:58.839> us<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.079> introduce<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.589> long<00:00:59.980> duck

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
allows us to introduce the long duck

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.279 
allows us to introduce the long duck
speaker<00:01:00.670> system<00:01:00.999> which<00:01:01.390> gives<00:01:01.600> us<00:01:01.719> much<00:01:02.019> more

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
speaker system which gives us much more

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.740 
speaker system which gives us much more
