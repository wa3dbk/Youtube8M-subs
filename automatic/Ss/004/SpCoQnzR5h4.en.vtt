00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 to make our steak what we 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.230
 we are going to need the rib 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.139
 used to make the rib broth 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.049
 because we cooked ribs before 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.900
 because the time the rib takes to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 cooking is much larger than any 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 one of these ingredients 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 So we cooked over a slow fire. 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.330
 we took and did in the car as the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.699
 despite having tried large 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.500
 part of it because it continues to be tasty 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.770
 then we'll use the rib to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.370
 already pre cooked whole onion 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.730
 smaller whole piece of sweet potato 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.590
 the stock broth that is already 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.540
 the ribs to give a light golden 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 while the sauteed the rib only 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070

 with the other ingredients all there to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.240
 inside 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.240
 straightening 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:02.540
 look what the last piece of the ball and 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:16.260
 ebay had put an end we got it right 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:21.330
 also on our lap to cover everything 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.780
 There were problems with the broth I'm going 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.000
 closing this here will cook and until 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.269
 the ingredients are soft table only 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.180
 the rats are already so early in the hour 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.450
 that the corn the ball the carrot potato is the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.900
 point to the past here 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.450
 The 15 minutes that happened I got 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.700
 everything in here at the right point 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.300
 Corn has attacked the lady're cidinha 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.390
 Great, the potato or the pumpkin is everything. 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.880
 world baked garlic softens opponent 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.040
 So what was the big deal that 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.630
 people had all the flavor of the rib already 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.090
 in the portela where people with 11 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.150
 time and the rib in the back also 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.130
 will be quite soft as well as having 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.440
 I passed lots of flavor to everything and threw it 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.500
 so now we just turn off and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.910
 Come on, get a plate. 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:20.220
 each piece of 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:21.870
 the work carrot to carrot not to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.620
 darken that trick that preaches a 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.620
 little lemon or vinegar in the corn 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.440
 onion 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:47.050
 potato and coconut dishes missing that 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:51.120
 sports is a good piece on the ribs 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.120
 2 is a bit 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:13.890
 find a shortcut and the broth dowels 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:17.040
 everything said 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.739

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.370
 variation with the delicious hot dish 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.440
