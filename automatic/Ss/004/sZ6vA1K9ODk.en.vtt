it<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.310> my<00:02:35.670> jeans<00:02:36.209> which<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.319> have<00:02:37.560> right<00:02:37.860> here

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
it on my jeans which I have right here

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.600 
it on my jeans which I have right here
as<00:02:38.280> well

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
as well

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.369 
as well
somewhere<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:41.069> ultra<00:02:41.370> plugs

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
somewhere there we go the ultra plugs

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.120 
somewhere there we go the ultra plugs
and<00:02:44.959> let's<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.319> else<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.680> here

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and let's see what else we have here

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.690 
and let's see what else we have here
so<00:02:48.030> okay<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.780> on/off<00:02:49.260> switch<00:02:49.680> which<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.250> right

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
so okay the on/off switch which is right

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.920 
so okay the on/off switch which is right
here<00:02:52.549> awesome

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
here awesome

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.569 
here awesome
and<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.140> guessing<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.709> plugs<00:02:56.040> straight

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
and I'm guessing this plugs straight

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.110 
and I'm guessing this plugs straight
into<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> motor<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.280> wire<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.940> go

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
into the motor here is the wire to go

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.030 
into the motor here is the wire to go
into<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> receiver<00:03:01.319> for<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.799> radio<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> let's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
into the receiver for the radio so let's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.440 
into the receiver for the radio so let's
just<00:03:05.160> put<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.579> side<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> second

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
just put this on the side for a second

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.559 
just put this on the side for a second
and<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.530> comes<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.010> fan<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.329> motor

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
and it comes with the fan for the motor

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.759 
and it comes with the fan for the motor
which<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.870> quite<00:03:10.140> nice<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> take<00:03:13.470> out<00:03:13.620> the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
which is quite nice and take out the

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.349 
which is quite nice and take out the
motor<00:03:14.010> now<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.519> let's<00:03:14.700> move<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.239> side

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.129 

pull<00:03:18.359> out<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.530> motor<00:03:19.829> so<00:03:20.819> once<00:03:21.510> again<00:03:21.660> with

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
pull out the motor so once again with

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:27.080 
pull out the motor so once again with
light<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.430> New<00:03:24.389> Castle<00:03:24.900> 1415<00:03:26.090> series

basically<00:04:04.919> I<00:04:05.040> guess<00:04:05.310> hider<00:04:05.579> program<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.680> ESC

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
basically I guess hider program the ESC

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.960 
basically I guess hider program the ESC
which<00:04:09.419> is<00:04:09.540> also<00:04:09.690> nice<00:04:09.959> now<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.700> moment<00:04:11.940> of

run my eighth scale is hot so let's pull

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:48.890 
run my eighth scale is hot so let's pull
this<00:04:42.120> out<00:04:42.740> this<00:04:43.740> is<00:04:43.889> fairly<00:04:44.220> big<00:04:47.120> Wow<00:04:48.180> so

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
this out this is fairly big Wow so

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.840 
this out this is fairly big Wow so
here's<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.680> bullet<00:04:49.950> connectors<00:04:50.070> let's<00:04:50.639> put

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
here's the bullet connectors let's put

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.190 
here's the bullet connectors let's put
it<00:04:50.940> down<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.419> can<00:04:51.600> have<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.780> better<00:04:51.990> look

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
it down so you can have a better look

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.870 
it down so you can have a better look
rather<00:04:52.410> than<00:04:52.680> holding<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.610> what's<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
rather than holding it what's on the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.940 
rather than holding it what's on the
other<00:04:54.030> side<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:55.110> says<00:04:56.780> four<00:04:57.780> pull<00:04:58.320> four<00:04:58.740> more

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
other side it says four pull four more

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.220 
other side it says four pull four more
torque<00:04:59.310> okay<00:05:00.300> sure

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
torque okay sure

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.060 
torque okay sure
so<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.750> motor<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:04.470> reason<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:04.770> went<00:05:04.890> with

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
so this motor the reason I went with

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.970 
so this motor the reason I went with
this<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.340> big<00:05:05.580> because<00:05:05.850> I'm<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.060> basher<00:05:06.480> and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
this is big because I'm a basher and

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.100 
this is big because I'm a basher and
don't<00:05:07.980> I'm<00:05:08.220> not<00:05:08.340> gonna<00:05:08.490> race<00:05:08.700> with<00:05:08.940> this<00:05:09.120> for

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
don't I'm not gonna race with this for

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
light goes down and changed the gearing

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.900 
light goes down and changed the gearing
but<00:05:16.880> initially<00:05:17.880> I'd<00:05:18.120> like<00:05:18.390> to<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:19.050> bash<00:05:19.320> and

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
but initially I'd like to just bash and

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.370 
but initially I'd like to just bash and
this<00:05:20.910> motor<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.360> made<00:05:21.600> for<00:05:21.780> bachelors<00:05:22.200> it's

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
this motor is made for bachelors it's

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.380 
this motor is made for bachelors it's
got<00:05:22.530> a<00:05:22.560> from<00:05:23.460> what<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.610> hear<00:05:23.760> it's<00:05:23.940> got<00:05:24.000> tons<00:05:24.240> of

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
got a from what I hear it's got tons of

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.250 
got a from what I hear it's got tons of
torque<00:05:26.120> yeah<00:05:27.120> it's<00:05:27.300> in<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.600> nutshell<00:05:27.780> that<00:05:28.080> said

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
torque yeah it's in a nutshell that said

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.159 
torque yeah it's in a nutshell that said
I<00:05:28.290> don't<00:05:28.410> want<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.680> do<00:05:29.070> too<00:05:29.250> long<00:05:29.570> put<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.690> ESC

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
I don't want to do too long put the ESC

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.120 
I don't want to do too long put the ESC
next<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.650> as<00:05:31.770> well<00:05:31.979> just<00:05:33.979> put<00:05:34.979> it<00:05:35.070> straight

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
next to it as well just put it straight

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.960 
next to it as well just put it straight
there<00:05:35.580> we<00:05:35.669> go

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
there we go

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.300 
there we go
and<00:05:36.870> these<00:05:37.110> bullet<00:05:37.470> connectors<00:05:37.590> obviously

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
and these bullet connectors obviously

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.730 
and these bullet connectors obviously
get<00:05:38.490> right<00:05:38.669> in<00:05:38.790> a<00:05:38.880> moment<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.630> hand<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.440> film

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
get right in a moment one hand to film

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.240 
get right in a moment one hand to film
the<00:05:40.860> whole<00:05:40.979> this<00:05:41.190> but<00:05:41.490> as<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.419> can<00:05:42.630> see<00:05:43.250> they

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
will plug straight on to these so there

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.100 
will plug straight on to these so there
is<00:05:49.050> no<00:05:49.229> issue<00:05:49.470> there<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:51.090> will<00:05:51.690> be<00:05:51.780> installing

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
is no issue there I will be installing

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.200 
is no issue there I will be installing
this<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.350> I<00:05:53.280> just<00:05:53.460> need<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.700> solder<00:05:53.940> on<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
this in I just need to solder on the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.840 
this in I just need to solder on the
teens<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.169> I'm<00:05:56.039> gonna<00:05:56.190> put<00:05:56.370> this<00:05:56.490> into<00:05:56.729> the

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
teens and I'm gonna put this into the

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.469 
teens and I'm gonna put this into the
short<00:05:57.479> course<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.110> give<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.830> a<00:05:58.890> run<00:05:59.039> I<00:05:59.640> did

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
short course and give it a run I did

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.370 
short course and give it a run I did
think<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:01.250> this<00:06:02.250> was<00:06:02.640> a<00:06:03.000> mod<00:06:03.419> one<00:06:03.870> five

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
think that this was a mod one five

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.900 
think that this was a mod one five
millimeter<00:06:04.830> but<00:06:05.070> now<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.400> I'm<00:06:05.490> holding<00:06:05.640> it

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
millimeter but now that I'm holding it

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.880 
millimeter but now that I'm holding it
there<00:06:06.060> is<00:06:06.120> no<00:06:06.300> way<00:06:06.570> in<00:06:06.720> hell<00:06:06.870> I<00:06:07.140> don't<00:06:07.590> think

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
there is no way in hell I don't think

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.490 
there is no way in hell I don't think
it's<00:06:08.010> even<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.310> point<00:06:08.520> eight<00:06:09.169> if<00:06:10.169> anybody

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
it's even a point eight if anybody

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.409 
it's even a point eight if anybody
watching<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.800> knows<00:06:11.100> what<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.550> pinion<00:06:11.880> what

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
watching this knows what the pinion what

underneath for the fan so we got zip
ties<00:06:33.060> and<00:06:33.360> we've<00:06:33.450> got<00:06:33.570> the<00:06:33.840> extra<00:06:34.350> bullets<00:06:34.710> for

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
ties and we've got the extra bullets for

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.560 
ties and we've got the extra bullets for
the<00:06:37.320> wires<00:06:37.500> here<00:06:37.770> all<00:06:38.580> at<00:06:38.789> all<00:06:38.880> that's<00:06:39.120> it<00:06:39.360> and

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
the wires here all at all that's it and

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.210 
the wires here all at all that's it and
that's<00:06:40.200> where<00:06:40.470> it's<00:06:40.590> going<00:06:40.830> in

that's where it's going in
I'm<00:06:41.640> just<00:06:41.790> gonna<00:06:41.880> paint<00:06:42.180> this<00:06:42.360> stick<00:06:42.690> the

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
I'm just gonna paint this stick the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.460 
I'm just gonna paint this stick the
steering<00:06:43.230> servo<00:06:43.410> and<00:06:43.830> I'm<00:06:44.100> putting<00:06:44.430> a<00:06:44.690> 7<00:06:45.690> 9<00:06:45.840> 4<00:06:46.230> 5

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
steering servo and I'm putting a 7 9 4 5

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.010 
steering servo and I'm putting a 7 9 4 5
th<00:06:46.860> because<00:06:47.100> I<00:06:47.310> have<00:06:47.490> one<00:06:47.700> that's<00:06:48.480> brand<00:06:48.930> new

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
th because I have one that's brand new

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.290 
th because I have one that's brand new
and<00:06:49.320> that's<00:06:49.410> going<00:06:50.340> to<00:06:50.400> be<00:06:50.460> tons<00:06:50.670> of<00:06:50.850> torque<00:06:51.150> so

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
and that's going to be tons of torque so

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.700 
and that's going to be tons of torque so
that<00:06:51.450> six<00:06:52.820> six<00:06:53.820> volts<00:06:54.240> I<00:06:54.480> think<00:06:55.080> it's<00:06:55.350> about

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
that six six volts I think it's about

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.690 
that six six volts I think it's about
two<00:06:56.580> hundred<00:06:56.760> and<00:06:56.970> fifty<00:06:58.190> ounce<00:06:59.190> inches<00:06:59.580> at

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
two hundred and fifty ounce inches at

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.480 
two hundred and fifty ounce inches at
