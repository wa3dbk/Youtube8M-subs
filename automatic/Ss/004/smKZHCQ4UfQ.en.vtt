00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.520
 soon it will be the next console 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.290
 generation begins and with it the 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.780
 first generation where the two 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.519
 key devices almost simultaneously 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.950
 the xbox live in the shop 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.980
 will be released on november 22 the playstation 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.050
 4 on 29 november and so slowly is the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.939
 was scarce for pre-order the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.169
 first are already sold out and one 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.179
 should really think slowly 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.349
 which console do you now under 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.819
 wants to put his television 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.909
 but how do you decide that at all 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.710
 what convinces us about a console 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.269
 buy and leave the other in the shop 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.070
 the one I win is based on 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.960
 certainly loyalty because neither sony 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.699
 still microsoft are in some way 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.210
 good people they only want one of you 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:47.780
 coal coal became kohl is kommune 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 cool colo colo colo colo colo colo colo 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.699
 colo colo colo 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.519
 For example, transa land sony has 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.589
 decided against drm from the beginning and 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.210
 Many people find that very well 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.949
 but they did not do that to you 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.809
 to do something good or because they are 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.420
 net are but because of their analysts 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.280
 have predicted that they will do more 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.780
 sell consoles and make more money 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.920
 Instead of blindly behind a company 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.050
 you should rather run 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.630
 think about what's really important though 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.180
 what is that really what is really 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.920
 It is important that the technology continues 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.140
 the playstation 4 the nose in front through 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.360
 the faster frame is the look 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.500
 about that after the xbox announcement so 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.600
 was spoken a lot 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.190
 or is it the controller at 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.900
 this console generation even at 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.300
 two is pretty much the same, or is it 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.240
 maybe the price the playstation 4 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.880
 costs 400 euros the xbox walker times 100 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.920
 more euro so 500 euros for it 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.280
 However, one of the xbox of synonymous 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 fifa 14 and kinect are there again 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.110
 the question is what you need or want 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 you do not have my opinion 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.450
 to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.040
 However, these are all details of the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 group buys you so a console 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.530
 even they are not buying for 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.729
 look at 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.860
 you do not buy them for 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.810
 Any movement technique one buys 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 they are not for the technology it must 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.500
 There is only one thing that really matters 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:29.430
 is and for the games 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 [Music] 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:39.310
 [Applause] 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:41.890
 [Music] 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.780
 [Applause] 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.450
 I'm not talking about games now 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.620
 like hot dogs or destiny because that gives 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.660
 it for both consoles 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.090
 I would just play it for 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.100
 One of the two consoles gives up games 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 which you have to do without when you are 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 for the other console decides 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.610
 Let's take a look at the launch titles 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440
 So the titles at the same time 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.110
 The console landed loading come for the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.480
 xbox live we once rice that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.030
 this motto was similar schnitzel 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.090
 play by crytek we have precautions 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.830
 motor sportfive the newest part of the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.989
 probably currently best racing game series 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.890
 ever and we have the game of chance 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.550
 killer instinct and the rail shooter 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.620
 carry crises 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.600
 also, of course, dead rising appears 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.489
 3 which I already play extensively 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.470
 but unfortunately could not in Germany 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.230
 for the playstation 4 we have the ego 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.459
 shooter killzone job in front of the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.019
 his artwork at the first 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.880
 presentation pretty for excitement 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.019
 We have still got that 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.500
 jump'n'run crack and the action game 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.510
 Reso can and it was actually 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.459
 already drive works what originally 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.930
 was announced as a launchtitel and so on 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.459
 should speak a bit 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.459
 was postponed to 2014 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.380
 Frankly I have the line up of 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.900
 the two consoles not really 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.130
 from the stool I'm a very good one 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.590
 above all , very likely 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.420
 therefore, in my opinion 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.620
 the xbox just live a bit the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.599
 nose in front but if none of these games 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.459
 would somehow be a ass reflex with me 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.100
 cause if I do not have it 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.329
 could be like glass from where 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.250
 I would be upset animal 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.830
 so let's go in a bit 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.880
 the future looks 2014 because there is 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.860
 even one or the other title 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.150
 announced for the xbox want 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.699
 for example, quantum break from the max 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.919
 payne invent with remedy and the 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.240
 next halo part of the probable 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.150
 Do not miss fans in any case 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.620
 besides, acts come full only for 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.380
 the xbox ears and the pc 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 So who has no gaming pc and is looking for 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.400
 A console must decide in the 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.950
 next generation and necessarily times 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.680
 wants to play full of must to xbox 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.810
 Living grab is full for us 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.690
 from the piz with him for most of that 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.210
 been the gamescom 2013 game 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.860
 because it has led like one 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.820
 faster call of duty we had like that 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.160
 have fun with it 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.930
 that came already in mind for me has 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.520
 the first time modern warfare 2 played 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.600
 what we still have after years 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.630
 I think this will be a complete gamble 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.100
 big title and unfortunately xbox from 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.320
 explodes unfortunately because it is natural 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.630
 it would be better if everyone had to play 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.370
 for the playstation 4 will be released in 2014 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.410
 on the one hand drive we are already short 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.389
 have briefly spoken then still in 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.620
 filmes seconds on which I think so 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.970
 many people are happy 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.340
 and like 1886 one did not become one yet 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.099
 all too much knows except that the gods 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.750
 to work in front of it and that is 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.280
 yes ever quite good is character 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.870
 You also have to keep in mind 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.849
 not all keep that yet 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.139
 interesting title for each 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.150
 consoles are announced 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.010
 there are still developers like naughty dog 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.870
 so far for the playstation many 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.060
 have not announced anything or epic 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.110
 which usually make something for the xbox 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.270
 namely geso before 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.860
 and there will certainly something 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.020
 what we do not know yet 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.020
 but it can also be quite off 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.870
 what is the conclusion now which 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.200
 console should you buy now for now 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.000
 xbox or playstation 4 and mine 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.530
 answer to that is you have to 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.240
 know yourself just look at the 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.680
 titles to the respective consoles 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.389
 come and think about you 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.550
 more appeal is there any title 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.070
 where he says to the I can on 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.720
 do not give up any case because then 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.139
 the decision should be relatively easy 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.389
 fall 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.070
 I for my part would think so 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.650
 favorite developer studio naughty dog 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.270
 to hell and for all 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:50.759
 I have another title for my pc 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:50.759
 [Music] 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.200
 this is from the theme of playstation 4 and xbox 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.150
 from which console you will be 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.070
 decide and unite why it 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.330
 is a particular game or it is 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.040
 but something like the controller or 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.690
 he could pay the price in the 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.500
 I would already write comments 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.240
 interest 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.310
 otherwise we have on the left side 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.600
 another video where we are the coolest bosses 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.280
 and so the big live stream 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.680
 have cut together and on the 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.870
 right side of the sepa around 90 times with 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.820
 could try real weapons 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.530
 not as cool as you might think 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.850
 Thank you very much for that 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.850
 watch until next time
