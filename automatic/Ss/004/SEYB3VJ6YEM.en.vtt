 It is this child who can make a payment on a tablet like this 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.950
 Here is a related video that you can see that related videos are the explanation section below 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.060
 Please see that 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.529

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 Am here it is the same as this also but I was there 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.810
 Say I buyers feeling in such do that I bought it is a service want his will explain after the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.559
 I think but I think I want to open this a little 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:42.829
 square looks even this rough paper bag I'd entered the box 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.820
 You will receive this e-mail facilities It is a short e-mail box I have entered Yamato 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.280
 Setting to open for the first time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.470
 Oh, it's like that already has a very small child included 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.380
 Well 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.080
 If this Koi 2- Cadrie is the instruction manual of this purchase then how many do you buy 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.900
 The manual on which is written 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.400
 Then this 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:10.610
 It's vertical, it's pop, only these three were included 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:16.260
 It seems to be more than the content section I hope to open this one soon 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.770
 I used this tape for this child, so take it here 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:24.079
 It was taken like this 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.100
 It is a great thickness that I think you will understand if you look at this a little compared to a square 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.420
 There is 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.890
 It is even thinner than this in the fact that only Square came out recently also of a flat-screen 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.790
 It feels like the size is cool like this Square feels comfortable 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 It is shaped like a hide round and square Why this kind of wind I'm not subject to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.440
 Count and a little bit but I'm a little no one of human unity clouds circle is run Doi 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.760
 I feel like it's big 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.690
 How do you use it? I think it would be nice if you didn't watch the video you created in Square 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.420
 Though 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:59.170
 It is hardly time to have a card reader of this square 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.479
 Though I'm a story Tteyuu I purchased it is in this love 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:09.849
 In fact, is it able to save Atteyuu the guess is the time to settle anymore but I'm using in my work 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.140
 5 It is when you settle the things of 10,000 yen or more it wind a notice Tteyuu is useless to come by e-mail 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.440
 It has become like 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.410
 For example Kedomo I do not know be some people you Zonchi this 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.410
 Buy expensive things 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:27.710
 So, for example, the Tteyuu buy the number of times light in network Este Toka ticket is basically a deceleration 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:32.180
 It will come off after waking up on the day of the square. The first time is warning. 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:35.430
 This time can not be used even after the next time but you raised you pu up 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 And notice is I'm coming a little lost and I surprised 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 I think a little troubled with the Do not because there is also be asked to fine me for a even to the two or more 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.219
 Whether true because I'm was investigated towards the purchase of here heard that say it is not 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.709
 I do not know for a moment 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:55.420
 In fact I think that I want to use this each other It is in love with this square 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:01.270
 How much the fee is 3 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.900
 I am 25% to come, but 3.44% does not change so much Mariko 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.150
 But 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.800
 Some time that the purchase ligature speed is said to be faster or more of Nesukea moving of here 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.590
 It feels like it takes 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.560
 Both the sense that I felt even use from the top of the slightly dark the cause is I feel it 's a wonder if change 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.630
 It feels like it doesn't change much 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.500
 It is this time Square It is trouble to use that work a little now, so I actually use it in love 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.790
 See 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.629
 Also I would like to report this time me easy in the smartphone and tablet 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 A video Tteyuu card service called Connie, which will be able to rodent-year-old has been doing and 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.450
 Introduced 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.780
 In addition I will try to use this and I would like to review it
