00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
okay just another go at doing the

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.630 
okay just another go at doing the
time-lapse<00:00:16.139> again<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.740> trying<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.189> gain<00:00:17.310> HD

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
time-lapse again and trying to gain HD

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.040 
time-lapse again and trying to gain HD
art<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:18.000> cloudy<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.600> we've<00:00:18.750> trying<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
art it's cloudy now so we've trying to a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.500 
art it's cloudy now so we've trying to a
shot<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> wide-angle<00:00:20.160> using<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> 600d

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
shot with a wide-angle using the 600d

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.230 
shot with a wide-angle using the 600d
pointing<00:00:22.289> upwards<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.820> obviously<00:00:24.150> much

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
pointing upwards so it's obviously much

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.279 
pointing upwards so it's obviously much
brighter<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:24.630> sky<00:00:24.840> even<00:00:24.990> though<00:00:25.140> it's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
brighter in the sky even though it's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
brighter in the sky even though it's
cloudy<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.910> much<00:00:27.090> darker<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.840> that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
cloudy and it's much darker here so that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
cloudy and it's much darker here so that
HDR<00:00:28.230> hopefully<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:28.830> work<00:00:28.949> okay<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.210> said

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
HDR hopefully will work okay or I said

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
HDR hopefully will work okay or I said
have<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> look<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> setting<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.009> I've<00:00:32.099> got

it's going to be doing just the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
it's going to be doing just the
background<00:00:46.020> basically<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.650> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> distance

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

overexposed shots and the sequence will

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.669 
overexposed shots and the sequence will
go<00:01:57.789> in<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.060> can<00:01:58.179> see<00:01:58.330> it'll<00:01:58.630> be<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.380> normal

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
go in you can see it'll be the normal

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.499 
go in you can see it'll be the normal
shot<00:01:59.890> that's<00:02:00.069> at<00:02:00.130> 125th<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.789> second<00:02:01.119> and

shot that's at 125th of a second and
it'll<00:02:01.780> do<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.899> underexposed<00:02:02.560> shot<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.979> then

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
it'll do the underexposed shot and then

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.160 
it'll do the underexposed shot and then
you'll<00:02:03.159> do<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.340> overexposed<00:02:03.700> shot<00:02:04.179> I'm<00:02:05.020> not

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
you'll do the overexposed shot I'm not

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.990 
you'll do the overexposed shot I'm not
going<00:02:05.319> to<00:02:05.409> use<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.649> ISO<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.399> do<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.849> it's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
going to use the ISO to do this it's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900 
going to use the ISO to do this it's
going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.149> be<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.599> aperture<00:02:08.019> so<00:02:08.910> that's

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
going to be just the aperture so that's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.720 
going to be just the aperture so that's
the<00:02:10.060> settings<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.959> HDR<00:02:11.650> bracketing<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.309 

if<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.880> go<00:02:16.120> back<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.569> Magic<00:02:16.810> Mountain<00:02:16.840> again

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
if I go back in to Magic Mountain again

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.759 
if I go back in to Magic Mountain again
and<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:19.000> show<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.390> interval<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> meter<00:02:20.620> I'm

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
and just show the interval a meter I'm

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.130 
and just show the interval a meter I'm
going<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.950> set<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.130> for<00:02:21.720> five<00:02:22.720> seconds

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
going to set that for five seconds

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.599 
going to set that for five seconds
basically<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:25.859> let<00:02:26.859> that<00:02:27.010> go<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.310> I'm<00:02:27.579> just

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
basically and let that go so I'm just

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.670 
basically and let that go so I'm just
going<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.810> come<00:02:29.109> out<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.440> now<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
going to like come out of that now and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.900 
going to like come out of that now and
press<00:02:29.890> half<00:02:30.160> press<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.400> shutter<00:02:30.579> button

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
press half press the shutter button

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.110 
press half press the shutter button
there<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:32.340> see<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.400> starts<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> take<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
there you see it starts to take the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.209 
there you see it starts to take the
shots

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.059 

I'll<00:02:44.219> stop<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.459> for<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> second<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.239> and

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
I'll stop that for a second there and

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.110 
I'll stop that for a second there and
show<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.400> shots<00:02:47.609> quickly<00:02:47.909> what<00:02:48.000> it's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
show you the shots quickly what it's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.050 
show you the shots quickly what it's
doing<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.230> doing<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.879> see<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
doing so it's doing there you can see it

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.309 
doing so it's doing there you can see it
starting<00:02:51.299> for<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.450> first<00:02:51.659> one<00:02:51.810> at<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.019> twenty

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
starting for the first one at one twenty

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.099 
starting for the first one at one twenty
twenty-fifth<00:02:53.069> of<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.250> second<00:02:53.959> correctly<00:02:54.959> kind

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
twenty-fifth of a second correctly kind

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:56.959 
twenty-fifth of a second correctly kind
of<00:02:55.170> exposed<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.859> scene<00:02:56.069> then<00:02:56.819> it's

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
of exposed one for the scene then it's

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.069 
of exposed one for the scene then it's
doing<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.239> one<00:02:57.329> underexposed<00:02:57.900> it's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
doing the one underexposed it's

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.360 
doing the one underexposed it's
calculating<00:02:58.530> their<00:02:58.650> one<00:02:58.829> hundredth<00:02:59.189> of<00:02:59.250> a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
calculating their one hundredth of a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.970 
calculating their one hundredth of a
second<00:02:59.819> it's<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> clouds<00:03:01.109> in<00:03:01.290> nicely<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
second it's the clouds in nicely and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.649 
second it's the clouds in nicely and
then<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.519> doing<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> overexposed<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.540> at

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
then it's doing the overexposed one at

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.699 
then it's doing the overexposed one at
1/6<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.200> second

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.860 

so<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.400> see<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.670> sequence<00:03:10.000> there<00:03:10.239> it'll<00:03:10.719> do

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
so you see the sequence there it'll do

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.860 
so you see the sequence there it'll do
the<00:03:11.650> correct<00:03:12.489> expose<00:03:12.760> on<00:03:12.879> 125th<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.569> second

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
the correct expose on 125th of a second

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the correct expose on 125th of a second
then<00:03:13.959> it'll<00:03:14.109> move<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.409> one<00:03:14.530> hundred<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.859> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
then it'll move to one hundred to the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.940 
then it'll move to one hundred to the
second<00:03:15.250> underexposed<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.420> you'll<00:03:16.540> do<00:03:16.689> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
second underexposed then you'll do the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.630 
second underexposed then you'll do the
overexposed<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.099> I'll<00:03:18.159> keep<00:03:18.280> doing<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
overexposed and I'll keep doing that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:42.800 
overexposed and I'll keep doing that
sequence<00:03:19.120> building<00:03:19.719> the<00:03:19.810> scene

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.870
