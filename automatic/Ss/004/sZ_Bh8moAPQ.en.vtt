we're featuring the pm-9 just because

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.600 
we're featuring the pm-9 just because
it's<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> pm-9<00:00:52.350> mean<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> more

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it's the pm-9 mean what is more

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
it's the pm-9 mean what is more
interesting<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.420> PMI<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.050> Moab<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.649> mean

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
interesting to me the PMI in Moab I mean

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.490 
interesting to me the PMI in Moab I mean
I<00:00:56.100> guess<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> USP<00:00:57.059> Moab<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.629> pm-9<00:00:58.109> Moab<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I guess the USP Moab but pm-9 Moab is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
I guess the USP Moab but pm-9 Moab is
probably<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> better<00:01:00.239> ones<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.660> mean

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
probably one of the better ones I mean

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
probably one of the better ones I mean
he<00:01:00.870> does<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> different<00:01:01.770> gun<00:01:01.980> there
