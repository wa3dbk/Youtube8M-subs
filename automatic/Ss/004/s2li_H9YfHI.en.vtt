00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
animation scale I turned it off so that

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
animation scale I turned it off so that
made<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:58.980> look<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.239> applications

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
made it look like that the applications

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
made it look like that the applications
are<00:01:00.870> opening<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> lot<00:01:01.559> faster<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.550> i'm<00:01:02.609> going<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

are opening a lot faster so i'm going to
show<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> example<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:03.960> i<00:01:04.019> open

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
show you example right now so if i open

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
show you example right now so if i open
messaging<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.549> opens<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.939> lot<00:01:06.090> quicker<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.600> open

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
messaging it opens a lot quicker or open

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
messaging it opens a lot quicker or open
phone<00:01:07.640> actually<00:01:08.640> opens<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.570> faster

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
phone actually opens a little bit faster

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830 
phone actually opens a little bit faster
now<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.799> was<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> put<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.340> back<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.760> 10<00:01:11.970> it
