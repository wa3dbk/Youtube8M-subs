00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 The first one asks the name of the tag then 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 my phone 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.450
 the first question is which your cell phone 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.399
 my cell phone an iphone 4s 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.910
 so that's the model and brand an iphone 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.170
 4s how many apps do you have to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.210
 ask if the agent can not say 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.270
 How many apps do I have but I 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.190
 I have a few so it's just the basics 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 college I did not think it was going to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.909
 take too much but few I go 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.119
 show you soon our 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.409
 favorite app and which one do you most 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.420
 access 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 for me the favorites and instagram and the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.729
 whatsapp are the ones that have the most access to them 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.119
 daily appear to me then 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.820
 favorites is already big 4 464 which 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 application makes your life easier I guess 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.030
 that I know I like the most is taste 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 So much to disappoint, we can talk. 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.530
 what do we want to do with you? 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.730
 so I like it very much and one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 which I really like too 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.070
 it's the applications that people 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.990
 can track orders that we made 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.620
 You know then I use a good monator bator. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.720
 tolerance as it says and okada package eu 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.210
 I downloaded that I traveled and I spoke then 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.030
 Why the one that uses it is not anymore 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.130
 Updating here on my cell phone is there 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 people are not notifying do not give in to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 change and he was not staying I think 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.060
 Bad I have to stay there all the time. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.830
 update 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.630
 so I downloaded the fourth package I 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.880
 I want to start using it now 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.690
 question number 5 coast the application 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 The most useless you have to delete 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.320
 We like it when I download it. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.470
 application that I see that I will not use 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.250
 he listens and without the least he knows then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:26.990
 I do not have many here but more useless 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.400
 I do not think there are any people or anything at all 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.860
 I will not use it, I have already chosen, it does not have 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 penalty for excluding any number 6 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.850
 What is your favorite photo app? 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.620
 because I like the most is online and offline 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.620
 camera that's the one here 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.550
 Everyone has but what I use the most is 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.930
 this one and where I use it a lot is also 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.570
 This photo photo London I do not know how it is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.860
 but that's what I like also that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.860
 I like to use only these two 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.170
 and you play on the cell phone while the game 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.140
 favorite rudder plays on the phone 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.300
 Oh my god, I do not play, I have only one 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.280
 game application that but once in 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.180
 When I play bad but it's very difficult. 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.560
 even that application is asked 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.620
 in a team 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.049
 so I do not play much I played him more 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.250
 but then when I started to sing 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.560
 benefiting if I stop using it because 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.239
 otherwise we lose a lot of time I think 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.459
 that I have other things to do 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.530
 other priorities you know if you do not 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.510
 time playing more and more 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.459
 They asked me if I ever got to play a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.410
 A little more but I do not have a game. 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.480
 I have to set an example there 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.790
 question number 8 shows the last song 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.790
 You listen on my cell phone, I do not listen. 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.590
 music on the cell phone is great to say 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.370
 our last photo you took one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.349
 cell phone 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.099
 I already took the eloy photo of the makeup myself 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.099
 I took a photo 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.190
 It was a photo of me, you know. 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.750
 Last picture I took was 10 with the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.690
 application that you think everyone 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.670
 should have I find it very useful and xd 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.620
 people trace how I think who 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.780

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.389

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.440
 example when the picture becomes too large 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.690
