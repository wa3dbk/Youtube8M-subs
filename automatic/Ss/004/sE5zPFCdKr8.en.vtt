00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.660
 Hi, I'm Alfredo Villanueva on the day of 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.850
 today we are going to use a juice 2000 we are going to 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.120
 make a roasted chicken breast with 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.119
 apple-tree mashed potatoes and a little 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.779
 avocado this rotisserie I like very much 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:23.330
 because of its size it is very practical 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.759
 to use two boneless chicken breasts 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.240
 but with the skin two pieces of lemon 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:35.960
 yellow lemon green chile manzano papa 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.719
 avocado garlic two teaspoons seed 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.879
 of coriander three tablespoons of oil 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.660
 coconut and two teaspoons of grain salt 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.120
 in our mortar or a molcajete we go 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.829
 to join two teaspoons of seeds 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.899
 cilantro the garlic 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.120
 come out grains here I'm going to put some 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.770
 oil nothing more to facilitate the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.590
 grind some yellow lemon 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.810
 this lemon stopped half an hour to high 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.370
 temperature to burn it and it's going to 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.479
 give that 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.909
 Charcoal but citrus sensation now 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.240
 yes let's marinate let's put it here 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.369
 here I will put the rest of lemon that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.369
 I wanted like more oil 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.399
 and marinate while mashed 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.680
 chopping potatoes let them to put 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.640
 our flavor together with the apple-tree chili 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.729
 and it will vary between 20 and 30 minutes and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.490
 we will review it has already happened in 30 minutes 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.340
 our potatoes must already be cooked and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.799
 we will check it by chopping the potato with 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.530
 a knife or with a toothpick and if 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.450
 easily assume the potatoes are ready 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.030
 we take the stone from the potatoes 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.490
 peak very well to facilitate mash the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.119
 added apple-tree chili to the bowl 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 we will clean very well from the seeds and 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.380
 of the skin and cut it with the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.780
 very thin knife 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.240
 I add a lemon and a half 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.149
 Salt 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.940
 olive oil begin to crush 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.780
 until we make an emulsion add the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.450
 chile finely cut our 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.180
 breasts and are perfectly marinating 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.180
 it is not a tracer and there is the temperature 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 we need let's put our chicken 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:32.489
 with the skin down and we close 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.090
 I'm going to lower the temperature to the part 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.879
 half past our 10 minutes I'm going 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.569
 to check the chicken I think it's time 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.569
 to turn it over 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.870
 I'm going to close it two more minutes 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.360
 I'm going to take the breast very delicate 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.870

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.000
