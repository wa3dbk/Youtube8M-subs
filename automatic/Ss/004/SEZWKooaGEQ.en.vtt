most people who have G shocks are
checking<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.170> watch<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.920> that's<00:03:11.040> why<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
checking this watch out so that's why I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.119 
checking this watch out so that's why I
did<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.569> but<00:03:12.569> uh<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:13.440> got<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.620> hold<00:03:13.829> it<00:03:13.920> level

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
did that but uh you got to hold it level

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.319 
did that but uh you got to hold it level
to<00:03:14.910> get<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.690> compass<00:03:16.290> let<00:03:17.280> me<00:03:17.400> move<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
to get the compass let me move this up a

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.400 
to get the compass let me move this up a
little<00:03:18.450> bit<00:03:18.600> there's<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.590> compass<00:03:21.410> works

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
little bit there's a compass works

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.129 
little bit there's a compass works
really<00:03:22.769> good<00:03:23.239> make<00:03:24.239> sure<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.569> level<00:03:24.720> because

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
really good make sure it's level because

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.129 
really good make sure it's level because
north<00:03:25.769> east<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.370> start<00:03:26.670> tilting<00:03:26.880> up<00:03:27.209> east

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
north east if you start tilting up east

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.059 
north east if you start tilting up east
and<00:03:28.530> then<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> go

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
and then I go

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.860 
and then I go
you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.370> south<00:03:29.670> east<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.120> make<00:03:30.329> sure<00:03:30.359> it's

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you know south east so make sure it's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.569 
you know south east so make sure it's
level<00:03:31.230> or<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.680> will<00:03:31.829> not<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.099> a<00:03:32.160> proper

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
level or you will not get a proper

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
because I found myself doing that three

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.000 
because I found myself doing that three
times<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.950> week<00:04:24.980> wondering<00:04:25.760> what<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.000> day<00:04:26.150> is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010

times a week wondering what the day is
also<00:04:28.010> March<00:04:28.250> I'll<00:04:28.580> go<00:04:28.730> ahead<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:28.940> put<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.150> on

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
also March I'll go ahead and put it on

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.440 
also March I'll go ahead and put it on
my<00:04:29.360> wrist<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:30.190> take<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.220> second<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.120> a

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
my wrist I take a second and it is a

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.780 
my wrist I take a second and it is a
little<00:04:32.720> bit<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.400> harder<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.490> put<00:04:34.639> on<00:04:34.730> the

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
little bit of a harder to put on the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.690 
little bit of a harder to put on the
wrist<00:04:35.000> in<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.419> g-shot<00:04:35.630> but<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:37.280> take<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> few

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
wrist in the g-shot but just take a few

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.940 
wrist in the g-shot but just take a few
extra<00:04:37.760> seconds<00:04:38.419> actually<00:04:39.260> harder<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.800> take

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
extra seconds actually harder to take

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.820 
extra seconds actually harder to take
off<00:04:40.220> I'd<00:04:40.460> say<00:04:40.639> it's<00:04:40.880> not<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.030> hard<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.330> put<00:04:41.510> on

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
off I'd say it's not that hard to put on

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.060 
off I'd say it's not that hard to put on
but<00:04:43.600> very<00:04:44.600> comfortable<00:04:44.960> once<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.710> get<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.950> on

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
but very comfortable once you get it on

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.030 
but very comfortable once you get it on
this<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.520> very<00:04:46.880> lightweight<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.660> do<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.830> this

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
this is very lightweight I do like this

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.909 
this is very lightweight I do like this
a<00:04:49.100> lot<00:04:49.400> because<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:51.020> keeps<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.470> snapped<00:04:51.740> in

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
a lot because it keeps the snapped in

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.760 
a lot because it keeps the snapped in
place<00:04:52.160> because<00:04:53.060> a<00:04:53.240> lot<00:04:53.419> of<00:04:53.510> watches<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:54.530> know

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
place because a lot of watches you know

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.830 
place because a lot of watches you know
you<00:04:54.830> have<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.070> move<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.340> on<00:04:55.550> down<00:04:55.790> so<00:04:56.720> it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
you have to move this on down so it

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.390 
you have to move this on down so it
ain't<00:04:56.930> much<00:04:57.140> slack<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.740> know<00:04:57.800> just<00:04:58.100> hanging

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
ain't much slack you know just hanging

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.159 
ain't much slack you know just hanging
out<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.030> you<00:04:59.120> got<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.330> whole<00:04:59.360> flat<00:04:59.750> pane<00:04:59.990> and

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
out and you got the whole flat pane and

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.440 
out and you got the whole flat pane and
I<00:05:00.230> really<00:05:00.470> don't<00:05:00.560> like<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.940> does<00:05:02.210> that

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
I really don't like that this does that

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.720 
I really don't like that this does that
once<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:02.870> go<00:05:03.020> through<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:04.340> know<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.550> put

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
once you go through you know you put

there we go you read some more angles of

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.880 
there we go you read some more angles of
it<00:05:37.550> but<00:05:38.539> uh<00:05:38.570> just<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.140> give<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.350> an<00:05:39.470> idea<00:05:39.590> about
