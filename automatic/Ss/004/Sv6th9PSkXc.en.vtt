00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 certainly the world so today I 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.460
 you presented the light esti map 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.760
 golden louis camera so as you can 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
 to see him 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.759
 so it's a lightning with a 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.550
 adapter to be able to read cards 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.359
 sd then you can read sd cards 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.949
 as well as the sdhc cards they have from 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.449
 larger capacities also a lot 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.890
 faster 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 so I will buy at the price of 29 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 euros so my store but you can 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.550
 the find same price on the apple website 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.969
 so this article but now that for 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.610
 the ipad i tested on my iphone 5 is 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.360
 It is one of which the accessory is not 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 not recognized then so I beg you 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 administration I would open iphoto and pouf 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.960
 directly it will load you the photos 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.280
 you can see that it was very fast 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 but that's probably because of the fact that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.620
 it is a purchased sdhc so for example 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.309
 if you want to import an image so 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.289
 you do 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 click on it and hop and by the way 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.060
 import so either import everything or 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.710
 import the selection so then you 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 go back in photo and you can see 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.689
 that photo I imported pumpkin 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.700
 then and ask you like on iphoto 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.939
 if he has to delete or keep 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
 photos on the map sd 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.920
 so do as you want me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 I will keep 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.290
 so you have to know me I did that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:37.110
 with a SLR camera and finally 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 Wholesale So the photos are enough 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.549
 heavy hairdressers some do 15 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:49.079
 mo finally the majority make 15 mo and 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:52.290
 the adapter him when we put the photos 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.119
 on the ipod he reduced the photos have by 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.159
 example if you send a photo by 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.200
 email you will see how it is put 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.719
 that your photo makes a fifth in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.890
 high place of its original size of 15 m 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.890
 and so here
