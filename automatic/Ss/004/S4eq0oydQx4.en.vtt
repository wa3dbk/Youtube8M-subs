got<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.580> octave<00:00:34.100> in<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.220> modern

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.500 

right<00:00:40.370> there<00:00:40.580> you<00:00:40.760> can<00:00:40.910> just<00:00:41.030> repeat<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.300> same

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
right there you can just repeat the same

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.240 
right there you can just repeat the same
shape<00:00:41.780> three<00:00:42.020> times<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:42.470> three<00:00:42.620> octaves<00:00:43.010> and

shape three times it's three octaves and
what<00:00:43.430> I'm<00:00:43.550> doing<00:00:43.880> is<00:00:44.090> pretty<00:00:44.960> much<00:00:45.140> just<00:00:45.350> like

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
what I'm doing is pretty much just like

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.960 
what I'm doing is pretty much just like
a<00:00:46.270> blues<00:00:47.270> thing<00:00:47.450> like<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.660> flat<00:00:47.960> five<00:00:48.200> thing

something<00:00:52.970> like<00:00:53.060> that<00:00:53.270> but<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.110> idea<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.530> it's

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
something like that but the idea is it's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.460 
something like that but the idea is it's
like<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> gypsy<00:00:55.130> thing<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.640> gypsies<00:00:56.000> they<00:00:56.120> do

three extra strings something like that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.160 
three extra strings something like that
but<00:01:02.000> instead<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.330> three<00:01:02.570> huntsmen<00:01:02.960> sort<00:01:03.110> of

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
but instead of three huntsmen sort of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.600 
but instead of three huntsmen sort of
six<00:01:03.380> notes<00:01:03.620> done<00:01:03.860> three<00:01:04.040> notes<00:01:04.160> of<00:01:04.250> string<00:01:04.460> you
