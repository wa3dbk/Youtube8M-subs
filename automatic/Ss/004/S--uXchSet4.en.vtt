00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and then you know the back is kind of we

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
and then you know the back is kind of we
don't<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.869> which<00:01:22.200> side<00:01:22.409> belongs<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.920> which

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
don't know which side belongs to which

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
don't know which side belongs to which
but<00:01:23.340> whatever<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.570> secured<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> with

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
but whatever and then I secured it with

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:35.770 
but whatever and then I secured it with
a<00:01:25.439> clip<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> now<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> am

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
a clip as you can see so now I am

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
a clip as you can see so now I am
twisting<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.049> other<00:01:37.259> side<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.250> same

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
twisting the other side in the same

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
twisting the other side in the same
manner<00:01:38.759> using<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.869> same<00:01:40.049> amount<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> Marley

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
manner using the same amount of Marley

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800 
manner using the same amount of Marley
hair<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> tuck<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.329> rolling<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
hair and tuck in and rolling it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.720 
hair and tuck in and rolling it
backwards

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.820 

once<00:01:51.730> I<00:01:51.820> finished<00:01:52.150> twisting<00:01:52.720> both<00:01:53.080> sides<00:01:53.470> I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
once I finished twisting both sides I

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.860 
once I finished twisting both sides I
remove<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> clip<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:54.790> then<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.120> combine<00:01:55.540> both

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
remove the clip and then I combine both

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.630 
remove the clip and then I combine both
pieces<00:01:56.260> together<00:01:56.650> by<00:01:57.040> twisting<00:01:57.490> them

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
pieces together by twisting them

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.030 
pieces together by twisting them
together<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:59.080> going<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.500> be<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.620> little

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
together it is going to be a little

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.710 
together it is going to be a little
challenging<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:01.030> you're<00:02:01.240> twisting<00:02:01.600> in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
challenging because you're twisting in

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.570 
challenging because you're twisting in
opposite<00:02:02.140> directions<00:02:02.260> but<00:02:02.860> once<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.250> get

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
opposite directions but once you get

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.910 
opposite directions but once you get
everything<00:02:03.940> together<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.630> should<00:02:04.810> be<00:02:04.930> fine<00:02:05.110> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.130
