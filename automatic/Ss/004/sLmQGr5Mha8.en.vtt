another good way to block Michael Myers

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
another good way to block Michael Myers
is<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.120> UM<00:01:03.619> block<00:01:04.619> stairways<00:01:06.080> like<00:01:07.080> when

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is to UM block stairways like when

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.460 
is to UM block stairways like when
you're<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.860> top<00:01:08.100> somewhere<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.170> only<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you're on top somewhere and it's only a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
you're on top somewhere and it's only a
ladder<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.159> up<00:01:11.220> somewhere<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
ladder to get up somewhere and then you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
ladder to get up somewhere and then you
just<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.450> right<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> ladder<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
just get right from the ladder when you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.010 
just get right from the ladder when you
try<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> crawl<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.600> let's<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> beat

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
try to crawl up let's see if you beat

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
try to crawl up let's see if you beat
them<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.520> stand<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
them there and you just stand there and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.179 
them there and you just stand there and
then<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.960> push<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.530> down<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
then you just push them down like this

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
then you just push them down like this
although<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> have<00:01:23.460> mad<00:01:23.729> skills<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.890> don't<00:01:25.890> even

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
although I have mad skills I don't even

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
although I have mad skills I don't even
