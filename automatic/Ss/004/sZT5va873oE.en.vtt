rectangular and rounded but really

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050 
rectangular and rounded but really
really<00:00:27.480> round<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.800> standard<00:00:29.310> round

display<00:00:30.480> component<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.410> why<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
display component this is why the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.229 
display component this is why the
technology<00:00:32.009> was<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.120> was

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
technology was this is what was

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.510 
technology was this is what was
available<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> model

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
available and so when you make the model

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.799 
available and so when you make the model
that<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> get

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that this is what you get

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.530 
that this is what you get
yes<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> round<00:00:38.219> watch<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.239> has<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> very

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
yes it's a round watch but it has a very

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
yes it's a round watch but it has a very
large<00:00:39.870> border<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.980> display<00:00:41.399> feels<00:00:41.760> very

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
large border and the display feels very

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569 
large border and the display feels very
small<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.070> want<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> do

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
small so this is what we want it to do

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
small so this is what we want it to do
right<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:44.940> wanted<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> something<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
right we wanted to get to something that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
right we wanted to get to something that
felt<00:00:46.500> multi<00:00:46.920> still<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.520> fine<00:00:48.020> well

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
felt multi still more fine well

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
felt multi still more fine well
streamline<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.550> niche<00:00:50.820> feels<00:00:51.090> progressive

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
streamline the niche feels progressive

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.270 
streamline the niche feels progressive
because<00:00:51.750> what's<00:00:52.110> important<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> content

but<00:02:13.829> for<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.069> really<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.549> biggest

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
but for now really the biggest

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.220 
but for now really the biggest
difference<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.540> finally<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.019> watch

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
difference is we finally have watch

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
faces that don't suck and that folks is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.319

a short version of the Moto 360 it's not

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.750 
a short version of the Moto 360 it's not
perfect<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.079> for<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.379> it's<00:02:22.920> probably<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
perfect but for now it's probably the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.810 
perfect but for now it's probably the
