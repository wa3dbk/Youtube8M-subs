that will boost up the tickets and it'll
take<00:02:38.850> even<00:02:39.000> longer<00:02:39.480> than<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.260> we'll

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
take even longer than and then we'll

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.820 
take even longer than and then we'll
actually<00:02:40.680> would<00:02:41.010> normally<00:02:42.590> one<00:02:43.590> thing<00:02:43.740> i

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
you can create yourself first off that's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.300

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
times it gets frustrating it'll start

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.350

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
anymore so when I search for a match I

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.770
