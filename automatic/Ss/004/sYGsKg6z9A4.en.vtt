00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.980
 That's where I'm going to teach you a line. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:11.870
 green with your pink and to make alone and 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.870
 super beautiful you will need 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 green enamel white white enamel pink 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:33.600
 a staple brush for decoration and ribbon 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 and I will start applying the tape 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:57.719
 the tip of the nail and I will paint the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 rest of mint green and even before 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:07.070
 green and I'm going to remove ribbon on the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.070
 remaining part I'll go blank 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 in the division of green and white and I will 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.280
 make a pink line 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 and now with a clamp I'm going to make a 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 ball in the middle of this red line not to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 back to do it so I'm going to do two 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.990
 vertical lines one year on the right and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.990
 left 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.030
 I'll connect these lines in the ball and I'll 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:03.900
 paint everything in the middle as if it were a 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:07.760
 triangle and to give a detail in the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.760
 I'm going to make a white ball in the middle 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.490
 Good folks, that's how the nail got 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.709
 I really hope you have 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.720
 I like it if you like it, stop giving 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.120
 a jewel in the video for me and do not follow 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.750
 in social networks a kiss and even 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.020
 next 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.020
 tea
