00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.020 
master McHugh's and solid monk master
Baku<00:04:08.959> was<00:04:09.110> well<00:04:09.320> out<00:04:09.470> here

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.000 

so<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.180> locally<00:04:14.600> odd<00:04:14.780> master<00:04:15.290> McHugh<00:04:15.620> when<00:04:15.890> in

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
so the locally odd master McHugh when in

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.849 
so the locally odd master McHugh when in
control<00:04:16.750> all<00:04:17.750> those<00:04:17.930> solid<00:04:18.230> monk<00:04:18.410> is<00:04:18.590> coming

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
control all those solid monk is coming

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.060 
control all those solid monk is coming
back<00:04:19.010> at<00:04:19.190> him<00:04:19.220> oh<00:04:19.850> it's<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.390> really<00:04:20.570> tight<00:04:20.900> one

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.670 

so<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.100> think<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.490> red<00:04:25.640> color<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.410> red

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
so I think the red color is the red

00:04:27.680 --> 00:07:11.129 
so I think the red color is the red
color

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.139
