00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
powder which I'll do once I cut off this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.729 
powder which I'll do once I cut off this
lace<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:09.170> does<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.959> French<00:03:11.959> lace<00:03:12.319> so

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
lace it does have the French lace so

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.129 
lace it does have the French lace so
it's<00:03:13.069> a<00:03:13.370> little<00:03:13.849> bit<00:03:14.060> stiff<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.750> only<00:03:14.930> thing<00:03:15.079> I

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
hate about the stiff laces is that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.449 
hate about the stiff laces is that
sometimes<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.660> can<00:03:17.690> eat<00:03:18.079> your<00:03:18.650> head<00:03:18.889> but<00:03:19.370> you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
sometimes it can eat your head but you

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.909 
sometimes it can eat your head but you
can<00:03:19.639> put<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> little<00:03:20.299> bit<00:03:20.480> of<00:03:20.750> petroleum<00:03:21.380> jelly
