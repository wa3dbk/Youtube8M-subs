how<00:01:20.130> did<00:01:20.189> exactly<00:01:21.180> tell<00:01:21.360> us<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.659> bit

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
how did exactly tell us a little bit

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
how did exactly tell us a little bit
more<00:01:21.990> about<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.650> exciting<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
more about that's really exciting and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.240 
more about that's really exciting and
interesting<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:25.080> we've<00:01:25.920> studied

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
interesting because I we've studied

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.460 
interesting because I we've studied
human<00:01:26.670> psychology<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.450> people<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.320> do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
human psychology that people will do

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.620 
human psychology that people will do
things<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> period<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.090> least<00:01:30.240> seven

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
things for a period of at least seven

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
things for a period of at least seven
minutes<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.560> will<00:01:31.740> sustain<00:01:31.979> for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
minutes think they will sustain for

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.760 
minutes think they will sustain for
seven<00:01:32.850> minutes<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.619> for

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
seven minutes so if you do that for

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
seven minutes so if you do that for
twenty-one<00:01:35.310> days<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.880> develop<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.600> new

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
twenty-one days it would develop a new

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
twenty-one days it would develop a new
habit<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> wrote<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.030> book<00:01:39.060> my
