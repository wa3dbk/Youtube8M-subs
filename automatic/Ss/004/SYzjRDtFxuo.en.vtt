follow nature's rules people are

of stresses in the world today for some
decades<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.170> we've<00:02:22.380> been<00:02:22.500> talking<00:02:22.680> about

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
decades now we've been talking about

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.820 
decades now we've been talking about
saving<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.490> planet<00:02:23.840> but<00:02:24.840> I've<00:02:25.530> come<00:02:25.800> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
saving the planet but I've come to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.370 
saving the planet but I've come to
realize<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.460> not<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.210> issue<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
realize that's not really the issue the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.310 
realize that's not really the issue the
issue<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.920> civilization<00:02:29.900> itself<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> whether

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
issue is civilization itself and whether

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:52.570 
issue is civilization itself and whether
we<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.770> save<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580
