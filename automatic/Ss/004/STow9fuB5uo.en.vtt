last<00:00:18.710> time<00:00:18.860> on<00:00:19.039> garden<00:00:19.340> steps<00:00:19.580> we<00:00:19.760> talked

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
last time on garden steps we talked

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.850 
last time on garden steps we talked
about<00:00:20.060> organic<00:00:20.689> mulches<00:00:21.080> now<00:00:21.590> there<00:00:21.770> are

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
about organic mulches now there are

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.160 
about organic mulches now there are
other<00:00:22.039> kinds<00:00:22.460> of<00:00:22.520> bulges<00:00:22.910> too<00:00:23.119> most<00:00:23.660> commonly

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
other kinds of bulges too most commonly

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.230 
other kinds of bulges too most commonly
rock<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:24.740> while<00:00:25.279> they're<00:00:25.490> not<00:00:25.610> perfect<00:00:26.090> for

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
rock and while they're not perfect for

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.120 
rock and while they're not perfect for
every<00:00:26.509> spot<00:00:26.779> in<00:00:26.900> the<00:00:26.990> landscape<00:00:27.169> there<00:00:28.009> are

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
every spot in the landscape there are

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.940 
every spot in the landscape there are
some<00:00:28.340> places<00:00:28.550> where<00:00:28.730> they<00:00:29.029> will<00:00:29.210> work<00:00:29.950> like

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
some places where they will work like

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.860 
some places where they will work like
here<00:00:31.220> in<00:00:31.310> this<00:00:31.369> Inferno<00:00:31.880> strip<00:00:32.239> this<00:00:32.689> is<00:00:32.840> a

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
here in this Inferno strip this is a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.320 
here in this Inferno strip this is a
good<00:00:33.110> example<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.739> an<00:00:33.860> area<00:00:34.190> where<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.210> know

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
good example of an area where you know

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.360 
good example of an area where you know
maybe<00:00:35.660> an<00:00:35.870> organic<00:00:36.320> mulch<00:00:36.500> might<00:00:36.860> not<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:37.190> the

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
maybe an organic mulch might not be the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.640 
maybe an organic mulch might not be the
best<00:00:37.580> situation<00:00:38.510> like<00:00:38.989> this<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.350> can<00:00:39.500> blow

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
best situation like this it can blow

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.500 
best situation like this it can blow
away<00:00:39.800> pretty<00:00:40.220> easy<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:40.850> harder<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.330> keep

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
away pretty easy and it's harder to keep

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.829 
away pretty easy and it's harder to keep
the<00:00:41.660> mulch<00:00:41.870> in<00:00:42.050> place<00:00:42.320> so<00:00:43.160> here<00:00:43.610> rock<00:00:44.330> mulch<00:00:44.600> is

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
the mulch in place so here rock mulch is

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.600 
the mulch in place so here rock mulch is
better<00:00:45.170> than<00:00:45.379> no<00:00:45.589> mulch<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.160> at<00:00:46.339> least<00:00:46.489> you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
better than no mulch and at least you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.189 
better than no mulch and at least you
get<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.790> little<00:00:47.089> bit<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.300> weed<00:00:47.449> suppression<00:00:47.780> and

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
get a little bit of weed suppression and

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.299 
get a little bit of weed suppression and
it<00:00:48.680> stays<00:00:48.920> put

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
it stays put

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.580 
it stays put
right<00:00:49.850> where<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.149> supposed<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.480> be<00:00:50.590> another

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
right where it's supposed to be another

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.650 
right where it's supposed to be another
really<00:00:51.770> good<00:00:52.129> idea<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:52.550> rock<00:00:53.149> mulch<00:00:53.420> in<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
really good idea for rock mulch in the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.200 
really good idea for rock mulch in the
landscape<00:00:54.110> is<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.739> make<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.950> dry<00:00:55.340> creek<00:00:55.699> bed<00:00:55.940> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
landscape is to make a dry creek bed and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.389 
landscape is to make a dry creek bed and
here<00:00:56.570> we've<00:00:56.750> got<00:00:56.930> kind<00:00:57.230> of<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:57.379> movement<00:00:57.739> in<00:00:58.280> the

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
here we've got kind of a movement in the

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.069 
here we've got kind of a movement in the
landscape<00:00:58.850> which<00:00:59.030> is<00:00:59.059> always<00:00:59.600> good<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.930> add

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
landscape which is always good to add

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.470 
landscape which is always good to add
makes<00:01:00.770> more<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.039> a<00:01:01.100> naturalistic<00:01:01.610> sense<00:01:02.120> out

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
makes more of a naturalistic sense out

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.020 
makes more of a naturalistic sense out
of<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.870> rock<00:01:03.230> material<00:01:03.859> and<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:04.520> course<00:01:04.729> we<00:01:04.879> have

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
of a rock material and of course we have

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.150 
of a rock material and of course we have
the<00:01:05.180> natural<00:01:05.600> mulch<00:01:05.810> off<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.229> side<00:01:06.470> to<00:01:07.009> really

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
the natural mulch off the side to really

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.740 
the natural mulch off the side to really
get<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.460> benefits<00:01:07.880> for<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.119> organic<00:01:08.630> matter

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
get the benefits for the organic matter

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.139 
get the benefits for the organic matter
and<00:01:09.050> to<00:01:09.890> modify<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.610> effects<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.060> the

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
and to modify the effects of the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.710 
and to modify the effects of the
perennials<00:01:11.539> there<00:01:11.720> too

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
perennials there too

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
perennials there too
now<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:14.780> you've<00:01:14.899> got<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:15.110> slope<00:01:15.470> in<00:01:15.619> your

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
now if you've got a slope in your

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.830 
now if you've got a slope in your
landscape<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.490> most<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.850> us<00:01:16.970> do<00:01:17.179> and<00:01:17.450> there's

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
landscape and most of us do and there's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.779 
landscape and most of us do and there's
a<00:01:17.899> path<00:01:18.110> through<00:01:18.410> it<00:01:18.530> then<00:01:19.009> pea<00:01:19.250> gravel<00:01:19.429> might

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
a path through it then pea gravel might

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:20.830 
a path through it then pea gravel might
work<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.119> really<00:01:20.300> well

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
work out really well

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.480 
work out really well
of<00:01:21.170> course<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> organic<00:01:21.950> mulch<00:01:22.159> could<00:01:22.340> also

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
of course the organic mulch could also

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.700 
of course the organic mulch could also
be<00:01:22.729> used<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:23.810> probably<00:01:24.200> more<00:01:24.439> likely

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
be used but this is probably more likely

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.080 
be used but this is probably more likely
a<00:01:25.009> more<00:01:25.369> permanent<00:01:25.610> solution<00:01:27.670> now<00:01:28.670> normally

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
a more permanent solution now normally

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.969 
a more permanent solution now normally
on<00:01:29.119> backyard<00:01:29.600> farm<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.350> really<00:01:30.770> don't

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
on backyard farm we really really don't

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.219 
on backyard farm we really really don't
recommend<00:01:31.310> using<00:01:31.729> crumb<00:01:32.540> rubber<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.140> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
recommend using crumb rubber in the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.109 
recommend using crumb rubber in the
landscape<00:01:33.799> but<00:01:34.430> there's<00:01:34.670> always<00:01:34.880> exceptions

Scout Tower probably an option for you

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.440 
Scout Tower probably an option for you
