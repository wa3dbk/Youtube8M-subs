00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 the one that youtube people are 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 memory with what this video tutorial 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.960
 in this opportunity I bring you what is 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 the plugin and I saw grÃ¼ber for cinema 4d that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.790
 basically what it does is not 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.560
 create a type of grass weed 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.820
 realistic in it is called 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.360
 the video information from a link 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.279
 the exams you are going to download that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 file and once it's downloaded 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.070
 that is not going to leave it this folder 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 is compressed 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.110
 let's give it right click extract here 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:45.190
 work what are two a folder and a 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 guild be here and in the folder that is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.280
 the important thing 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.790
 let's copy the famous right click 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.820
 copy and we will go to the routes 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:03.480
 where cinema 4d is stuck where 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.480
 the file system is installed 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.600
 all right 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 manson 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.979
 well in the program 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.990
 we have four of 14 here we get in 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.259
 the folder flows and we hit this 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.259
 binder 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.020
 and we close we open our cinema more 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.380
 we already know we create for example I was going to 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.399
 create a flat world 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399
 modified the size 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.840
 here we have our plan or we are going to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.690
 flow and give homework to the island 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.060
 includes errors 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.930
 if it does not work out that something will be bad 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.250
 well this one we are going to plugin and not 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.250
 we click where it says books 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.720
 here we see that we can see with the size 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.170
 of the grass 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.930
 well let's say road and we're going to give and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.080
 where we want that in the part of the plane 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.140
 where we want to start the grass 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.120
 for example I will put here in the center 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.740
 when we get that little point if it's 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 because we already have as selected the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.570
 area to go down where it says growth in and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.180
 there starts to create what they are like 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.180
 the roots 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.790
 we can do everything we want and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.609
 once we have results that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:42.760
 we want enough event comes out this and we 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.760
 let's go to the brito tab and here we give 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:50.570
 and we see that he does not believe what is the weed 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.570
 we can make a return 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 or we can simply delete the plane and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.390
 we have what is weed alone 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.439
 well that was it for this page 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.239
 tutorial I hope you subscribe 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.239
