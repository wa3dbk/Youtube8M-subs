00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 I am simon new muscle maker 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.370
 Together with Sarah I show you today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.990
 a nice a work out what your home 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 You can do it right when you 're at home 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.809
 of course, it is important that trained 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.820
 It's such a little bit 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.559
 equipment is also just adding for one 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.000
 isolated training the arms that want 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.730
 you need training in isolation 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 at least a dumbbell yes tell me 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.130
 our dumbbells how can we 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.150
 partly as a doorstop 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.500
 it would be best to use it, of course 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.939
 if you are still copied that goes 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.350
 Do not break the door but that's it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 actually an investment in the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 beautiful new illness and eternity 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.380
 exactly if you just have the opportunity 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.730
 Has the eternal to use this iron 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 will not be heavier or lighter with 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 the time so you can still 100 years 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.350
 with this trade train so one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.059
 Link to this I pack you and the video 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.680
 if you have no short definitely 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.450
 otherwise it simply will not work 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 and I would suggest yes you can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.440
 the boys ever the first exercise 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
 show or the name of course yes 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 of course, the ladies as well 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.329
 Of course, ladies certainly 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 first the first exercise we do the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 Concentration calls so we do the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.789
 Sarah does not explain what 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 you have to pay attention you know yes I can 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.489
 yourself not yet in training 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 that's why today is sarah 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.769
 as my assistant as it were 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.330
 Can I even say that yes 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.490
 Me also your wife eva mendes too 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.170
 okay okay 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 So we agree on that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.240
 ever the starting position sarah 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.950
 court against her thigh that is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.990
 the starting position is already clear 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.280
 the back reasonably straight so 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.750
 Do not make a cat hump here now 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 that's very important for me 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.200
 training partner or someone over it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.720
 let everything go back the first 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 slightly bent so that is now 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 not straight but very important 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.960
 no cat hump then do here 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.299
 the arm goes down and down there so 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.909
 ultimately over the ellenbogengelenk 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.200
 you go against the inside of yours 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.939
 thigh so you see that at 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.479
 sarah so well and now we catch 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.740
 on with the concentration cross 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.049
 very important in the concentration 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.210
 calls so you have the opportunity to 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.340
 handle during the movement execution 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.869
 Altering her sarahs biceps is for 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.670
 female arm pretty good 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.810
 pronounced you can see here very nice and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.460
 above all, I'm just taking hold here 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 the inside of the biceps 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.409
 you still notice the topic even further 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.259
 finally stronger on top 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.179
 You see, I can do it myself and me 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.129
 remember that right here all the more 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.110
 gets even more here in the rotation 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.319
 So yes, the rotation is in the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.819
 wrists reason instead 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.709
 the biceps in the 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.670
 inside also out and that feels 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.890
 of course, when I'm here especially 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.769
 against here so you see one before 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.670
 anatomy sarah definitely good 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.950
 Blessed you can not say is 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.239
 of course, all the hard work that you do 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.950
 Arriving aleks does not want to start from today 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.540
 Tomorrow I have to say honestly if that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 woman is what is always very difficult 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.180
 nice to get the biceps there 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.160
 you work for a long time but enough of that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.410
 home the next one stretches out 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.819
 The next exercise is similar to ours 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.319
 just showed so that was the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.360
 Concentrating girls with this 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.549
 especially good just to turn the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200
 the biceps in the complete complex too 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.730
 train and just now also on 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.379
 end of all beautiful here for 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 make sure that the ball gets fat me 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.829
 Let's show the hammer source 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.209
 Variant to that so sarah goes again 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.129
 just as it said with 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.109
 reasonably straight back against the 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.790
 inside of the thigh against and 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.290
 now, however, does not find any 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.329
 move more in the wrist instead of that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.370
 means neutral handle with these 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.579
 neutral handle all considered important 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.440
 really not on the lead here 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.299
 movement in the wrist has sarah the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.709
 possibility beside the biceps on the 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.540
 Calculator everything only to train with 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.980
 means the biceps he will also be one 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.840
 a bit pushed out that's sort of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.310
 such a small trick with the biceps 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.260
 Just train the brachial dick 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.419
 make with the biceps even thicker 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.700
 Acts and these are the hammer curls 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.109
 yes of course very important of this 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.220
 I would recommend hammer curls 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.669
 you do as well as with the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.569
 Concentration curls three sentences twelve 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.609
 repeats 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.530
 then you have six in total 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.880
 each twelve repetitions for 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.079
 the biceps already done enough 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.180
 Of course we can do that too 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.459
 training the triceps would also 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.139
 say what she suggests 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.579
 So I prefer this variant 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.370
 the weight is not here now either 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.540
 in the end, if you already 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 is there 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.500
 to put the hand behind sarah 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.159
 do not exercise now 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.989
 irritate 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.069
 Sarah trained now lets the elbows 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.200
 Together I hope you are fine 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.120
 recognize very important the exercises are 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.430
 close to the body so not far away 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.409
 spread and now you push that high 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.840
 Whole is to move with one 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.609
 Dumbbell over your head and here 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.380
 There is no movement, that is to say 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.120
 the upper arms remain during the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.740
 entire movement execution static 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.900
 and the elbows close to the head so range of 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.310
 Motion Gesche relatively low but that 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.099
 is not wild because it works 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.750
 really about this movement process 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.419
 completely to follow along nicely 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.280
 the above with the album exactly it goes 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.590
 therefore simply the movement sequence 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.180
 control and in this area yourself 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.009
 to move where really pressure on the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.630
 Muscle is where the right one had to start 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.370
 to score because it is not about it 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.750
 somehow the biggest possible dream too 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.669
 to do that is really just possible 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.410
 to control this weight and 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.880
 to move in the area where the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.440
 growth rate is added 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.389
 he is a super exercise just this one 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.270
 this handle you can show it 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.070
 how you got it short when you look at it 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.169
 properly how you deal with it 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.300
 have exactly so sarah sums it up 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.949
 so to speak in this variant is can 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.810
 I would always recommend 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.930
 that's my trick you 're doing 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.050
 with thumbs and forefingers why 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.790
 So a prisma makes everyone here like this 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.100
 there you have the possibility 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.480
 also to cross to scratch 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.010
 you have the highest possible security 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.120
 as well as sarah did that is 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.639
 of course you have to be okay 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.680
 just try a bit yourself 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.120
 I also think, and if you own only 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.710
 tried it as it did for him 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.020
 best works then anyway 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.270
 It's always best to do that yourself 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.169
 assess and if you still open it 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.150
 a roof terrace then makes you know 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.280
 what you did so very important 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.139
 In this biceps and triceps training 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.150
 really take care that they are in the 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.560
 areas where the muscle burns 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.940
 it's not about the less 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.680
 movement radius to drive but 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.330
 really go in this area where 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.070
 the growth stimulus is set that is 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.600
 the a and the o and otherwise natural 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.889
 still very important in the video 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.510
 Descriptions are still a few channels 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.070
 earned related to jim unit can 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.630
 Of course, you also subscribe to sarahs 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.150
 clearly now I would suggest 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.700
 we'll see each other in the next video 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.700
 larger sarah and hairstyles
