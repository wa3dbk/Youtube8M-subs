have multiple systems involved it's
usually<00:00:27.410> leads<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:27.980> electrical<00:00:28.610> problem

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
usually leads to electrical problem

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.850 
usually leads to electrical problem

bulb check airbags on abs is on court
the<00:01:01.260> seat<00:01:01.469> belt<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:01.979> not<00:01:02.129> wearing

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
the seat belt because I'm not wearing

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.520 
the seat belt because I'm not wearing
one<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.000> we're<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.869> moving<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
one right here we're not moving so we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
one right here we're not moving so we
can't<00:01:04.820> verify<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.119> speedometer<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.470> we're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
can't verify the speedometer but we're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.779 
can't verify the speedometer but we're
gonna<00:01:07.740> take<00:01:07.920> his<00:01:08.039> word<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.580> that's

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
gonna take his word for it that that's

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:10.419 
gonna take his word for it that that's
not<00:01:09.119> working<00:01:09.330> either

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
not working either

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.639 
not working either
so<00:01:11.429> shutting<00:01:11.759> it<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.200> we're<00:01:13.200> gonna<00:01:13.259> go<00:01:13.500> back

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
so shutting it off we're gonna go back

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.200 
so shutting it off we're gonna go back
to<00:01:13.679> start<00:01:14.159> with<00:01:14.399> the<00:01:14.549> first<00:01:14.789> thing<00:01:15.060> that's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to start with the first thing that's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.419 
to start with the first thing that's
probably<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> easiest<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.470> us<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> check

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.820 

to<00:01:23.429> confirm<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.209> that<00:01:24.360> complaint<00:01:24.840> we've

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to confirm part of that complaint we've

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.249 
to confirm part of that complaint we've
got<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> blower<00:01:26.310> motor<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.690> that's<00:01:28.049> not

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
got the blower motor on and that's not

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
got the blower motor on and that's not
working<00:01:28.549> I'm<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.789> go<00:01:29.880> through<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
working I'm going to go through the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.529 
working I'm going to go through the
windows<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:31.709> the<00:01:32.670> power<00:01:32.909> windows<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.390> not

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
windows and the power windows are not

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.340 
windows and the power windows are not
working<00:01:33.929> either<00:01:35.780> we're<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
working either we're gonna go to the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.340 
working either we're gonna go to the
blower<00:01:37.560> motor<00:01:37.860> fuse<00:01:38.810> which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.959> right<00:01:40.170> over

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
blower motor fuse which is right over

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.109 
blower motor fuse which is right over
here<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.179> using<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.270> power<00:01:42.450> probe<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:44.880> test

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
here and using the power probe we test

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.889 
here and using the power probe we test
the<00:01:45.240> blower<00:01:45.450> motor<00:01:45.780> fuse<00:01:46.170> we've<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.250> ground

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
the blower motor fuse we've got ground

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
the blower motor fuse we've got ground
and<00:01:48.899> ground<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.440> both<00:01:49.470> sides<00:01:50.039> now<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.179> should

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and ground on both sides now that should

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.050 
and ground on both sides now that should
have<00:01:51.599> power<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.310> power<00:01:53.489> widows<00:01:53.910> are

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
have power the power widows are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.509 
have power the power widows are
controlled<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.629> circuit<00:01:55.050> breaker<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:56.369> we're

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:56.519 
controlled by a circuit breaker so we're

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:02.089 
controlled by a circuit breaker so we're
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> check<00:01:56.849> that<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:58.590> pull<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.009> out<00:02:01.099> we

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.099 
going to check that we pull it out we

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.690 
going to check that we pull it out we
have<00:02:02.220> ground<00:02:03.319> and<00:02:04.319> ground<00:02:04.619> no<00:02:05.009> power<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.550> that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
have ground and ground no power to that

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.759 
have ground and ground no power to that
either

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:06.769 
either

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.290 
either
so<00:02:07.769> before<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.340> start<00:02:08.369> checking<00:02:08.849> everything

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so before we start checking everything

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
so before we start checking everything
else<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.690> know<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.080> got<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> problem<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.920> no

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
else we know we got a problem there no

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.180 
else we know we got a problem there no
power<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> circuit<00:02:12.830> we're<00:02:13.830> gonna<00:02:13.980> go<00:02:14.129> to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
power to that circuit we're gonna go to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.680 
power to that circuit we're gonna go to

so we've gone ahead here and taking the

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.599 
so we've gone ahead here and taking the
panels<00:03:13.269> off<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.689> we<00:03:13.840> can<00:03:14.019> get<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.129> so<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.370> can

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
panels off that we can get you so we can

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.420 
panels off that we can get you so we can
test<00:03:15.790> that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.820 

one<00:03:20.430> thing<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.700> want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.940> tell<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:22.680> a

one thing I want to tell you it's a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.710 
one thing I want to tell you it's a
mistake<00:03:23.130> I've<00:03:23.340> made<00:03:23.370> many<00:03:23.910> times<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.660> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
mistake I've made many times to when I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.590 
mistake I've made many times to when I
first<00:03:24.960> started<00:03:25.520> they've<00:03:26.520> got<00:03:26.730> some<00:03:27.330> type<00:03:27.570> of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
first started they've got some type of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.930 
first started they've got some type of
they<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.560> market<00:03:28.950> an<00:03:29.040> alarm<00:03:29.400> system<00:03:29.670> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
they have to market an alarm system in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420 
they have to market an alarm system in
here<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.990> easy<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.440> say<00:03:31.620> all<00:03:31.830> well<00:03:32.100> somebody

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
here it's easy to say all well somebody

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.950 
here it's easy to say all well somebody
who<00:03:32.580> installed<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.150> made<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:33.360> mistake<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
who installed that made a mistake and

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840 
who installed that made a mistake and
that's<00:03:34.020> what<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.320> problem<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.770> surely<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
that's what the problem is surely it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.150 
that's what the problem is surely it
could<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.270> but<00:03:37.170> I'm<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.680> sure<00:03:37.710> we<00:03:38.100> should

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
could be but I'm not so sure we should

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.520 
could be but I'm not so sure we should
jump<00:03:38.460> to<00:03:38.550> that<00:03:38.700> conclusion<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:39.390> away<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.380> we

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
jump to that conclusion right away so we

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530 
jump to that conclusion right away so we
wanted<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.860> just<00:03:41.190> assume<00:03:41.520> that<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.000> was<00:03:42.180> okay

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
wanted to just assume that that was okay

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.240 
wanted to just assume that that was okay
and<00:03:42.750> rule<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.170> other<00:03:43.380> things<00:03:43.590> first

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
and rule out the other things first

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.510 
and rule out the other things first

obviously<00:04:14.570> this<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.870> feeding<00:04:15.410> that<00:04:15.560> part<00:04:15.890> of

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
obviously this is feeding that part of

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.490 
obviously this is feeding that part of
the<00:04:16.130> circuit<00:04:16.550> but<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.600> also<00:04:17.840> want<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.200> do<00:04:18.350> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
the circuit but I also want to do is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.500 
the circuit but I also want to do is
plug<00:04:18.770> this<00:04:18.920> in<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:21.320> bowl<00:04:21.440> holders<00:04:21.860> working

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
plug this in to the bowl holders working

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.510 
plug this in to the bowl holders working
then<00:04:24.290> come<00:04:24.470> up<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.710> see<00:04:24.950> if<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.160> took<00:04:25.280> care<00:04:25.490> of

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
then come up and see if it took care of

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.900 
then come up and see if it took care of
my<00:04:25.610> abs<00:04:26.090> problem<00:04:26.570> they're<00:04:26.930> back<00:04:27.170> brother

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
my abs problem they're back brother

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.260 
my abs problem they're back brother
so<00:04:28.910> now<00:04:29.060> with<00:04:29.270> our<00:04:29.500> wire<00:04:30.500> plug<00:04:30.860> back<00:04:31.070> in<00:04:31.400> and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
so now with our wire plug back in and

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.940 
so now with our wire plug back in and
the<00:04:32.360> blower<00:04:32.540> motor<00:04:32.870> working<00:04:33.320> I'm<00:04:33.440> gonna<00:04:33.530> start

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
the blower motor working I'm gonna start

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:42.899 
the blower motor working I'm gonna start
it

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.269 

and<00:04:43.119> you<00:04:43.479> can<00:04:43.659> see<00:04:43.809> our<00:04:44.020> brake<00:04:44.529> and<00:04:44.740> airbag<00:04:45.069> and

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
and you can see our brake and airbag and

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.999 
and you can see our brake and airbag and
ABS<00:04:45.580> lights<00:04:45.879> are<00:04:46.059> off<00:04:46.499> but<00:04:47.499> if<00:04:47.589> I<00:04:47.709> happen<00:04:47.860> to

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
ABS lights are off but if I happen to

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.329 
ABS lights are off but if I happen to
reach<00:04:48.189> down<00:04:48.459> there<00:04:48.669> and<00:04:48.789> pull<00:04:48.969> this<00:04:49.179> wire<00:04:49.629> out

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:50.339 
reach down there and pull this wire out

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:55.070 
reach down there and pull this wire out
the<00:04:51.339> blower<00:04:51.550> motor<00:04:51.849> will<00:04:52.059> stop

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.219 

maybe<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:56.379> like<00:04:57.449> an<00:04:58.449> airbag<00:04:58.779> light<00:04:59.050> will

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
maybe it's like an airbag light will

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.499 
maybe it's like an airbag light will
come<00:04:59.409> back<00:04:59.529> on<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.639> clearly<00:05:00.939> this<00:05:01.179> is<00:05:01.240> the

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
come back on so clearly this is the

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.339 
come back on so clearly this is the
problem<00:05:03.240> okay<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.659> order<00:05:04.809> to<00:05:05.050> make<00:05:05.199> this

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
problem okay so in order to make this

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.350 
problem okay so in order to make this
repair<00:05:05.770> we're<00:05:05.949> going<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.099> use<00:05:06.279> our<00:05:06.520> terminal

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
repair we're going to use our terminal

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.029 
repair we're going to use our terminal
tool<00:05:07.629> probe<00:05:08.559> and<00:05:10.080> push<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.229> in<00:05:11.349> here<00:05:11.619> and<00:05:11.770> push

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
tool probe and push it in here and push

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.449 
tool probe and push it in here and push
that<00:05:12.219> terminal<00:05:12.999> connector<00:05:13.419> out<00:05:13.629> of<00:05:13.839> the

that terminal connector out of the

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:21.509 
that terminal connector out of the
wiring<00:05:15.459> connector<00:05:19.979> now<00:05:20.979> you<00:05:21.039> can<00:05:21.249> see<00:05:21.399> the

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:21.519 
wiring connector now you can see the

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:23.129 
wiring connector now you can see the
problem<00:05:21.909> with<00:05:22.089> it<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.330> wire<00:05:22.509> just<00:05:22.719> broke<00:05:22.929> off

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
problem with it the wire just broke off

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.350 
problem with it the wire just broke off
of<00:05:23.379> the<00:05:23.499> terminal<00:05:23.889> connector<00:05:24.339> so<00:05:25.089> we're<00:05:25.240> going

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.049 
connector out crimp the wire back in it
but<00:05:35.949> to<00:05:36.069> make<00:05:36.189> it<00:05:36.249> even<00:05:36.459> better<00:05:36.729> we're<00:05:36.969> going

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:37.059 
but to make it even better we're going

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:41.669 
but to make it even better we're going
to<00:05:37.149> solder<00:05:37.419> it<00:05:37.659> together<00:05:40.409> we've<00:05:41.409> got<00:05:41.439> this

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:41.679 
to solder it together we've got this

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:43.980 
to solder it together we've got this
little<00:05:41.979> device<00:05:42.129> this<00:05:42.550> kind<00:05:42.789> of<00:05:42.849> handy<00:05:43.179> helps

back<00:06:07.420> into<00:06:07.660> the<00:06:07.810> connector

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.800 

everything<00:06:47.760> should<00:06:47.910> snap<00:06:48.240> back<00:06:48.450> in<00:06:48.600> place

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
everything should snap back in place

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.330 
everything should snap back in place
when<00:06:49.050> it's<00:06:49.080> incorrectly<00:06:52.040> another<00:06:53.040> thing<00:06:53.250> to

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
when it's incorrectly another thing to

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.700 
when it's incorrectly another thing to
be<00:06:53.430> careful<00:06:53.820> here<00:06:54.120> is<00:06:54.960> make<00:06:55.230> sure<00:06:55.500> that

be careful here is make sure that

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.040 
be careful here is make sure that
there's<00:06:55.950> enough<00:06:56.090> slack<00:06:57.090> on<00:06:57.390> that<00:06:57.540> wire<00:06:57.780> so

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
there's enough slack on that wire so

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.420 
there's enough slack on that wire so
when<00:06:58.200> they<00:06:58.320> turn<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.680> tilt<00:06:58.950> steering<00:06:59.250> wheel

when they turn the tilt steering wheel

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.180 
when they turn the tilt steering wheel
it<00:07:00.090> won't<00:07:00.390> pull<00:07:00.570> that<00:07:00.600> wire<00:07:00.930> out<00:07:00.990> again<00:07:04.190> you

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
it won't pull that wire out again you

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:23.140 
it won't pull that wire out again you
turn<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:05.580> key<00:07:05.730> on<00:07:09.770> blower<00:07:10.770> motor<00:07:11.070> works

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.690 

Windows<00:07:24.150> is<00:07:24.300> up<00:07:24.450> and<00:07:24.570> down<00:07:27.080> everything<00:07:28.080> fixed

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
Windows is up and down everything fixed

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.580 
Windows is up and down everything fixed
now<00:07:29.700> we<00:07:29.760> didn't<00:07:30.150> use<00:07:30.270> the<00:07:30.450> scanner<00:07:30.750> on<00:07:31.050> this<00:07:31.350> I

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
now we didn't use the scanner on this I

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.990 
now we didn't use the scanner on this I
knew<00:07:32.220> there<00:07:32.370> were<00:07:32.460> going<00:07:32.580> to<00:07:32.640> be<00:07:32.760> a<00:07:32.790> lot<00:07:32.970> of

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
knew there were going to be a lot of

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.780 
knew there were going to be a lot of
codes<00:07:33.330> but<00:07:34.169> you<00:07:34.890> do<00:07:35.040> need<00:07:35.280> to<00:07:35.400> get<00:07:35.580> your

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:35.790
