00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.589
 Munich Airport Seventeenth of February 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 overnight, the second largest airport in Germany has a bizarre 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.650
 Transformed snowscape 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.899
 in three shifts, each with 150 employees attempt the winter service 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.289
 the four million square meter area is snow-free 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.779
 to keep 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.550
 on the control tower there must be a lot of hustle and bustle every minute 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.010
 the air traffic controllers adapt to new situations the Enhanced External Hard 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 Case but today very heavy snowfall that is percent 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.430
 She had a lot of snow on Katharinenberg 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.590
 Accordingly, we are in close cooperation with the Croat 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.100
 Coordinate cleaning of the plant areas but look that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 the radio traffic is monitored as quickly as possible 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.170
 the Munich airport operates two parallel like 4000 meter long and 60 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.900
 Meter wide runways 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.110
 Air traffic controller Last come is currently responsible for the railway system North 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 Robots the party entry accompaniment celebrated 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.920
 like the more than three millimeters slush on a startup and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.689
 Runway 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.000
 this will be closed 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.330
 Starting machines could not by the increased rolling resistance 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.810
 necessary speed to take off 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380
 landing aircraft could easily get into a skid and slip 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 the winter maintenance experts are working hard 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 this overlay dosing technology there within 30 minutes 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.270
 Alone with us is also to rooms and de-icing that will 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.060
 summer conditions for at least some time 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 a whole armada of special vehicles is used 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.190
 At night, the piled snow masses are loaded onto trucks and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.600
 transported away and recycled environmentally friendly in special filter systems 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.880
 the stronger the snowfall the lower the number of possible 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 Takeoffs and landings 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.490
 necessarily corresponding 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.840
 it is thus agreed that the sale of a capacity could work 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.949
 and in heavy snowfall and very adverse weather conditions may 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.079
 halve capacity at once 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.499
 normally the Stuttgart 30 flight movements will be processed Red 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.789
 Bull are then also the restrictions for all parties 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.849
 Shift supervisor Mattie Ross on longer coordinates the work in the tower 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:39.729
 At the moment, both railway systems are used alternately while the northern railway 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.329
 the southern runway is cleared for flight operations 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:49.810
 FC St still while the northern runway is cleared by the winter service 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.990
 the first machines come on the finger the occasion release 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.819
 that astonishes 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.639
 can promptly have 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.580
 at Ferrari 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.710
 for Copenhagen Anke Ebner, Pocher moved to Papenburg's boxer and six 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.419
 imaginations 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.239
 Title of Michelin 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.930
 since they forgave us so much we did not cultivate the airplane 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.039
 Run unnecessarily long engines 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:14.259
 let stand on the beach town of Bern 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:15.369
 this means 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:16.549
 we calculate 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.699
 the time 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.149
 for the occasion release 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.229
 Since it optimally adapted to the time where the plane is on the 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.119
 Actually lost track 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.199
 after the grief has given the occasion release, the apron takes over 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.669
 Control the command she leads the plane safely across the apron to the 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.849
 Runways but still the runway north I am not free Jesendorf 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.879
 Before each takeoff and before each landing, the pilots ask for the big one 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.160
 Condition of the runway 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.190
 Lars Gromball gets an overview of the status of the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.190
 Clearing work on a successful 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.819
 and then they also do the same several times 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:56.939
 ca 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.449
 in the grip of the runway will determine that 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 so-called Fritsche NCAA used 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.439
 we want to show that we are able to speak for ourselves 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:11.979
 we'll see 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.409
 Friction measured 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.409
 you expect 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.970
 the ground conditions of the runways are for takeoffs and landings of 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.279
 great importance 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.770
 he brakes value must voices 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.020
 as well as aircraft brake to a large extent with the wheels 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.340
 the measured data of the political chaos immediately become mourned by radio 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.999
 passed on 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.360
 Huber 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.830
 the airport 5 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.500
 Incidentally, the continent is already practiced Dessau in the institution it is 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.740
 6 1 7 3 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.139
 7 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.809
 2 hours before 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:51.389
 but who still concept to 6 we have to gut the current building 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.389
 to be let 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.819
 There the Hessin sat 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.819
 Dr. HR 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.289
 not only the runways but also the planes have to ice before the start 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.819
 and snow are released 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.580
 an icing on wings or light works 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.550
 the EU would dangerously degrade the Amish properties of the aircraft 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.150
 In addition, you will receive a total of Bangkok per start 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.889
 for Prien so stations 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.979
 the aircraft are charged so that percent the waiting time before those iron 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.990
 Station not too big than that the aircraft is relatively fast to a solution 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.759
 coming 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.300
 and according to the prices we get from the vehicle for the information like 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.759
 For a long time the plane is regarded as a duck That is to say question from when he with his 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.770
 Vehicle must be in the air 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.340
 to finally settle again new ICE or according to snowfall on the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.009
 Impacts precipitates 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.090
 In two steps, the aircraft is made ready to go 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.529
 First, the ice is dipped in hot water 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.710
 then luck is distributed without any mixture on the wings 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.710
 to protect the machine from renewed 4 1 and 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.710
 All these delays must be the pilots in the tower in their temporal 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.249
 Consider planning 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.530
 the big house photo of course animals 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.569
 Special situations winter operation he 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:11.639
 Lord over 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.159
 Of course, good teamwork is necessary for good cooperation 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.270
 and, of course, Dendermonde's good concentration is talking briskly 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.270
 Hiccup here, of course, today significantly reduced percent 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.300
 the clearance crew changes the sides 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.749
 in total, the two tracks will be closed three times each day 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:38.139
 however, only 50 of over 600 planned flights had to be canceled 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.070
 through the well-established cooperation of air traffic control and winter service 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.020
 could be prevented a chaos in the air traffic at the Munich airport
