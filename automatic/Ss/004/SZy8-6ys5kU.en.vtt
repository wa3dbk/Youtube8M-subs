00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello my name is Victoria and in this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.569
 video i want to tell you about how i 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.919
 I make French onion pie with me 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.570
 there was such an opportunity going to 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 parents to the country and I wanted for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.710
 them something for tea to cook them 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.540
 once making a birthday in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.029
 french style let's say so and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.279
 onion soup or onion pie onion itself I 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.920
 previously could not bear but tried 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.650
 this cake I really liked it 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.080
 very easy to prepare and also 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.080
 very small set of ingredients for 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 it is required first of all this dough dough 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 i will use puff ordinary 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 puff pastry can be yeast there any 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 I can not stand when the manufacturer 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.450
 such small pieces for weight to us 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 time is the point is that I will 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.390
 use this one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.829
 glass cake pan so all 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 I will just share the mass of this test 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 I roll in half in the reservoir and which 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 in size will fit this form 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 it's about the dough on the main 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.090
 the ingredient is onion onion and maybe 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 seem like a lot but in fact he 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 all uvarsya u roast in general in the pie 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.530
 it will not be as much as it seems 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 initially next you need an egg 2 eggs 1 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 egg yolk to coat the pie 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 in principle, not necessary such and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 thing for beauty for crisp 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.619
 crust let's say yellow curd not 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 curd cheese cheese goes well naturally 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.460
 when the frenchman cooks such a pie he 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.720
 they must have super cheeses there 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.030
 different mostly they use 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 some soft white mozzarella cheese 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 goat cheese and I took the usual Adyghe 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.009
 diced 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.290
 I have mushrooms here mushrooms in this 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.220
 the pie does not go but I just found myself 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.409
 some 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.210
 mushrooms and decided their simple country 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.670
 I will also add white pepper and 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 a little salt prince food part first 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 I will begin to worry about all this 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:59.850
 on service with small onion rings 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.219
 big bowl went basically i 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.549
 shred not so much of it 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.790
 onion looks now you need what you need 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.790
 mushrooms 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:16.670
 Sensitivity was she quietly they 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.700
 there got it expensive bikes now 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:31.240
 quick and all mushroom pashin 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:45.890
 codes send the same lay out 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:48.290
 cheese and we need to break you know i 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.970
 first when she cooked the very first time 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.959
 it seemed to me that this was going to be 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 little with yes such a mask but then yes I 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.000
 put all the same 3 it turned out so 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.470
 you or four even me too much 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 it turned out 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.239
 and the liquid just flowed big 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.860
 quantities I still wanted for the first time 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.200
 drink it all just on silicone 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.790
 big shape so that later it is easier 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.970
 It was all this but today 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.060
 I added more cheese mushrooms, that's why 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:29.840
 a lot more you need to do already 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:35.630
 yolk casting broke well at least 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.820
 a little bit so that I remain this part no 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.790
 too little now i'll take one more 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.570
 testicle attempt number 2 I got 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.880
 so normal yolk I save a 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.320
 I look at the consistency in 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.930
 principle that's thomas which i have 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.510
 It turned out because of the broken eggs 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.470
 I see that here is a little dry and 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.470
 so I add more here 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.880
 stir 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.570
 she should be so little 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.570
 wet 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:23.130
 all successfully turned out a little pepper then 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:34.030
 for a long time a little bit as it solves itself 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:37.360
 pupils generally like pepper 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.030
 buy in egypt such benches 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 cool sold come in there and 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.419
 just eyes run up and there still 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.880
 vanilla cool with them too 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.919
 and fun to bargain and right there and 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.150
 green and red white pepper in general 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.850
 like coins here then salt too 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.979
 as if every taste how much to whom 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.139
 Naturally all this is high quality 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:05.440
 shuffled well and then I just 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:08.979
 I'll do the rolling dough, we start the dough 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.130
 I will make the dough roll out on my own 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.600
 favorite silicone mat bought myself 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.820
 probably about two years ago such a rolling pin he 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.289
 just delighted with her on her sort of 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.240
 nothing sticks but give of course 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:26.050
 accidents but in principle she is in this 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.370
 the main power we take the dough with an eye 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:39.599
 cancel half 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:44.410
 and just half to the bottom for size 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:47.889
 under this form there she set aside it turned out 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.169
 here is such a thin edge uneven 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.030
 where it sticks out then I just protect first 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.169
 but then and then already that down will not be me 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.590
 remove but it turns out that we spread 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.590
 filling form 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:39.710
 sky silence 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:43.260
 but such aroma is delicious onion package 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.250
 Here you laid out just 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.190
 leveled well, and then roll out more 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:54.420
 one layer just to cover 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.980
 on top and pinch here patty me 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.810
 It turned out this is now necessary in order 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.500
 so that he doesn't all become such a beer 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.930
 necessary and pierce the race well 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.490
 then there will be only 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.100
 smear the eggs here the oven I already 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.660
 turned on so she heated up I will 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.120
 bake first at 180 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.650
 degrees well, there I will look like a crust 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.130
 redden and then probably go to 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.510
 110 degrees on the same will not bake it 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.240
 I think I know him well spent 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.520
 maximum 30 minutes in the oven in order 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.650
 to completely he already 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.110
 sent very thin so they 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.500
 bake quickly here we cover it all 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.500
 yolk and oven 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:01.199
 all my sister would say so 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:04.470
 ready only to be in the oven 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:07.970
 I got this pie 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.970
 but do not wish to be angry to all bye
