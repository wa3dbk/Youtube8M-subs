00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.209
 Okayama city 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.209
 Just talks 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.869
 Closing ceremony is seven days 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.730
 Ribbed 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 When I think that I will bring it at this time 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.449
 I made a successful bid for now 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 If you put in the car harmonics as it was the point of Matsuzaka 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.510
 Takaga knife is high and high 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 Also at this time 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.930
 There are many from the front, but let's say from the fork 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.010
 cafp 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 In the middle 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 So here too 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 Roughly 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
 I'm in good health now 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.590
 I'm going to Ogura on the 19th 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.750
 If you do 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 This is how it used to be 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 There is no Tashiro minor 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.840
 Please come by all means 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 I went to this 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 This is flat with this 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.880
 Put on next 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 It does not mean that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 Even if you say Sujini 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.709
 I think I have to use 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.709
 Intertwined 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:17.059
 I'm tired 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.929
 Further 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.099
 I also got help from last summer 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.099
 When I go 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.989
 Saga for the tournament 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.429
 And even if there is thickness
