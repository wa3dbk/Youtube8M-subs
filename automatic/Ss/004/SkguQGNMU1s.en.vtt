okay<00:00:05.540> in<00:00:05.689> this<00:00:05.810> step<00:00:05.990> on<00:00:06.410> your<00:00:07.160> other<00:00:07.430> terminal

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
okay in this step on your other terminal

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.730 
okay in this step on your other terminal
here<00:00:08.450> you're<00:00:08.570> going<00:00:08.690> to<00:00:08.750> put<00:00:08.840> another<00:00:09.110> ring<00:00:09.440> on

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
here you're going to put another ring on

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.529 
here you're going to put another ring on
it<00:00:10.900> on<00:00:11.900> your<00:00:11.959> blue<00:00:12.410> wire<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.089> why<00:00:14.089> you're<00:00:14.299> here

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
it on your blue wire and why you're here

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.699 
it on your blue wire and why you're here
because<00:00:14.749> you<00:00:14.900> can<00:00:15.019> do<00:00:15.079> these<00:00:15.230> both<00:00:15.440> at<00:00:15.619> the

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
because you can do these both at the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.170 
because you can do these both at the
same<00:00:15.950> time<00:00:15.980> you're<00:00:16.400> going<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.550> put<00:00:16.700> a<00:00:16.730> quarter

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
same time you're going to put a quarter

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.730 
same time you're going to put a quarter
inch<00:00:17.420> a<00:00:18.430> plug<00:00:19.430> in<00:00:19.699> on<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:20.990> other<00:00:21.080> end<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
inch a plug in on the other end of the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.060 
inch a plug in on the other end of the
red<00:00:21.920> red<00:00:22.880> wire<00:00:23.120> and<00:00:23.480> that<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.140> slides<00:00:24.770> over

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
red red wire and that just slides over

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.170 
red red wire and that just slides over
the<00:00:25.310> end<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.670> your<00:00:26.260> temperature<00:00:27.340> to<00:00:28.340> cinder

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
the end of your temperature to cinder

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.480 
the end of your temperature to cinder
excuse<00:00:29.480> me<00:00:29.690> another<00:00:30.620> one<00:00:30.800> just<00:00:30.980> screws<00:00:31.250> on

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
excuse me another one just screws on

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.069 
excuse me another one just screws on
here<00:00:31.880> because<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:32.270> were<00:00:32.540> getting<00:00:32.899> ready<00:00:32.989> to

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
here because we were getting ready to

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.139 
here because we were getting ready to
hook<00:00:33.289> those<00:00:33.469> up<00:00:33.530> right<00:00:34.250> now<00:00:34.550> without<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
hook those up right now without the

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:44.160 
hook those up right now without the
power<00:00:35.360> but<00:00:35.990> uh<00:00:36.040> okay<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:37.070> let's<00:00:37.520> go<00:00:38.090> do<00:00:38.270> that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.760 

okay<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.590> other<00:00:45.739> blue<00:00:46.130> wire<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:48.410> can<00:00:48.649> be

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
okay so the other blue wire this can be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.600 
okay so the other blue wire this can be
really<00:00:49.040> hard<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.399> see<00:00:50.500> another<00:00:51.500> blue<00:00:51.860> wire

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
really hard to see another blue wire

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.080 
really hard to see another blue wire
what<00:00:53.360> you<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.500> going<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:54.739> go<00:00:55.059> into<00:00:56.059> your

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
what you have is going to go into your

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.590 
what you have is going to go into your
gauge<00:00:56.450> and<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:56.840> going<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.989> hook<00:00:57.200> up<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.770> s

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
gauge and it's going to hook up to the s

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.080 
gauge and it's going to hook up to the s
and<00:00:59.600> just<00:00:59.750> plug<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:01.040> S<00:01:01.280> terminal

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
and just plug it in on the S terminal

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.049 
and just plug it in on the S terminal
coming<00:01:02.420> out<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.780> your<00:01:03.079> red<00:01:03.320> wire<00:01:04.059> that's

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
coming out and your red wire that's

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.609 
coming out and your red wire that's
coming<00:01:05.509> from<00:01:05.659> your<00:01:05.810> sending<00:01:06.110> unit<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.380> just

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
coming from your sending unit I just

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.969 
coming from your sending unit I just
showed<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:06.920> will<00:01:07.100> go<00:01:07.250> onto<00:01:07.399> s<00:01:07.759> here<00:01:08.390> and

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
showed you will go onto s here and

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.340 
showed you will go onto s here and
that's<00:01:09.979> pretty<00:01:10.250> much<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.200> hooking<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
that's pretty much it for hooking the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.880 
that's pretty much it for hooking the
cinder<00:01:12.890> units<00:01:13.280> up<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:14.630> we'll<00:01:15.409> go<00:01:15.560> on<00:01:15.710> to

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
cinder units up so now we'll go on to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.649 
cinder units up so now we'll go on to
getting<00:01:16.100> power<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> ground

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
getting power to it and then the ground

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.120 
getting power to it and then the ground
and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:18.140> we're<00:01:18.590> almost<00:01:18.770> there<00:01:19.190> alright<00:01:20.180> so

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
and then we're almost there alright so

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.590 
and then we're almost there alright so
another<00:01:22.130> thing<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.640> needed<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.940> tell<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.390> is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
another thing I needed to tell you is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.820 
another thing I needed to tell you is
when<00:01:23.810> I'm<00:01:23.930> sitting<00:01:24.229> there<00:01:24.350> telling<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.680> hook

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
when I'm sitting there telling you hook

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.060 
when I'm sitting there telling you hook
up<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.010> s<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.760> red<00:01:26.030> wire<00:01:26.390> hook<00:01:27.229> into<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.619> S<00:01:27.770> is

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
up to s the red wire hook into the S is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.770 
up to s the red wire hook into the S is
going<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.369> be<00:01:28.460> for<00:01:28.729> your<00:01:28.850> temperature<00:01:29.540> gauge

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
going to be for your temperature gauge

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.310 
going to be for your temperature gauge
and<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:31.130> blue<00:01:31.369> wire<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.420> S<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:33.080> going<00:01:33.260> to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and the blue wire on the S is going to

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.850 
and the blue wire on the S is going to
be<00:01:33.409> for<00:01:33.619> your<00:01:33.710> pressure<00:01:34.460> or<00:01:35.330> your<00:01:35.570> uh<00:01:35.600> yeah<00:01:36.470> oil

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
be for your pressure or your uh yeah oil

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.260 
be for your pressure or your uh yeah oil
pressure<00:01:37.130> gauge<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:37.760> make<00:01:37.909> sure<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.150> don't

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
pressure gauge so make sure you don't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.230 
pressure gauge so make sure you don't
get<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.630> mixed<00:01:38.659> up<00:01:39.430> just<00:01:40.430> remember<00:01:40.729> red<00:01:40.970> is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
get them mixed up just remember red is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.200 
get them mixed up just remember red is
temperature<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.400> red<00:01:43.580> wire<00:01:43.790> will<00:01:44.030> go<00:01:44.060> to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
temperature so the red wire will go to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.300 
temperature so the red wire will go to
the<00:01:44.390> S<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.960> temperature<00:01:45.409> gauge<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.070> blue

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
the S on the temperature gauge the blue

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.420 
the S on the temperature gauge the blue
wire<00:01:46.610> will<00:01:47.600> go<00:01:47.630> on<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.020> s<00:01:48.259> for<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:49.100> pressure

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
wire will go on to s for that pressure

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.320 
wire will go on to s for that pressure
gauge<00:01:50.119> okay<00:01:51.080> now<00:01:51.350> I'll<00:01:51.560> move<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:52.060> okay<00:01:53.060> for

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
gauge okay now I'll move on okay for

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.230 
gauge okay now I'll move on okay for
this<00:01:53.450> step<00:01:53.780> we're<00:01:54.020> going<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:55.030> ground<00:01:56.030> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
this step we're going to ground the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.899 
this step we're going to ground the
gauges<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.439> I<00:01:57.530> said<00:01:57.770> I'm<00:01:58.009> I'm<00:01:58.460> sorry<00:01:58.729> if

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
gauges and like I said I'm I'm sorry if

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.340 
gauges and like I said I'm I'm sorry if
this<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.119> real<00:01:59.330> hard<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.659> see<00:01:59.840> I'm<00:02:00.110> going<00:02:00.290> to

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
this is real hard to see I'm going to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.090 
this is real hard to see I'm going to
just<00:02:00.530> try<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> explain<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.479> uh

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
just try to explain it to you but uh

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.380 
just try to explain it to you but uh
what<00:02:04.100> you're<00:02:04.220> going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.369> do<00:02:04.549> is<00:02:04.759> come<00:02:05.090> off<00:02:05.329> the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
what you're going to do is come off the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.510 
what you're going to do is come off the
ground<00:02:06.170> you're<00:02:06.710> going<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.890> put<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.040> quarter

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
ground you're going to put a quarter

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.839 
ground you're going to put a quarter
inch<00:02:07.850> fitting<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.799> ground<00:02:10.129> from<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.519> top

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
inch fitting on the ground from the top

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.880 
inch fitting on the ground from the top
gauge<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:12.050> what<00:02:12.170> you're<00:02:12.260> going<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.410> do<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.650> use

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
gauge and what you're going to do is use

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.440 
gauge and what you're going to do is use
one<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.160> those<00:02:15.640> piggyback

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
one of those piggyback

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.280 
one of those piggyback
fittings<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.840> put<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.050> all

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
fittings and you can put this all

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.080 
fittings and you can put this all
together<00:02:19.440> before<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.250> put<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.550> in<00:02:20.700> there<00:02:20.880> but

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
together before you put it in there but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.790 
together before you put it in there but
you're<00:02:21.210> going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> come<00:02:21.660> off<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.290> ground

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
you're going to come off of that ground

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.930 
you're going to come off of that ground
into<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.550> piggy<00:02:24.030> back<00:02:24.740> into<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.370> other<00:02:26.580> ground

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
into a piggy back into the other ground

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.870 
into a piggy back into the other ground
I<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.300> know<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.380> right

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
I don't know if you can see it but right

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.470 
I don't know if you can see it but right
right<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.320> there<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:32.340> those<00:02:32.520> two<00:02:32.820> wires<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
right in there see those two wires and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.160 
right in there see those two wires and
what<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.200> did<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.850> did<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.060> piggy<00:02:36.360> back<00:02:36.630> hook<00:02:36.960> them

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
what I did I did a piggy back hook them

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.800 
what I did I did a piggy back hook them
together<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:37.830> came<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.000> with<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
together and I came off of that with the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.430 
together and I came off of that with the
ground<00:02:40.340> longer<00:02:41.340> wire<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.810> ran<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.320> over

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
ground longer wire and I ran it over

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.730 
ground longer wire and I ran it over
here<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> radio<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:47.270> mount<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:49.500> seemed

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
here to the radio a mount and it seemed

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.160 
here to the radio a mount and it seemed
to<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.010> real<00:02:50.280> good<00:02:50.550> ground<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.270> that's<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
to be a real good ground and that's the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.660 
to be a real good ground and that's the
other<00:02:52.380> grounds<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.130> light<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.520> don't

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
other grounds for the light so don't

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.740 
other grounds for the light so don't
worry<00:02:53.760> about<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.360> because<00:02:54.540> you're

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
worry about that now because you're

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.060 
worry about that now because you're
going<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.930> need<00:02:55.080> don't<00:02:55.380> tighten<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:56.010> down

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
going to need don't tighten that down

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.320 
going to need don't tighten that down
yet<00:02:56.490> because<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.820> be<00:02:56.910> putting<00:02:57.150> another

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
yet because going to be putting another

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.900 
yet because going to be putting another
ground<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.960> your<00:02:58.280> for<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.370> lighting<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.760> your

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
ground for your for the lighting of your

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
ground for your for the lighting of your
gauges<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.690> said<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:01.530> come<00:03:01.710> off<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
gauges but like I said just come off the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.540 
gauges but like I said just come off the
ground

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
ground

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.870 
ground
from<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.150> gauge<00:03:03.680> into<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.310> ground<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
from one gauge into the ground of the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
from one gauge into the ground of the
other<00:03:05.910> gauge<00:03:06.300> with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.990> piggyback<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.370> come

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
other gauge with the piggyback and come

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
other gauge with the piggyback and come
off<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> ground<00:03:09.510> from<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.020> down<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
off with the ground from there down to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.180 
off with the ground from there down to
the<00:03:10.980> ground<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:11.750> okay<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.080> then<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.650> for

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
the ground here okay and then now for

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.840 
the ground here okay and then now for
the<00:03:14.310> power<00:03:14.930> okay<00:03:15.930> what<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> use<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.920> believe<00:03:16.950> it

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
the power okay what I use I believe it

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.730 
the power okay what I use I believe it
was<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> radio<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.020> want<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.290> take<00:03:19.590> your

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
was a radio but you want to take your

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.280 
was a radio but you want to take your
test<00:03:20.040> light<00:03:21.110> then<00:03:22.820> test<00:03:23.820> like<00:03:24.750> see<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
test light then test like see that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.990 
test light then test like see that
believe<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> radio<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> came

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
believe this is the radio and I came

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
believe this is the radio and I came
with<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> twin<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:28.260> forgot<00:03:29.130> what's<00:03:29.280> called<00:03:29.520> it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
with a twin I forgot what's called it's

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.210 
with a twin I forgot what's called it's
a<00:03:29.910> twin<00:03:30.270> type<00:03:30.810> fitting<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.470> slides<00:03:31.830> over<00:03:32.070> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
a twin type fitting that slides over to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820 
a twin type fitting that slides over to
positive<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.880> gives<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.260> where<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.560> two

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
positive and gives me where I have two

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.470 
positive and gives me where I have two
connections<00:03:35.400> where<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.520> can<00:03:35.670> run<00:03:35.790> two<00:03:36.030> powers

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
connections where I can run two powers

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.210 
connections where I can run two powers
off<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.470> connection<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.950> what<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> want

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
off of one connection but what you want

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.430 
off of one connection but what you want
to<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.700> put<00:03:41.940> your<00:03:42.060> test<00:03:42.360> light<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.110> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
to do is put your test light on that and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.740 
to do is put your test light on that and
with<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.310> key<00:03:44.520> off<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.030> shouldn't<00:03:45.390> be<00:03:45.480> lit<00:03:45.720> up

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
with the key off it shouldn't be lit up

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.560 
with the key off it shouldn't be lit up
but<00:03:46.350> when<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.590> key<00:03:46.860> comes<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:48.239> should

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
but when the key comes on it should

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.360 
but when the key comes on it should
light<00:03:48.840> up<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> reason<00:03:49.769> that<00:03:49.890> is<00:03:50.130> because

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
light up and the reason that is because

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.840 
light up and the reason that is because
you<00:03:50.459> don't<00:03:50.580> want<00:03:50.820> your<00:03:50.970> gauges<00:03:51.180> lights<00:03:51.930> or

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
you don't want your gauges lights or

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.400 
you don't want your gauges lights or
working<00:03:53.850> why<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.330> keys<00:03:54.570> off<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.050> going<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.290> run

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
working why the keys off is going to run

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.890 
working why the keys off is going to run
your<00:03:55.500> battery<00:03:55.680> down<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.870> double-check<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
your battery down so double-check that

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.050 
your battery down so double-check that
make<00:03:58.350> sure<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.950> only<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.400> power<00:03:59.640> when

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
make sure that you only have power when

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.250 
make sure that you only have power when
the<00:04:00.180> key<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.830> okay<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:01.860> again<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.670> this

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
the key is on okay and again on this

with a piggyback and you can see the

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.709 
with a piggyback and you can see the
piggyback<00:05:14.150> into<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.719> plus<00:05:16.199> side<00:05:16.500> over<00:05:16.830> here

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
piggyback into the plus side over here

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.309 
piggyback into the plus side over here
and<00:05:18.719> then<00:05:18.840> came<00:05:19.139> off<00:05:19.379> with<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.620> hot<00:05:19.830> wire<00:05:20.129> there

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
and then came off with a hot wire there

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.779 
and then came off with a hot wire there
into<00:05:22.319> the<00:05:22.439> power<00:05:22.620> source<00:05:23.039> as<00:05:23.310> well<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:25.789> same

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
into the power source as well and same

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.540 
into the power source as well and same
with<00:05:26.969> the<00:05:27.089> ground<00:05:27.419> I<00:05:27.749> did<00:05:28.439> a<00:05:28.469> ground<00:05:28.979> on<00:05:29.430> the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
with the ground I did a ground on the

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.309 
with the ground I did a ground on the
ground<00:05:29.789> side<00:05:30.089> I<00:05:30.120> came<00:05:30.449> off<00:05:30.629> with<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.960> single

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
ground side I came off with a single

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.939 
ground side I came off with a single
wire<00:05:31.710> off<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.490> ground<00:05:32.729> off<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.150> bottom<00:05:33.569> light

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
up to the ground on the top light and I

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.850 
up to the ground on the top light and I
did<00:05:38.879> a<00:05:38.909> piggyback<00:05:39.270> there<00:05:39.810> and<00:05:40.229> then<00:05:40.469> I<00:05:40.589> came

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
did a piggyback there and then I came

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.189 
did a piggyback there and then I came
off<00:05:41.099> of<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.490> with<00:05:41.759> a<00:05:41.789> longer<00:05:42.150> ground<00:05:42.930> wire

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
off of that with a longer ground wire

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.059 
off of that with a longer ground wire
and<00:05:44.069> I<00:05:44.219> put<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.610> where<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> radio<00:05:45.659> is<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.889> then

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
and I put it where the radio is and then

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.540 
and I put it where the radio is and then
I<00:05:47.159> tighten<00:05:47.399> that<00:05:47.610> bolt<00:05:47.849> down<00:05:48.149> and<00:05:49.550> that's

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550
