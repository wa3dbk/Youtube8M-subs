tell you one presentation that US
walleye<00:00:01.650> guys<00:00:02.159> are<00:00:02.399> starting<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.730> use<00:00:02.909> an

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
walleye guys are starting to use an

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.150 
walleye guys are starting to use an
awful<00:00:03.330> lot<00:00:03.480> as<00:00:03.659> leadcore<00:00:03.929> so<00:00:04.770> let<00:00:04.890> me<00:00:04.980> real

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
awful lot as leadcore so let me real

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.760 
awful lot as leadcore so let me real
quickly<00:00:05.460> go<00:00:05.850> over<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.150> leadcore<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.990> for

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
quickly go over what leadcore is for

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.830 
quickly go over what leadcore is for
those<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.160> who<00:00:08.280> don't<00:00:08.429> know<00:00:08.580> ledcor<00:00:08.910> is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
those of you who don't know ledcor is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.629 
those of you who don't know ledcor is
basically<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.440> line<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:11.040> filled<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.370> lead

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
basically a line that's filled with lead

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.759 
basically a line that's filled with lead
and<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.940> allows<00:00:12.240> us<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.540> get<00:00:12.840> crankbaits

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
and it allows us to get crankbaits

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.620 
and it allows us to get crankbaits
down<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> depths<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:14.880> they<00:00:15.059> normally<00:00:15.420> can't

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
down to depths that they normally can't

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
down to depths that they normally can't
pull<00:00:15.839> themselves<00:00:16.020> for<00:00:16.830> example<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> little

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
pull themselves for example this little

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
pull themselves for example this little
fire<00:00:17.789> stick<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> small<00:00:19.170> bell<00:00:19.439> on

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
fire stick here it's got a small bell on

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
fire stick here it's got a small bell on
it<00:00:19.740> maybe<00:00:19.920> only<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.310> four<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.609> five<00:00:20.670> feet<00:00:21.000> down

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it maybe only go four or five feet down

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.870 
it maybe only go four or five feet down
but<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.020> lead<00:00:22.230> car<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.769> could<00:00:23.160> fish<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.580> even

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
but with lead car I could fish this even

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.839 
but with lead car I could fish this even
down<00:00:24.029> into<00:00:24.240> 30<00:00:24.570> 40<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.019> 50<00:00:25.289> feet<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
to start with a big reel I use a line

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.180 
to start with a big reel I use a line
counting<00:00:32.850> reel<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.960> got<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> big<00:00:34.380> capacity<00:00:35.070> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
counting reel it's got a big capacity in

about twenty feet long and what I use to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.149 
about twenty feet long and what I use to
connect<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.120> lead<00:01:03.660> core<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.830> leader

connect the the lead core to this leader

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.440 
connect the the lead core to this leader
is<00:01:05.519> simply<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> small<00:01:07.130> barrel<00:01:08.130> swivel<00:01:08.450> very

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
is simply a small barrel swivel very

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
English Signature Series rods but in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.859 
English Signature Series rods but in
this<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.850> picked<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> longest<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.750> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
this case I picked the longest one we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
this case I picked the longest one we
have<00:01:34.079> eight<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> half<00:01:34.619> foot<00:01:34.920> mainly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have eight and a half foot mainly

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.850 
have eight and a half foot mainly
because<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> extra<00:01:36.689> length<00:01:36.900> gives<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
because that extra length gives you more
