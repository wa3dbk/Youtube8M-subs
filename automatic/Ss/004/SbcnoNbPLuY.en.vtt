they like the way how it projects off

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.609 
they like the way how it projects off
whitewater<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:09.170> clock<00:01:09.350> kind<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.590> a

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
whitewater and that clock kind of a

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.679 
whitewater and that clock kind of a
ping-pong<00:01:09.920> effect<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:11.390> come<00:01:11.570> up

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
ping-pong effect like you you come up

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.270 
ping-pong effect like you you come up
and<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.840> Bank<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.259> lip<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.680> bounces<00:01:13.130> out

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
and you Bank the lip and it bounces out

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.450 
and you Bank the lip and it bounces out
and<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:13.939> speed<00:01:14.329> and<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:15.200> almost<00:01:15.439> makes<00:01:16.310> you

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
and get speed and it almost makes you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.060 
and get speed and it almost makes you
want<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.759> do<00:01:17.090> little<00:01:17.649> lollipops<00:01:18.649> and<00:01:18.860> stuff

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
one here is what I call a stringer list

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.529 
one here is what I call a stringer list
blank<00:01:28.009> even<00:01:28.399> though<00:01:28.490> these<00:01:28.759> are<00:01:28.939> just<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.270> glue

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
blank even though these are just to glue

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.690 
blank even though these are just to glue
lines<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.079> those<00:01:30.140> are<00:01:30.289> just<00:01:30.439> glue<00:01:30.710> lines<00:01:30.950> for

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
lines and those are just glue lines for

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.219 
lines and those are just glue lines for
decoration<00:01:32.450> but<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.840> doesn't<00:01:33.079> have<00:01:33.200> a

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
decoration but it doesn't have a

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.370 
decoration but it doesn't have a
stringer<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.930> has<00:01:36.079> some<00:01:36.229> wood

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
stringer in it and it just has some wood

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.029 
stringer in it and it just has some wood

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190 
has you know it's it's got a sort
template<00:02:07.609> and<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.050> responsive

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
template and so it's really responsive

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.780 
template and so it's really responsive
and<00:02:10.030> small<00:02:11.030> waves<00:02:11.409> it<00:02:12.409> does<00:02:12.860> not<00:02:13.040> bog<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.640> all

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and small waves it does not bog at all

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.570 
and small waves it does not bog at all
it<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.180> has<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.629> much<00:02:14.780> float<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.290> so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it just has so much float and so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.780 
it just has so much float and so
speed<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:17.260> find<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.100> can

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
speed that you find I think you do can

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.970 
speed that you find I think you do can
have<00:02:18.940> more<00:02:19.210> speed<00:02:19.540> more<00:02:19.570> maneuverability<00:02:20.530> in

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
have more speed more maneuverability in

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.490 
have more speed more maneuverability in
small<00:02:21.760> waves<00:02:22.030> than<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.110> about<00:02:23.260> any<00:02:23.440> other

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
small waves than just about any other

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.630 
small waves than just about any other
short<00:02:23.950> board<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.400> again<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> light

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
short board and again this is a light

lots of belly in different things I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.430 
lots of belly in different things I
shaped<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.540> one<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.960> be<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.230> like<00:02:38.410> a
