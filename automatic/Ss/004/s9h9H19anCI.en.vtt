00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
do is put something just like a bit of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830

but<00:02:14.240> that<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.600> looks<00:02:14.810> nice<00:02:15.020> nonetheless<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
but that still looks nice nonetheless so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.750 
but that still looks nice nonetheless so
give<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.540> try<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:18.319> easier<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.610> more
