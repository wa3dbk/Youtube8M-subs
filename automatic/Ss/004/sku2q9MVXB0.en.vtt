00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
going to see these and now we're going

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
going to see these and now we're going
to<00:00:51.180> hook<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:53.670> ECU<00:00:57.289> once<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.379> get

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to hook them up to the ECU once you get

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
to hook them up to the ECU once you get
the<00:00:58.620> once<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> get<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> harness<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the once you get the harness and the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779 
the once you get the harness and the
pigtail<00:01:01.289> wired<00:01:01.590> through<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:01.949> firewall<00:01:02.190> to

pigtail wired through your firewall to
your<00:01:02.910> ECU<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.659> ECU<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
your ECU you need to go to your ECU and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
your ECU you need to go to your ECU and
look<00:01:08.010> for<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.400> 1<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.930> 5<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:11.340> will<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
look for a 1 and a 5 that will be this

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.780 
look for a 1 and a 5 that will be this
plug<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.330> at<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> big<00:01:12.689> white<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.790> 1

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
plug or here at the big white one a 1

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.130 
plug or here at the big white one a 1
should<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> top<00:01:15.540> left<00:01:16.049> pin<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:17.630> numbered

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
should be the top left pin is numbered

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.180 
should be the top left pin is numbered
right<00:01:20.770> here<00:01:20.980> what<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.370> see<00:01:22.800> so<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:24.010> other

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
right here what you see so the other

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.400 
right here what you see so the other
wire<00:01:24.490> will<00:01:25.060> go<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.510> yellow<00:01:25.690> wire<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
wire will go to the yellow wire on the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.940 
wire will go to the yellow wire on the
harness

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.700 

there's<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> harness<00:01:30.370> or<00:01:30.790> yellow<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
there's the harness or yellow you

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.820 
there's the harness or yellow you
although<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:32.980> other<00:01:33.250> pretty<00:01:33.850> easy<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.740> just

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
although the other pretty easy so just

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.950 
although the other pretty easy so just
but<00:01:36.070> connect<00:01:36.370> that<00:01:36.550> started<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.360> whatever

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
but connect that started it whatever

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.820 
but connect that started it whatever
which<00:01:38.170> way<00:01:38.290> you<00:01:38.350> want<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.560> do<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:41.050> one<00:01:41.440> two

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
which way you want to do so a one two

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.810 
which way you want to do so a one two
yellow<00:01:44.190> now<00:01:45.190> we're<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.490> hook<00:01:45.550> up<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.729> a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
yellow now we're going to hook up to a

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.500 
yellow now we're going to hook up to a
five<00:01:46.150> wire<00:01:47.010> if<00:01:48.010> wire<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.580> five<00:01:48.940> wire<00:01:49.180> should<00:01:49.450> be

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
five wire if wire a five wire should be

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.790 
five wire if wire a five wire should be
red<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.820> there's<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.630> red<00:01:52.780> wire<00:01:52.990> red<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> red

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
red so there's the red wire red the red

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.930 
red so there's the red wire red the red
simple<00:01:54.759> solder<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:55.930> done

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
simple solder it done

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.570 
simple solder it done
now<00:01:57.940> we're<00:01:58.119> done<00:01:58.240> with<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.420> injectors<00:01:59.580> next

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
now we're done with the injectors next

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.320 
now we're done with the injectors next
thing<00:02:00.700> we're<00:02:00.790> gonna<00:02:00.880> do<00:02:00.970> is<00:02:01.000> we're<00:02:01.180> going<00:02:01.270> to

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
thing we're gonna do is we're going to

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.770 
thing we're gonna do is we're going to
hook<00:02:01.420> up<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.600> two<00:02:01.930> disc<00:02:02.140> distributor<00:02:02.890> wires

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
hook up the two disc distributor wires

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
soldered a pin onto the brown wire so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.330 
soldered a pin onto the brown wire so
you<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:26.340> count

one two three four five six seven eight

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.949 
one two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:02:30.519> ten<00:02:31.410> ten<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.769> bottom

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
nine ten ten is the bottom

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.500 
nine ten ten is the bottom
let's<00:02:35.959> go<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.530> slide<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:36.980> there

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
let's go get it slide it in there

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.250 
let's go get it slide it in there
oops<00:02:38.510> wrong<00:02:38.660> way<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.310> took<00:02:40.370> clicks

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
oops wrong way so then I took clicks

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220 
oops wrong way so then I took clicks
okay<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:43.300> okay<00:02:44.300> once<00:02:44.780> you're<00:02:44.930> done<00:02:45.080> with

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
okay it's in okay once you're done with

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.280 
okay it's in okay once you're done with
that<00:02:45.520> you're<00:02:46.520> going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.209> white<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.870> red

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
that you're going to see a white and red

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.490 
that you're going to see a white and red
wire<00:02:48.470> that's<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.340> b12<00:02:50.209> wire<00:02:50.450> you're<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.440> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
wire that's the b12 wire you're going to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.050 
wire that's the b12 wire you're going to
cut<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:53.020> splice<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.550> you're<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:55.970> to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
cut that splice it and you're going to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.059 
cut that splice it and you're going to
hook<00:02:56.270> up<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.770> blue<00:02:58.069> wire<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.680> white<00:03:00.890> and

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
hook up the blue wire to the white and

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.030 
hook up the blue wire to the white and
red<00:03:01.250> wire<00:03:01.930> once<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.050> hook<00:03:03.170> those<00:03:03.380> up<00:03:03.410> solder

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
red wire once you hook those up solder

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.190 
red wire once you hook those up solder
them<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:05.120> now<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.330> installation<00:03:06.110> is

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
them and now the installation is

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.620 
them and now the installation is
complete
