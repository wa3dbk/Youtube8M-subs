 as stanley kubrick and today I bring you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 this team 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.099
 ling ling greeting out there because he has not 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.099
 micro hello 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.410
 and it's good because this concept blind and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.910
 let's see a pretty tutorial 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.040
 interesting and it is a mod 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.230
 hello the link this here that you are 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.230
 watching guys is not the link is a mod 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.440
 and what it does is generate 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.230
 it's too much is great they passed me by 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.180
 twitter the other day and I just try it and 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.430
 They said to record it because it's cool 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.610
 very much as you are seeing is what 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.860
 generates good is called motion capture the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.080
 mod and what it does is capture what 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.790
 is being a character because I am 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.310
 I move and capture my movement and then 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.920
 I can do it good as you can see I can write 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.390
 in the chat etcetera and well very much 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.860
 this I do not know is great because we can 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.720
 do as animations and then 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030
 record it and such if I do not get like that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.680
 he recorded it me that time you record it and such and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 we can do it from characters like you see 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.710
 also launches items but has 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.270
 little buffs have little problems that 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.860
 it happens for example that it can not break 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.440
 blocks is a pretty fat problem 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.210
 but good good, let's put it to zero 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.560
 Come and see, I'm here, it's worth the truth 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.280
 me 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.149
 today to make link to move 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.149
 I'm going better 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.890
 let's kill him there's not too much 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.780
 cool this mold is very cool I leave it 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.040
 in the description auctioneer 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.049
 now leave the description the web page 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.149
 where you see the commands and all that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.680
 explain how it works okay it's so 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.940
 simple as this first there are three 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.500
 commands here there are several but because 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.360
 I have some evidence out there the first 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.710
 command of all is this that is for 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140
 record what I 'm saying my movement 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.250
 the second is this to stop it and the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 third is this from here for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.970
 reproduce it with the skin that we 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.519
 we want a character that has great 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.769
 bought and then the name is worth we go to 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.510
 record a movement for example 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.330
 good has to be with this command 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.709
 then I copy it and I paste it like that and m 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.209
 recording here we can put the name 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.310
 of the recording that we want is to say yes 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.890
 we want to put three four or five or 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 six or ao b12 as you want I put that already 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.250
 foresee three is worth then right now 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.840
 I'm recording not then how are you 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.420
 recording I'm going to do a parkour around here 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 and the only problem is that this mode 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.000
 then you can not place blocks as you go 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.890
 to see now seems to be placing 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 blocks but look I'm going to do this 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.299
 move like this and then when you see it 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.530
 You see, I'm going to see what I'm going to float 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.370
 but good but it's cool to do 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.510
 this for example and um 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.870
 and now what I have to do is this and 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 put this like this and now for recording 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.420
 very well I have here the age me three to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.390
 see which also call for three other 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.010
 good here and he puts recording here this 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.709
 what for example here you have by the name 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.870
 of the recording the name you put and 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.610
 you as a 3 that I recorded with the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.720
 name of three because you can put two and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.290
 make several recordings and put them 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 all at once 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.970
 you can do a lot of things and here 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.079
 you can put the name of the person at 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.049
 character what do you want me to do? 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.079
 I'm going to put rich to see how rich 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.670
 mc and this is the nickname and I'm going to put 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.780
 the Grey 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.680
 the greets 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.170
 mc three hours when they give him then as 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.700
 you see kritz appears there good is the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.959
 script doing things and as you see 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.580
 because it does not put anything is a new problem 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.680
 that has this mode but they are hurt 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.290
 that's pretty cool to check see 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 if it hurts with what is good 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.950
 I have more modes here tucked as you see 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.830
 here placed blocks and does not serve to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.050
 nothing and also if right now I say something 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.720
 by chat for example let's record me 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.870
 is not recording and I put it like this for the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.180
 chat and right now I'll stop this 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.430
 so I stop it and now here I return it 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.560
 to give to start everything as you see 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.420
 look at the chat right now you see 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.920
 now it appears with his name that he 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.390
 write the things that have power 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.820
 throw things from behind 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.800
 efe dwells very much we are guys for 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.320
 do what comes with animations and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.239
 then record is great ball very much 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.220
 and what I want to prove I'm going to 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.130
 record here alone 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.570
 to see and well well I want to check 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.820
 see if a kripper kills me 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.590
 that is if it detects the clip is that I am 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.020
 a normal person or if he detects that I am 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.170
 so a hologram then let's put 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.300
 here now a cri but good we are going to 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.620
 generate scripts here is worth 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.760
 there is kritz 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.760
 and see if it kills him 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.949
 what does not work is because I'm the 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.949
 1.6 voucher worth perfect voucher 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.330
 if it kills him perfect I have appeared here and 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.919
 nothing is great 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.409
 this way is the cane now let's see 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.930
 an example of what we can do and 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.030
 let's put this here so that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.120
 let's say about the epic struggle between 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.169
 clippers and camaro to see who wins 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.789
 So much 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.270
 nothing where it has found with maru is going to me 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.270
 kill m 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.039
 toma has killed me good finish very good 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.669
 very good but for that 6 shooting 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:28.210
 as marc because if this can not be left 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.900
 so I have to win myself first and 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.330
 now the well 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.340
 to see who wins now we go as you see 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.290
 you can record them very cool you put this 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.440
 so that way and you can go ethically 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:46.410
 That's cool, I'm going to die again 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:49.350
 in death again seriously kamoro outs 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.479
 that to make you shrimp they joined Cahuaro 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.550
 but it works with bows with swords I've 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.199
 been testing and it does not work in order 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.360
 now it only remains for you to prove it 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.789
 and the truth is great then I say 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.919
 because it's really cool this way 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.810

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.600
