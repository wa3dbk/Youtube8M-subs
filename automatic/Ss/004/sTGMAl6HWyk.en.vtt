00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.309
 how about people here daguish with a house 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 more for the series of dream houses of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.720
 the sims 3 this is similar to the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 previous family 2 floors 4 rooms 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.710
 2 bathrooms large pool as always me 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 really liked this house from the outside 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.970
 although although olimpia not out there what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.489
 I'm not sure what it looks like but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 well not not bad, I was also 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 he was very funny half an hour trying 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 look for the main door of this house 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 spinning around to see where by 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 where the creator had put him and good 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.820
 I think it would be the one to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.399
 side of the garage more than anything because 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.269
 because it goes directly into the room and not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.420
 well the interior seems like very 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:00.539
 taste of the designer since I am the interior 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.850
 of this house is nothing like the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.710
 of which the others that I raised is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 very very colorful 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 I do not know although it's not bad it has many 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.490
 custom objects that is a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.240
 advantage as I always say because it 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.570
 installed in the game and a novelty is the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.940
 soil that you are seeing is bright in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.560
 some rooms or in almost all the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 house that is placed in a mirror 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.250
 how good I like it only in certain 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.020
 parts of when he built houses or such 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.320
 I have a house of mine, your life in the canal 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.180
 in which I use it what happens is that it makes 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.100
 what the game is doing is slower 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.780
 logically that's why this is also 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.259
 recording I had to do it in mode 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.439
 pause why do not you see the sources 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.509
 working or anything and little else write 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.939
 in the comments what do you think of the house 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.310
 same as in the other videos below 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.899
 you have the usual three links and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.240
 I hope you have seen the chapter of 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.670
 10 chapter 10 the end of season 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.369
 of pre disney live is very good 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.649
 truth to see if I have the following less 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.250
 time and nothing more to take care of everyone 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.250
 goodbye 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.530
