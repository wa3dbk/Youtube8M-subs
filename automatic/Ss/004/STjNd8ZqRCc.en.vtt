00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.850
 so the valve body itself we have two 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:21.869
 flange main body I make from pipe 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.400
 square profile here is such a 50 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:32.250
 50 means we cut off a piece here 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 such cuts and compress them now show 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.410
 how did we get that is already 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.510
 the body is starting to acquire the ones we need 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.519
 the outlines are what we get then 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 there is here now we cut off exactly 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:55.049
 and just we get the thickness of the flange 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.019
 and the same thing here then exactly 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:03.479
 make the plane is the same flange thickness 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.680
 means I grabbed and now now 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.729
 we will cut 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.530
 our posts so this is already ours 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:19.550
 picture drawn means 2 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:22.230
 can be made parallel yes then 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.950
 the valve you will stand strongly up 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.450
 that is, the carburetor will not stand 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 horizontally be a garden up exchange for 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 a motorcycle but usually i try to do 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.380
 all the same valve horizontally then here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.550
 this plane we need to do at an angle 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.540
 just somewhere like that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:49.400
 it turns out like this we got under 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.100
 the angle that is, the planes are not parallel 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.930
 is at some angle from each 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.260
 friend at what angle do not know doing 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.300
 eye 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.940
 honestly admit in the course of the play approximate 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.640
 I have the size as it should 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:08.520
 well that's what we got that is how 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 and talked about turns carburetor 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 will we have to stand in horizontal 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.410
 position so well that's all ours 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:24.770
 blanks are ready left for us only 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.770
 cook and now cook 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120
 root 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.150
 transitions are ready 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.050
 here, in principle, well, there is still of course 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.450
 machining was a typewriter 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.420
 inside all brush to remove steps 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.860
 here on the flange of which the cylinder 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:56.980
 will fit and still need to be 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:04:00.580
 absolute money plane 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.050
 butt man must be necessary 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:09.130
 because all the same flanges after welding 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.730
 leads ie they are deformed as if 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:17.769
 It turns out a little bend and 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:22.000
 not even a little bit ok that's them 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:26.950
 on this mark the king is here and chop another 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:33.340
 thread 4 holes we have m6 under the cover in 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:38.350
 end paint it like that now after 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.200
 body welding need to remove all 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.590
 irregularities that is wherever a couple 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.600
 made all clean flange here 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.720
 which is attached directly 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.840
 cylinder it naturally we don’t 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.930
 matched a little were steps now 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.419
 I took a drill here and took off 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.080
 still left in the corners now another more 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:05.970
 shallow cutter will need to trim 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.130
 you need to see can not see here it is removed and 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.680
 it is clear that he was with us even I 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.680
 made the corners so they repeated as if 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.860
 body bend 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.599
 that is a lot of work besides with fit 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.550
 Welding I am looking for a refinement with windows here 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.430
 here too I saw made these cuts 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.370
 made to us later 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.680
 convenient to tighten these hexagons 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.270
 that is, if this cut is not done then 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.840
 then overall no tool 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.150
 slip 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.949
 and chat do not tighten so here yet 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.009
 very important manufacturing operation 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:53.219
 the body of the flap valve is 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:57.900
 crimping crimping is done 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:06:00.120
 just that is, two gum pieces of iron and here 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.300
 such a bicycle nipple in order 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:08.729
 so that you can pump air for 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.460
 what is this done any air leaks in 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.250
 valve body 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.639
 leads to a lean mixture any micro 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.379
 hole two or three on the copper all motor 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.930
 normally will not work ie 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.610
 necessarily pressure testing and 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.210
 must be one hundred percent tight 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.080
 that is, I shake my boredom in the compressor 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.020
 24 pounds until all of these clamps 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.569
 instructions stand i shake bubbles 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.569
 there is no even the smallest mean 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:44.219
 u can normally bring up bears 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:47.150
 to paint and sets everything back 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.150
 let's go add 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.290
 the first building showed us 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.800
 one hundred percent tightness and here is the second 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:23.210
 with a hole but after looking I saw 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:27.880
 that we have a hole because we simply don’t 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:30.350
 spoke seam here it is a small piece 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:36.590
 we are talking now and everything will be 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:46.580
 blow up so here it is all fallen in sight 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:49.030
 trace we go check all two corps i 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.030
 made 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.090
 let it be decent enough 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.040
 amount of time all 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.040
 I naturally did not shoot and 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.150
 I think it makes no sense to show it all
