00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.379
 it means we have with you today as their 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.640
 everyone calls bedouin hats hats i 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.720
 I do not know why 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.550
 Bedouin because I once upon a time I 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.460
 was once in Israel and me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.640
 naturally dragged into the desert why am i 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 in Israel was no matter how tourist 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 the trip was with friends from friends and we 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950
 went to the desert we were there 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.629
 some 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 minivan with air conditioning and everything was 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 wonderful there i was but no short 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.739
 quality is impossible in shorts but something like this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.690
 very lightly dressed when I came out of this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.719
 cars and we went somewhere 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.050
 I began to shoot myself means that's all 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 to make it go insanely hot and we 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.470
 somewhere we walked we walked and we came for a visit 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.299
 k means one family of nomads and when 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 I understand that I am simply indecent 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.729
 stripped i noticed that they 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:19.770
 wrapped up and as if on the street is not a plus 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.450
 40x minus 40 and that's when all this 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.090
 it was very interesting it was all very 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.640
 informative it was all perfect 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.159
 unexpectedly but it was a long time ago I had it all 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.070
 here I ate soaked and she apparently 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 somewhere there in the dressing left I'm talking about 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.670
 it has safely forgotten this summer 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.259
 when I was making a collection of gardens of semiramis 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.450
 suddenly I have the last hat in this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.229
 the collection got out here and here 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.060
 she got out at my associations 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.430
 atolls 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:59.509
 usually associations association with oceans 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.149
 with reefs in general what is sea if 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.070
 nautical theme means hot and if hot 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.039
 I mean I assume these here 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.289
 Bedouins from the subconscious jumped out 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.090
 and when I first do it later 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.860
 I understand my brain is so 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.739
 somewhat strange way 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.500
 and when I saw this result I 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.660
 I realized that you can play this 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.080
 can be used because 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.360
 I spent some winters but in classes 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.870
 that's it here I came in it today 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.580
 or before that in such hats 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.350
 bilayer fields when this here 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.970
 a little lower and better 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.849
 close while feeling 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.700
 completely comfortable and after i 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.510
 already done came up with these here with 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.000
 cap ears with their natural pro 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.700
 experimented and when I this year 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.880
 in late november december was on 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.570
 Ural I was shod in this hat and in Omsk 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 I hit just the temperature of -28 nts 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.670
 the wind and here as you understand this 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.519
 everything is completely transparent to me 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.150
 my girls say harry novice 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:11.150
 yurchiku over scientist drying 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.970
 know how warm i am go i am every time 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.970
 I'm surprised at how much 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.530
 divine work 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 human thought 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.080
 so here it is I mean what it means all the same 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.970
 all the same Bedouin pushed me to it 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.209
 when this bedouin collection appeared 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.159
 as the first collection she became 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.879
 called not just bedouin trekking on 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.239
 north as if dressed Bedouins hitting 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.709
 cold climate ie the same principle 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.110
 obfuscation for mats which 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.720
 allows to keep heat as much as possible 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.459
 Bedouin collection I made it right there 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.049
 all bought up about that collection left 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.629
 only this one 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.390
 it fits me sim highlighting those 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:01.310
 clean set and just over the mint 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.129
 bush and when i was doing on December 23rd i 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.079
 made a presentation on creative meetings 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.870
 collections of pita and on in the collection as 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:13.090
 This was not the case I managed to do this 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.680
 terracotta showed her gray and everything and 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.630
 natural hysterically here to 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.209
 today all new year I 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.650
 hysterically made these Bedouin here all 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.889
 what could i do 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.479
 I did it on the way I got it 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.760
 so many new thoughts one more 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:33.380
 technology was born but it will be next 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:36.320
 and here are 2 hats of them here and here 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.810
 this is already based on the defile 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.910
 which I have to swim on the formula that is 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.820
 see how they are different yes I have like 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.720
 always a little casual wear 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.870
 casual 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.860
 these are hats that you can wear 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.169
 minibus in the subway with a jacket with a fur coat without 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.450
 make-up so that it is comfortable and without 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.460
 claims so here's what i'm doing with 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.440
 claims it is for catwalk because 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.200
 Of course this is the case and will not be sold 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.750
 all these mustaches here and 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.060
 I do not know . what do you call grass moore you 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.890
 They will be cleaned and all the lace is 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.720
 there is a variant of this podium so here 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.590
 about 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.590
 Bedouin specifically 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.020
 I have been distracted again for a long time 124 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.630
 lyrical digression 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:37.730
 I have long cherished the idea that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:42.050
 make a course on caps in ascending order 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.280
 from the simplest to the most difficult but 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.630
 I could not do it 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.270
 and the first movie we recorded is 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.160
 was the technology of single-layer fields well 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.010
 because she is basic but she doesn't care 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.950
 complicated and there are things to do 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:02.480
 much easier and if you start off easy 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.130
 then everything is difficult, this is what after 2 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.760
 hours of information eyes start 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.950
 fall out of the mask skip 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.800
 Now if you start with a simple it and 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.240
 all will be perceived further 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:19.190
 natural and comfortable so today 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.580
 consider that we are lucky we start with 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.580
 simple
