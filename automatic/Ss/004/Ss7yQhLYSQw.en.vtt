00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
I don't really train it I know I could
it's<00:01:42.600> easy<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> level<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.220> two

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's easy to get to that level in two

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.569 
it's easy to get to that level in two
weeks<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.049> nevertheless<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.530> can't<00:01:47.250> buy<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
way alternate way to get it maybe the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.590 
way alternate way to get it maybe the
nightfall<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:52.920> maybe<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> weekly<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.210> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
nightfall or maybe the weekly or just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.800 
nightfall or maybe the weekly or just
something<00:01:54.979> maybe<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.600> ice

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
now i don't really need it because i

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.810 
now i don't really need it because i
can't<00:02:03.630> even<00:02:03.810> wear<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.729> really

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
can't even wear it but I just really

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.490 
can't even wear it but I just really
want<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> gun<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:06.750> hopefully<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
soon if I don't get any other alternate

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
soon if I don't get any other alternate
way<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.289> guess<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> wait<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> ice

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
way I guess I have to wait for the ice

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
way I guess I have to wait for the ice
breaker<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.599> who<00:02:12.840> knows

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
breaker but who knows

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.110 
breaker but who knows
long<00:02:13.590> they'll<00:02:13.830> wait<00:02:14.040> until<00:02:14.280> they<00:02:14.700> release<00:02:14.880> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
long they'll wait until they release it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.050 
long they'll wait until they release it
again<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:16.530> gonna<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> long<00:02:17.070> time<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.580> good

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
again it's gonna be a long time so good

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.690
