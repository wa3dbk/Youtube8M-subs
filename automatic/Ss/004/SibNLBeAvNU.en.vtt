00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
some extensive testing what I found is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640 
some extensive testing what I found is
that<00:00:15.210> those<00:00:15.450> things<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.839> don't<00:00:16.199> convert

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
that those things just don't convert

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.740 
that those things just don't convert
very<00:00:16.920> well<00:00:17.130> you'll<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.550> very<00:00:17.970> few<00:00:18.390> amount<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
very well you'll get very few amount of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620 
very well you'll get very few amount of
opt-ins<00:00:19.460> really<00:00:20.460> no<00:00:20.580> matter<00:00:20.699> what<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
what I found that converts even better

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
what I found that converts even better
than<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.019> actually<00:00:25.529> putting<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.890> banner

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
