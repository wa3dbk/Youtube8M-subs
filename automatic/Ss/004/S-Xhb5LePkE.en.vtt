little<00:01:40.130> bit<00:01:40.340> dumb<00:01:40.520> because<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.570> apps<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:41.990> it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
little bit dumb because the apps that it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.750 
little bit dumb because the apps that it
doesn't<00:01:42.440> change<00:01:42.650> just<00:01:42.980> doesn't<00:01:43.280> fit<00:01:43.490> at<00:01:43.520> all

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
doesn't change just doesn't fit at all

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.950 
doesn't change just doesn't fit at all
but<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.660> has<00:01:44.840> like<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.320> ton<00:01:45.890> of<00:01:45.920> apps<00:01:46.250> um<00:01:46.870> ton<00:01:47.870> of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
but it has like a ton of apps um ton of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.260 
but it has like a ton of apps um ton of
icons<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> changes<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.730> I'm<00:01:49.790> okay<00:01:50.090> with

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
icons that it changes so I'm okay with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.120

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
has an app icon mask which basically

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.800 
has an app icon mask which basically
means<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.090> doesn't<00:02:10.330> have<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.660> an

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
means that if it doesn't have like an

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.320 
means that if it doesn't have like an
actual<00:02:11.350> icon<00:02:11.800> created<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.700> changes<00:02:13.090> it

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
actual icon created that it changes it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.560 
actual icon created that it changes it
adds<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:13.900> mask<00:02:14.230> over<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.740> app<00:02:15.550> icon<00:02:16.360> to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
adds this mask over the app icon to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.030 
adds this mask over the app icon to
where<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.780> just<00:02:17.050> basically<00:02:17.230> looks<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
where it just basically looks in the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.250 
where it just basically looks in the
same<00:02:18.280> style<00:02:18.760> theme<00:02:19.120> as<00:02:19.360> all<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> other<00:02:19.810> icons

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
same style theme as all the other icons

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.070 
same style theme as all the other icons
so<00:02:21.010> basically<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.670> virtually<00:02:21.880> changes<00:02:22.540> every

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
so basically it virtually changes every

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.050 
so basically it virtually changes every
icon<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.160> download<00:02:24.430> from<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> App<00:02:25.030> Store

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
of see-through and as I said if there's

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.129 
of see-through and as I said if there's
an<00:04:21.880> icon<00:04:22.120> unchanged<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.750> know<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.990> doesn't

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
an icon unchanged you know it doesn't

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.110 
an icon unchanged you know it doesn't
really<00:04:23.320> look<00:04:23.560> good<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:24.009> every<00:04:24.490> icon<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.850> had

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
really look good but every icon I had

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.499 
really look good but every icon I had
downloaded<00:04:26.400> was<00:04:27.400> changed<00:04:27.850> except<00:04:28.180> that<00:04:28.330> one

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
downloaded was changed except that one

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.150 
downloaded was changed except that one
in<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> upper<00:04:28.990> left<00:04:29.199> corner<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.800> that's<00:04:30.009> a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
in the upper left corner and that's a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.909 
in the upper left corner and that's a
really<00:04:30.970> new<00:04:31.270> app<00:04:31.509> so<00:04:32.320> that's<00:04:32.500> probably<00:04:32.710> why

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
really new app so that's probably why

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.710 
really new app so that's probably why
it's<00:04:33.160> unchanged<00:04:33.759> and<00:04:33.850> plus<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.389> create<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
it's unchanged and plus you can create a

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.499 
it's unchanged and plus you can create a
template<00:04:35.139> now<00:04:35.889> this<00:04:36.190> also<00:04:36.370> has<00:04:36.669> like<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> custom

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
template now this also has like a custom

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.110 
template now this also has like a custom
menu<00:04:38.500> thing<00:04:38.860> those<00:04:39.039> pop-up<00:04:39.490> things<00:04:39.699> like<00:04:39.970> that

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
menu thing those pop-up things like that

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.960

as<00:04:40.330> you<00:04:40.449> saw<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:42.190> pretty<00:04:42.370> much<00:04:42.490> sums<00:04:42.820> up

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
as you saw and that pretty much sums up

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.420 
as you saw and that pretty much sums up
this<00:04:43.120> theme
