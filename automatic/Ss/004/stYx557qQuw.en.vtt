00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all a doubt I my home 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.499
 stickers and one to turn today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.969
 for a new video 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:11.639
 so these videos will consist of you 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.769
 explain how to open your ports for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.240
 replay with some kraft 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.630
 find senators and shepherds his 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.800
 computer safely 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.300
 so before I start I want to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 apologize for the excuse for the lack 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.689
 water that underwater kiev presently 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.750
 so I'm not going to motivation for the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.090
 woman and I think I'll get you out 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 a few in the next few days 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.640
 the next few days so let's start 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.750
 now we will start by going 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.140
 look for our ip address of 1300 times 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.220
 forts sent into swamps talking 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.540
 population is required or internet 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.040
 it's a trio sharing and the number of 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.820
 connections 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.170
 so we react on details so I want 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.570
 to send to the French that this manipulation 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.229
 works on bell fibe for others 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.950
 bl services so i do not know to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.969
 you to test days so the addresses 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.219
 ip as this one is this one so we 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:26.009
 sees them note over a period so 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.299
 community immediately we wanted 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.689
 miss because we 're going to need 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.689
 later 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:37.829
 so as we also say 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.979
 this one notes in so much time I 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.359
 as appreciated as it is that this video 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.590
 was done with the help of the video 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.909
 exotic misters 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.020
 but through his chain in the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 description of the video by clicking them 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.799
 little closed opportunities after we will go 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.799
 on the Internet 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.439
 we will go get our guts and the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.760
 second and then when we copied 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:17.010
 that is ip ip4 the ipv4 would think 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.500
 would think it by default and b4 you're going 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.040
 so we're going to glue here where she who on 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.860
 twitter 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.280
 they will ask us for a 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 authentication 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.519
 so if you ever said been the name 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 be renmin and the brushes namely 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.360
 still be who's going out to connect we're going 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.129
 go on games and apps 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.519
 we will select them all sending the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.069
 listing 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:49.650
 buy a toy or app here on 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.239
 will take peccolo note here so 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.079
 you can click on mouse but me 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.640
 I said I'm going for nothing 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.670
 I will cancel and we will go 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.069
 of a wireless network in this gold coin 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.420
 so also here local network of friends who 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:12.120
 smile and direction of port 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:14.390
 we will finally create a new rule on 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.109
 will call it for example minecraft 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.609
 we will go here our tcp pork is not 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.500
 source and port of minecraft by 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:29.849
 defect ie 2 5 6 and 5 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:32.159
 the pc bed here and the pronunciation 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.590
 I left myself 2 505 because that's 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.659
 very advantageous for your knowledge because 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.209
 the players who go who will want to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 connect on it will not have to enter 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.329
 ip manual so appreciated somehow 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.870
 saved so I'm told I'm doing so 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.790
 it does not work 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.200
 subsequently, because you are going to recreate 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.150
 this rule and you go you go 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.090
 do exactly the same thing with the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.769
 udp rule so after you go replicate 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.799
 on mice so what were I the facts 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:04.139
 so it does not work then because you have 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:06.659
 all done that you can shut up yourself 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:14.669
 will go to know the records 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:18.030
 your knowledge and in its recovery here you 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:21.799
 go find out find out ip you 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.799
 go in your ip taser 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.940
 7 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.639
 then if it's back to school here and you 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.919
 go get them 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:37.580
 can the knowledge know so here so if 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.990
 you have a sort the leap gold the pot that 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.080
 you have marked as redirection of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.690
 ports grab the input you have 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.040
 changed sex and xing so we 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.979
 had left 2.5 5.5 so sicav aic 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.320
 after her we will save 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:59.510
 and if all we finish directional re 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.800
 Supreme which intersect at the port after 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.289
 you will take to this mode to know the 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.780
 people will be able to log on 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.949
 so I remind you to subscribe 1 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.289
 it would be cool if you put some but 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.680
 Video didn's time if you 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:17.379
 did not like 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.110
 to go see my facebook or twitter 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:24.500
 to keep you informed about the media 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.690
 video and I apologize again must not 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:32.710
