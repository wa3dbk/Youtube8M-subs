matched or we'll have a good battle and
I<00:00:34.710> will<00:00:34.920> try<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.850> around<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.360> those

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I will try to get around to doing those

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.299 
I will try to get around to doing those
one<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> next<00:00:37.079> time<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> Audi

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
one the next time so we are in the Audi

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
one the next time so we are in the Audi
r8<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> come<00:00:40.079> flying<00:00:40.379> into<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
r8 first and we come flying into the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.150 
r8 first and we come flying into the
first<00:00:40.829> corner<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.230> it<00:00:43.230> looks<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.710> settled

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
first corner and it looks very settled

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
first corner and it looks very settled
on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> brakes<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> dust<00:00:45.360> coming<00:00:45.539> up

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
on the brakes a bit of dust coming up

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
on the brakes a bit of dust coming up
but<00:00:46.410> otherwise<00:00:46.950> looks<00:00:47.340> pretty<00:00:47.670> controlled

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
but otherwise looks pretty controlled

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.690 
but otherwise looks pretty controlled
around<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> inside<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:50.190> hooked<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
around the inside there but hooked up to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.090 
around the inside there but hooked up to
the<00:00:50.789> apex<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.360> nicely<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.770> come<00:00:52.920> into

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the apex very nicely and as we come into

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
the apex very nicely and as we come into
Chicago<00:00:55.250> again<00:00:56.250> looks<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.600> controlled

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
Chicago again looks very very controlled

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.139 
Chicago again looks very very controlled
and<00:00:58.140> composed<00:00:58.559> through<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.969> keep

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and composed through there we keep

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.330 
and composed through there we keep
within<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> cones<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.050> exit<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
within the cones on the exit so that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450 
within the cones on the exit so that
shows<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> car<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:04.460> good

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
shows that the car is very very good

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.190 
shows that the car is very very good
handling<00:01:05.850> wise<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.540> come<00:01:06.689> flying<00:01:06.930> into

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
handling wise and we come flying into

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
handling wise and we come flying into
the<00:01:07.290> Hammerhead<00:01:08.000> get<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> brakes<00:01:09.360> fairly

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the Hammerhead get on the brakes fairly

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.330 
the Hammerhead get on the brakes fairly
early<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.260> there's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> cones

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
early because there's a lot of cones

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.510 
early because there's a lot of cones
here<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> avoid<00:01:12.590> hooked<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> apex<00:01:14.130> nicely

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here to avoid hooked up the apex nicely

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
here to avoid hooked up the apex nicely
within<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.270> white<00:01:15.450> lines<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> see

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
within the white lines so you can see

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.429 
within the white lines so you can see
there<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.740> the

there that the

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.620 
there that the
the<00:01:17.799> handling<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.310> very<00:01:18.340> very<00:01:19.119> good<00:01:19.299> on<00:01:19.479> this

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the handling is very very good on this

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.020 
the handling is very very good on this
car<00:01:19.860> first<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.950> power<00:01:21.100> on<00:01:21.280> quite<00:01:21.460> nicely<00:01:21.670> onto

the<00:01:51.550> Nissan<00:01:51.850> GTR<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:52.600> are<00:01:52.750> going<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.960> do

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the Nissan GTR that we are going to do

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.640 
the Nissan GTR that we are going to do
this<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:54.789> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
this in the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.530 
this in the
Chace<00:01:57.340> camp

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
Chace camp

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.510 
Chace camp
a<00:01:58.650> bitch

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
a bitch

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.429 
a bitch
so<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.479> can<00:02:01.600> see<00:02:01.720> what<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:02.020> actually<00:02:02.170> looks

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
so you can see what it actually looks

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.340 
so you can see what it actually looks
like<00:02:02.680> from<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.880> drivers<00:02:04.540> point<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.930> view<00:02:05.049> or

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
like from the drivers point of view or

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.800 
like from the drivers point of view or
from<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.950> on<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.729> car<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:07.659> they

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
from the on the car so you can see they

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.330 
from the on the car so you can see they
get<00:02:07.960> hooked<00:02:08.319> up<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.679> they<00:02:08.860> things<00:02:09.130> very

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
get hooked up with it they things very

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.699 
get hooked up with it they things very
nicely<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.789> exit<00:02:10.090> bit<00:02:10.330> wide<00:02:10.599> there<00:02:10.959> but

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
nicely on the exit bit wide there but

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.550 
nicely on the exit bit wide there but
doesn't<00:02:11.860> slow<00:02:12.160> down<00:02:12.190> too<00:02:12.459> much<00:02:13.230> very<00:02:14.230> wide

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
doesn't slow down too much very wide

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
entry here I'm going to cut back here

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.110 
entry here I'm going to cut back here
for<00:02:16.959> array<00:02:17.140> their<00:02:17.349> apex<00:02:17.709> which<00:02:18.400> gives<00:02:18.700> us<00:02:18.880> some

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
for array their apex which gives us some

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.449 
for array their apex which gives us some
good<00:02:19.269> power<00:02:19.510> on<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.080> straightener<00:02:20.590> within

good power on to the straightener within

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.400 
good power on to the straightener within
the<00:02:21.580> code<00:02:21.790> once<00:02:22.120> again<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:23.170> there

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
the code once again so you see there

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.199 
the code once again so you see there
that<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.769> was<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> very<00:02:24.040> good<00:02:24.130> corner<00:02:24.580> now

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
that that was a very good corner now

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.520 
that that was a very good corner now
Chicago<00:02:25.420> now<00:02:25.959> would<00:02:26.110> come<00:02:26.230> into<00:02:26.380> the

Hammerhead on the brakes very early but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.830 
Hammerhead on the brakes very early but
it<00:02:29.380> was<00:02:29.470> very<00:02:29.650> tight<00:02:29.890> on<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.099> entry<00:02:30.400> here<00:02:30.840> get

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
it was very tight on the entry here get

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.600 
it was very tight on the entry here get
turned<00:02:32.319> into<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.769> right-hand<00:02:33.040> side<00:02:33.250> within

the<00:02:33.700> white<00:02:33.850> lines<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.750> as<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.110> did<00:02:35.200> an<00:02:35.350> Audi

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
the white lines just as we did an Audi

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.820 
the white lines just as we did an Audi
r8<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:37.299> car<00:02:37.480> has<00:02:37.630> very<00:02:37.810> good<00:02:38.019> traction<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so no sliding like that was in the

so no sliding like that was in the
McLaren<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.560> previous<00:02:43.950> video<00:02:44.220> happened

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
McLaren in the previous video happened

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.410 
McLaren in the previous video happened
to<00:02:45.240> break<00:02:45.450> down<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.910> follow-through<00:02:47.940> part

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
to break down to the follow-through part

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.970 
to break down to the follow-through part
one<00:02:48.950> full<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:50.040> route<00:02:50.190> 43<00:02:50.760> part<00:02:51.150> 2<00:02:51.420> here<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.890> have

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
one full of route 43 part 2 here we have

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
a lift over comfort lift there but it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.950 
a lift over comfort lift there but it
could<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.320> got<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.650> quicker<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.960> looked

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
could have got a bit quicker but looked

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.200 
could have got a bit quicker but looked
okay<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.470> me<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.550> come<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.910> second

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
corner a bit wide but that is so hard to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.910 
corner a bit wide but that is so hard to
get<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.660> final<00:03:03.990> corner<00:03:04.170> Gambon<00:03:04.440> a

the Nissan GTR first let's type in
Nissan<00:03:38.040> GTR<00:03:39.680> Wow<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.710> need<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.070> learn<00:03:41.190> how<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
Nissan GTR Wow I need to learn how to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.949 
Nissan GTR Wow I need to learn how to
type<00:03:41.660> did<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:43.910> 118<00:03:47.060> point<00:03:48.060> zero<00:03:48.360> which<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
type did it in 118 point zero which is

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.140 
type did it in 118 point zero which is
the<00:03:49.080> same<00:03:49.260> as<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> four<00:03:49.620> five<00:03:49.800> eight<00:03:50.150> perhaps

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the same as the four five eight perhaps

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.640 
the same as the four five eight perhaps
surprisingly<00:03:51.959> because<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.380> would<00:03:52.590> have

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
surprisingly because I would have

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.650 
surprisingly because I would have
thought<00:03:52.709> it'd<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.010> slower<00:03:53.550> if<00:03:53.880> anything<00:03:54.450> but

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
thought it'd be slower if anything but

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.050 
thought it'd be slower if anything but
actually<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.350> know<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.490> hard<00:03:56.940> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
actually I don't know it's it's hard to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.530 
actually I don't know it's it's hard to
tell<00:03:57.209> exactly<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:58.080> has<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> lower<00:03:58.470> pi<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.070> then

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
tell exactly it has a lower pi but then

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.080 
tell exactly it has a lower pi but then
it<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> beast<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.380> car<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.670> Audi<00:04:02.820> r8

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
it is a beast of a car and the Audi r8

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.840 
it is a beast of a car and the Audi r8
did<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.920> howdy<00:04:04.920> ra<00:04:05.570> is<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.840> faster<00:04:07.670> yes<00:04:08.670> is

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
did it in howdy ra is it faster yes is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.510 
did it in howdy ra is it faster yes is
it<00:04:09.090> did<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.330> one<00:04:09.540> seventeen<00:04:10.290> point<00:04:10.890> nine<00:04:10.980> and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
it did in one seventeen point nine and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.430 
it did in one seventeen point nine and
how<00:04:11.820> close<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.330> that<00:04:12.840> was<00:04:12.959> another<00:04:13.200> very

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
how close is that that was another very

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.380 
how close is that that was another very
good<00:04:13.650> battle<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.850> last<00:04:15.000> battle<00:04:15.330> was

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
good battle so the last battle was

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.860 
good battle so the last battle was
separated<00:04:16.320> by<00:04:16.440> 0.2<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.520> second<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.660> one

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
separated by 0.2 of a second this one

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.090 
separated by 0.2 of a second this one
separated<00:04:19.500> by<00:04:19.739> 1/10<00:04:20.730> of<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:21.030> second<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.560> those

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
separated by 1/10 of a second so those

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.280 
separated by 1/10 of a second so those
are<00:04:23.280> two<00:04:23.640> very<00:04:23.669> good<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.419> battles<00:04:24.840> actually

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
are two very good and battles actually

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.890 
are two very good and battles actually
and<00:04:25.470> hopefully<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.430> next<00:04:26.520> ones<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:27.510> be<00:04:27.660> as

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and hopefully the next ones will be as

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.350 
and hopefully the next ones will be as
close<00:04:28.200> as<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.700> so<00:04:29.700> if<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:29.970> enjoyed<00:04:30.270> the
