and transform this baby we're going to
do<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.960> take<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.170> whole<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.680> down<00:01:41.659> rotate

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
do is take this whole thing down rotate

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
do is take this whole thing down rotate
and<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.070> piece<00:01:44.340> whatnot<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.869> saw

paddle to the side so was that one and
basically<00:02:10.770> i<00:02:11.069> got<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> tree<00:02:11.580> stand<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.060> up

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
basically i got a tree stand them up

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.300 
basically i got a tree stand them up
because<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.129> be

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
going all the way through the back all

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.180 
going all the way through the back all
right<00:02:18.209> other<00:02:18.569> panels<00:02:19.020> are<00:02:19.140> released<00:02:19.380> justjust

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.760 
is supposed to be more of his body but
I'm<00:06:43.100> thinking<00:06:43.790> but<00:06:44.330> yeah<00:06:44.660> it<00:06:44.930> just<00:06:44.960> looks<00:06:45.620> out

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
I'm thinking but yeah it just looks out

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.640 
I'm thinking but yeah it just looks out
of<00:06:45.800> place<00:06:45.920> so<00:06:46.250> he'll<00:06:46.430> get<00:06:46.550> a<00:06:46.580> 4<00:06:46.990> out<00:06:47.990> of<00:06:48.050> 5<00:06:48.440> s

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
of place so he'll get a 4 out of 5 s

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.750 
of place so he'll get a 4 out of 5 s
overall<00:06:48.980> he<00:06:49.280> gets<00:06:49.490> a<00:06:49.720> 4.5<00:06:50.720> out<00:06:51.080> of<00:06:51.110> 5<00:06:51.560> I<00:06:52.100> say
