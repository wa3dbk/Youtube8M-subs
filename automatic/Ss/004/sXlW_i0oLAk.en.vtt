00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
discovered it was a little bit too

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.750 
discovered it was a little bit too
narrow<00:00:22.650> for<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:23.010> purposes<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:25.160> anyway<00:00:26.160> what

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
narrow for my purposes but anyway what

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.019 
narrow for my purposes but anyway what
I've<00:00:26.880> got<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.429> emitter<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.730> from

she<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.210> barely<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.660> perhaps<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
she can just barely see perhaps is the

the<00:00:50.370> problem<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:52.070> my<00:00:53.070> sink<00:00:53.640> tube<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the problem was that my sink tube was a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.490 
the problem was that my sink tube was a
little<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.199> too<00:00:55.350> narrow<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> MHS<00:00:58.260> part

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little bit too narrow for the MHS part

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.360 
little bit too narrow for the MHS part
so<00:00:58.620> i<00:00:58.710> had<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.690> slit<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so i had to make a slit here as you can

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
of this blade is this copper he's here

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020 
of this blade is this copper he's here
this<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.200> actually<00:03:14.320> just<00:03:14.620> adhesive<00:03:15.580> copper

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
this is actually just adhesive copper

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.940 
this is actually just adhesive copper
sheeting<00:03:16.390> very<00:03:16.600> thin<00:03:16.840> piece<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.530> copper

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950

what<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.200> did<00:03:23.440> was<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.709> took<00:03:23.739> another<00:03:24.040> chunk<00:03:24.700> of

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
what I did was I took another chunk of

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.800 
what I did was I took another chunk of
this<00:03:25.000> blade<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:27.239> cut<00:03:28.239> out<00:03:28.269> us<00:03:29.010> could<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
this blade and I cut out us could I a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.880 
this blade and I cut out us could I a
slit<00:03:31.810> in<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:32.049> long<00:03:32.260> enough<00:03:32.380> that<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.830> could

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
slit in it long enough that I could

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.910 
slit in it long enough that I could
squeeze<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.970> inside<00:03:34.420> his<00:03:34.660> tube<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.680> top<00:03:35.860> of

squeeze it inside his tube and on top of

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.830 
squeeze it inside his tube and on top of
that<00:03:36.100> inner<00:03:36.700> tube<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:38.500> simply<00:03:39.690> stuck<00:03:40.690> on

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
that inner tube I just simply stuck on

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.460 
that inner tube I just simply stuck on
this<00:03:41.019> sheet<00:03:41.500> of<00:03:41.850> copper<00:03:42.850> sheeting<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:43.390> if<00:03:44.350> I

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
this sheet of copper sheeting and if I

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.289 
this sheet of copper sheeting and if I
had<00:03:44.620> left<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:45.010> as<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.519> was<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.820> would<00:03:45.940> be<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> mess

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
had left it as it was it would be a mess

had left it as it was it would be a mess
right<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:46.540> but<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.900> covered<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:47.790> sealant

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
right now but I covered it with sealant

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.780 
right now but I covered it with sealant
to<00:03:49.390> protect<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:50.530> copper<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:51.610> nice<00:03:51.760> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
to protect the copper so it's nice and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.250 
to protect the copper so it's nice and

batteries what is ni-mh type
rechargeable<00:04:23.020> batteries<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.820> these<00:04:24.820> don't

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
rechargeable batteries and these don't

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.790 
rechargeable batteries and these don't
have<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.180> be<00:04:25.270> removed<00:04:25.630> because<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.230> have<00:04:26.680> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
have to be removed because I have the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.830 
have to be removed because I have the
recharge<00:04:27.160> port<00:04:27.460> here<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:27.820> fact<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.540> would<00:04:28.690> be

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
recharge port here in fact it would be

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600 
recharge port here in fact it would be
very<00:04:28.960> difficult<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.470> remove<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.370> can<00:04:30.460> see

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
very difficult to remove so you can see

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
very difficult to remove so you can see
it<00:04:30.670> doesn't<00:04:30.910> have<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.030> proper<00:04:31.690> pommel<00:04:32.380> like

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
it doesn't have a proper pommel like

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.120 
it doesn't have a proper pommel like
most<00:04:34.050> sabers<00:04:35.050> have<00:04:35.200> that<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.560> can<00:04:35.710> screw<00:04:35.950> off

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
most sabers have that you can screw off

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.640 
most sabers have that you can screw off
I<00:04:36.370> got<00:04:37.330> lucky<00:04:37.510> though<00:04:37.810> because<00:04:37.990> when<00:04:38.290> I<00:04:38.320> cut

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
I got lucky though because when I cut

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.250 
I got lucky though because when I cut
this<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.880> first<00:04:40.120> time<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.360> had<00:04:40.450> cut<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.660> pipe<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
this the first time I had cut a pipe and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.409 
this the first time I had cut a pipe and
I<00:04:41.710> cut<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:41.980> too<00:04:42.130> quickly<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.610> as<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.270> can<00:04:43.390> see

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
I cut it too quickly and as you can see

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.720 
I cut it too quickly and as you can see
it<00:04:43.630> could<00:04:43.750> pinched<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.410> little<00:04:44.680> bit<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.040> got

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
it could pinched a little bit I got

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.380 
it could pinched a little bit I got
pinched<00:04:46.060> just<00:04:46.360> enough<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:48.390> 36

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
pinched just enough that this 36

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.370 
pinched just enough that this 36
millimeter<00:04:51.060> drain<00:04:52.060> or<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.270> strainer<00:04:52.600> whatever

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
millimeter drain or a strainer whatever

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.260 
millimeter drain or a strainer whatever
you<00:04:53.440> call<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.610> know<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.850> thing<00:04:55.210> you

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
you call it you know the thing you

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.390 
you call it you know the thing you
attached<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> dream<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:57.210> sink<00:04:58.210> or<00:04:58.360> whatever

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
attached to a dream a sink or whatever

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.110 
attached to a dream a sink or whatever
fit<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.550> without<00:05:01.390> slipping<00:05:01.930> out<00:05:02.610> yeah<00:05:03.610> it<00:05:03.970> was

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
fit in without slipping out yeah it was

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.800 
fit in without slipping out yeah it was
a<00:05:04.150> little<00:05:04.240> bit<00:05:04.390> loose<00:05:04.600> though<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.590> stuck<00:05:05.950> a

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
a little bit loose though so I stuck a

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.700 
a little bit loose though so I stuck a
spare<00:05:07.810> oh<00:05:09.510> this<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:10.660> called<00:05:10.870> an<00:05:10.990> o-ring<00:05:11.200> which

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
spare oh this is called an o-ring which

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.670 
spare oh this is called an o-ring which
i<00:05:12.100> also<00:05:12.280> got<00:05:12.520> from<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.180> custom<00:05:14.140> saber<00:05:14.410> shop

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
i also got from the custom saber shop

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.980 
i also got from the custom saber shop
that<00:05:15.490> would<00:05:15.850> be<00:05:15.970> fine<00:05:16.120> temporary<00:05:16.600> solution

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
that would be fine temporary solution

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.690 
that would be fine temporary solution
sunday<00:05:17.410> off<00:05:17.530> do<00:05:18.280> something<00:05:18.520> about<00:05:18.610> it

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
sunday off do something about it

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.460 
sunday off do something about it
probably<00:05:19.120> black<00:05:19.300> would<00:05:19.540> be<00:05:19.900> better<00:05:20.080> anyway

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
probably black would be better anyway

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.250 
probably black would be better anyway
and<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:22.150> that's<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:23.250> new<00:05:24.250> physics<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.419> and

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
and so that's the new physics of it and

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.200 
and so that's the new physics of it and
let's<00:05:26.470> see<00:05:27.280> how<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.490> works<00:05:27.900> now<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.650> said

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
let's see how it works now the I said

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.320 
let's see how it works now the I said
well<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.479> hasbro<00:05:32.940> boys<00:05:33.940> have<00:05:34.180> their<00:05:34.270> own

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
well the hasbro boys have their own

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.170 
well the hasbro boys have their own
faults<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.020> one<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:36.220> biggest<00:05:36.700> fault<00:05:37.030> is

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
faults on this one the biggest fault is

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.300 
faults on this one the biggest fault is
the<00:05:37.300> fact<00:05:37.510> that<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.690> flashes<00:05:38.410> three<00:05:39.040> times

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
the fact that it flashes three times

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.860 
the fact that it flashes three times
when<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.850> turn<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.090> on<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.450> when<00:05:40.570> you<00:05:40.660> turn<00:05:40.840> it

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
when you turn it on and when you turn it

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.610 
when you turn it on and when you turn it
off<00:05:44.160> like<00:05:45.160> that

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
off like that

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.930 
off like that
but<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.710> has<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.860> nice<00:05:48.070> hum<00:05:48.400> an<00:05:49.120> idol<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.670> has

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
but it has a nice hum an idol and it has

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.920 
but it has a nice hum an idol and it has
a<00:05:54.970> decent<00:05:55.630> class<00:05:55.960> i'll<00:05:57.480> see<00:05:58.480> there's<00:05:58.660> even<00:05:58.870> a

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
a decent class i'll see there's even a

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.750 
a decent class i'll see there's even a
little<00:05:59.080> bit<00:05:59.170> of<00:05:59.320> variation<00:05:59.590> there<00:06:03.540> the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
little bit of variation there the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.940 
little bit of variation there the
variant<00:06:06.760> is<00:06:07.170> class<00:06:08.170> now<00:06:08.410> followed<00:06:08.800> by<00:06:08.920> a

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
variant is class now followed by a

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.100 
variant is class now followed by a
little<00:06:09.250> motion<00:06:10.000> sound<00:06:10.270> which<00:06:10.780> is<00:06:10.900> good

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
little motion sound which is good

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.270 
little motion sound which is good
because<00:06:11.320> it<00:06:11.500> has<00:06:12.160> no<00:06:12.190> motion<00:06:13.350> sensor<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:14.590> swing

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
because it has no motion sensor so swing

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.010 
because it has no motion sensor so swing
it<00:06:15.370> around<00:06:15.460> all<00:06:15.670> you<00:06:15.760> want<00:06:15.790> that<00:06:16.150> you're<00:06:16.930> not

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
it around all you want that you're not

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.720 
it around all you want that you're not
going<00:06:17.200> to<00:06:17.260> get<00:06:17.350> any<00:06:17.530> special<00:06:17.980> effect<00:06:18.430> they're

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
going to get any special effect they're

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.650 
going to get any special effect they're
just<00:06:19.390> too<00:06:19.510> bad<00:06:20.700> but<00:06:21.700> otherwise<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:22.270> think<00:06:22.420> it's

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
just too bad but otherwise I think it's

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.710 
just too bad but otherwise I think it's
great<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:23.110> like<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.830> Corbin<00:06:24.250> style<00:06:24.670> the<00:06:25.420> core

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
great I like the Corbin style the core

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.690 
great I like the Corbin style the core
and<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.400> kind<00:06:27.400> of<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:28.380> light<00:06:29.380> sort<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.860> broken<00:06:30.490> up

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
and a kind of a light sort of broken up

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.200 
and a kind of a light sort of broken up
it<00:06:30.850> looks<00:06:31.000> more<00:06:31.210> natural<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.660> me<00:06:31.930> I'll<00:06:33.210> show

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210
