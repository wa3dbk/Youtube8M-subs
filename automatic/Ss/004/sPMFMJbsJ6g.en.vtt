00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.760
 depth 2 by 2 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.970
 we dig out here everything will turn out very 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.970
 compactly 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:04.250
 so here so we gently do so 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.620
 Here we have here so now 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.550
 what we do is take it all 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.550
 shutting down 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 So 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.380
 and one side so here you have 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.530
 it should happen now I'll write 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.360
 close to the end 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.360
 so here I am thinking of making glass 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.340
 fine so no so here we will 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.910

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.590
 sure we put glass now and 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:11.850
 by doing so now we will do next 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.090
 So we put the glass 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.090
 well, like this 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:26.030
 perfect so now yes here and 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.430
 fill it with water 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.430
 so some water we have where the sword 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:42.820
 and the like that is excellent so there is no way stop 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.440
 need one more trick from 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.020
 so here is so fine here we can not 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.020
 do now again 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.020

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:05.220
 yes you still glass and hatch hatch to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:09.140
 I took the water glass that's why so much so 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.700
 take doing like this and put the hatch 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.670
 here us 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.480
 pancakes glass apparently not put oh well 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.480
 put the boards 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.910
 OK, let's just leave it like this 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:33.080
 we threw with you the chicken and the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.090
 thus breaking down the block here as we can see we have 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.630
 morning meets leave right 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:47.650
 right now take a quartz block 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:54.180
 damn business anywhere so now we still do 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.180
 so here and take a sign 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.900
 we put everything here and so you should 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:07.590
 turn out 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.269
 I even stop stop stop stop like that yes 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.420
 so here is what should happen and 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:19.079
 put the chest there is no go here here 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.750
 put the chest and so here and see 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.440
 what do you get now take 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.440
 egg 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:35.099
 damn veins must have slept that will save 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.720
 their will be anise mcqueen egg and so here 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:43.940
 quietly on the decline of chickens quietly 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:48.050
 but I still do not work 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.620
 on the sly so here we spawn them 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.030
 quietly thus and I advise you 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.590
 build it further away from home because 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:01.349
 I will tell you so much 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.940
 gets on your nerves and thereby and will 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.800
 everyone is very loud so dakota chickens 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.550
 here is of course some dead 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.820
 die before it happens nothing like that 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.909
 this is not as you can see they quietly fly 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.210
 thereby you through this pipe will be 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.210
 flow eggs the most yes 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.250
 so stop stop stop before you everything will flow 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:38.420
 and in general, such a compact 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:41.420
 This farm is very easy to do and 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.880
 you all can pick up the principle we take 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.910
 put the chest that can not yet be opened 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.800
 and there can all put well think it 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.060
 Tutorial will help you if 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.440
