00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.820
 let's learn how to clean the airbrush 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.289
 here we have the airbrush connected to 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.210
 compressor turned on then the material 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:21.310
 that we are going to use is the following 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.310
 ap is cap napkins are 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 and use of crystals according 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.759
 I usually know what they put in the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.199
 bottles that sell you as a cleaner 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.059
 airbrushes or that you can 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.040
 simplify life a lot with this by 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.649
 at least for acrylics and makeups already 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.360
 either water based or silicone works 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.980
 then here we have put in clean 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 crystals 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 let's put your finger in front of the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.970
 nozzle and I'm going to press it down not 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.970
 I'm going to press down back 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.050
 sometimes 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.300
 we started to spray 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.130
 in the bowl 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.610
 villeta the truth that would be 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.610
 practically 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.750
 so then this is the process 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.390
 what are we doing until we see that 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.979
 it leaves us totally fluid without problems 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 it's transparent 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.700
 in the country 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.859
 above all, do not put clubs of the 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.420
 ears because the hairs are left 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:44.329
 inside and it will obstruct the airbrush 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.920
 We can use napkins sometimes even 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.500
 make-up remover if it's for makeup 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.979
 reserves take on makeup wipes 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.979
 make-up remover 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.159
 emptying now another way to do it 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:02.549
 a little easier 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.549
 we take the gaming glass cleaner 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.200
 and we dump it 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.520
 already when in the end say good because 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 It's almost clean 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.709
 choose 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.200
 and when I assure you is the result 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.280
 it is clean to use it is very 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.280
 important always 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.530
 very good , we have it clean
