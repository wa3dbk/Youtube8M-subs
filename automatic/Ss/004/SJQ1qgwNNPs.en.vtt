00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 very visited the dow we are in 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.120
 minecraft 1.7 point 10 let's see a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 minimum of 8 mod 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.250
 robots the one that I like very much already you know 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.740
 that adds a kind of table and kraft eo 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480
 new but I thought it was quite 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.190
 quite useful 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.539
 It's cool as always, I have to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.560
 be doing parkour in the trees 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 that I shut up if I'm not calm and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.470
 let's see the mod that adds this here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.380
 work bndg 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.059
 this weird that already only in the hand already 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.520
 It looks like it has many details but 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.000
 good is done with a casting table a 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.290
 chest and all the rest of refined wood 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.820
 and where do we put it 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.040
 and we go there 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.829
 is that I do not like that there is much much 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.420
 load in the middle and in the desert 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.980
 I always do it like this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.379
 for example that there are no trees and nothing 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.780
 look here it's fine 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.750
 chan chan chan is so the gesture 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.190
 answer is a verse uncle I love 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.190
 the design that has monkey heap 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
 and how it works like a 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.440
 crafting table really but it has 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.150
 some functions that has moored as per 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.790
 example that this is that I love or 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 simply if we put a chest 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.570
 for example you are going to put to the right 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.670
 and as you see if we click here we 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
 appears here the chest itself this can 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 be very good if we have to do 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.600
 many craft eos because we put all 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.220
 the materials in the chests here 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 if we are using another mode for example 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 that needs a lot we put the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.840
 pot materials in that in this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.689
 here for example or left 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.579
 in this one here and we can directly 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.649
 go doing it like that without having to mess 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.729
 of our inventory is very good 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.760
 you can also put the chests 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.260
 double 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.290
 and there you see how huge it is already 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.670
 I say cool as cool a long time 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 things get into the chests likewise 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 although we regret from here and we 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.630
 allows to work very comfortable the truth is 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.060
 that I like that a lot apart from the fact that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.130
 design is super good to decorate 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.300
 with all the drawers here the problem 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.500
 is that we put a chest here 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.120
 then it 's a shame now 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.459
 everyone works is to be touching 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.970
 but when you put a chest here, this is covered 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.350
 the bad thing back here I do not think they're going to 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.540
 do not 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.640
 well below and above, but not as 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 I say tapas this here that I like 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.349
 how much is left to decorate and that 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.359
 but what is much better to have this 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.670
 the truth but good that is the minimum or 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.800
 txiki mod or minibus that as saying 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.000
 do not add almost anything in fact 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 it's weird 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.270
 so weird because you do not see this here 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.010
 it looks 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.410
 as you see, or to decorate 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 discomfort may look good 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.450
 in fact one wing of another also wants 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.860
 survival problems that clear the of 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.690
 the left has contact with the chest 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.920
 on the left the one on the right with the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.830
 chest of the right of the mention not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.750
 serves for that they serve to decorate but 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.990
 As you can see, it was superchulo but good 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.090
 you have the description is for 1.7 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.360
 10 points if I was satisfied etc as 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.360
 forever 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.920
 bye
