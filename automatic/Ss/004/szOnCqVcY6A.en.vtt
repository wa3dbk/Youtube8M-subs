 gabriel garcÃ­a marquez 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.820
 something very serious is going to happen in this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.820
 village 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.340
 imagine you a very small town 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.890
 where there is an old lady who has two 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:26.259
 children one of 17 and a daughter of 14 is 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.349
 serving it is breakfast and has a 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.820
 expression of concern the children 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.250
 they ask what's wrong and she responds 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.250
 I do not know but I woke up with the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.400
 feeling that something very serious is going 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.610
 to happen to this town 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.250
 they laugh at the mother they say that those 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.880
 they are forebodings of old things that 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.440
 They spend the son going to play pool and 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.170
 at the moment you are going to throw a 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.490
 carambola very simple the other player 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 he says he has put a burden on you not to 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.159
 you do 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.270
 everyone laughs he laughs throws the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.479
 carambola and it does not 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.259
 he pays his weight and everyone asks him what 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.009
 it happened if it was a simple carom 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:21.020
 answer is true but I have stayed 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.450
 worry about one thing that my 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.030
 mother this morning about something serious that 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.270
 is going to happen in this town 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.090
 everyone laughs at him and he who has 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 gained his weight he returns to his house where 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.060
 is with your mom or a granddaughter or in short 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.860
 any happy relative with his weight 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.380
 He says 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.640
 and I won this weight by dÃ¡maso in the form 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.350
 simpler because he is a fool 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 and because he is a foolish man because he 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.340
 I can make a very simple carom 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.920
 cluttered with the idea that his mom 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.760
 dawned today with the idea that something very 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.610
 serious will happen in this town 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.350
 then your mother tells you do not tease 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.280
 of the hunches of the old 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.880
 because sometimes they leave the relative hears 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.170
 and she's going to buy meat she says to the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.630
 Butcher selling good meat book and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.840
 at the moment they are cutting it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.870
 add better sale me two because they walk 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.450
 saying something serious is going to happen and what 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 it's better to be prepared 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.800
 the butcher dispatched his meat and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.340
 when it comes to another lady buy a 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.830
 pound of meat says take two because 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.840
 So far people come saying that 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.480
 something very serious is going to happen and they are 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.690
 preparing and buying things 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.860
 then the old one responds I have several 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 children look better give me four pounds it 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.599
 leads to four pounds and for not 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.790
 make the story long I will say that the 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.180
 Butcher in half an hour runs out of meat 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.180
 kills another cow sells all and leaves 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.910
 spreading the rumor comes the moment in 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 that everyone in the town is 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.459
 waiting for something to happen paralyzes the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.760
 activities and suddenly at two o'clock 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.540
 late it's hot as always someone 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.519
 He says 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.640
 has realized the heat that is 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.760
 doing but in this town always 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.489
 it has been hot 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.370
 so hot that it's a town where 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.590
 musicians had patched instruments 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.409
 with pitch and always touched the shadow 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.760
 because if they touched the sun they would fall 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:43.330
 pieces however says one 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 at this time it has never been so hot 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.280
 but 2 o'clock in the afternoon is when there is more 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.030
 heat yes but not as hot as now 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.800
 to the desert town to the deserted square 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.760
 suddenly a little bird comes down and runs 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.189
 voice there is a little bird in the square 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.849
 and everyone is scared to see the 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:11.140
 little bird but gentlemen there has always been 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.380
 little birds that come down yes but never to this 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.900
 hour 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.209
 There comes a moment of such tension for the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.370
 inhabitants of the village that everyone is 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.350
 desperate to leave and do not have the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.080
 courage to do it 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:28.430
 I am very macho yell one I go 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.950
 your children grab their furniture 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.350
 animal puts them in the cart and 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.290
 it crosses the central street where the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.500
 poor town watching it so far 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.190
 what do they say if he dares 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:46.070
 we also leave and start 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.580
 literally dismantle the town it 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.350
 they carry things the animals all and one 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.050
 of the last that leaves the town 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.330
 says do not come misfortune fall 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.000
 about what's left of our house and 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.930
 then he burns it and others burn 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.270
 also their houses flee in a tremendous and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.460
 true panic as in an exodus of 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.220
 war and in the middle of them goes to the 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.130
 lady who had the foreshadowing cry 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.750
 I said something very serious was going to happen and I 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.750
 They said I was crazy
