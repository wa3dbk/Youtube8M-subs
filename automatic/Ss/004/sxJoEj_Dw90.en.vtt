00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.340
 guitar seed 2013 guitars 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.510
 all forms of guitars all the 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.800
 curvatures of guitars like no 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.880
 possible guitars like that by 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.560
 example is that it was going very 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.660
 quickly watch this is a guitar to 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.220
 resonator this is the top of the luxury of the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.330
 world resonator guitar this is the 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.950
 resonator guitar made by 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.059
 sir mike lewis who is english but 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.320
 who does not live in England because 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.760
 he lives next to paris it's by 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.410
 England otherwise it would be 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.670
 it's a resonator guitar which 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.289
 is very rare it is in the work of 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.640
 mike lewis and who makes his own 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.960
 resonator system this guitar to 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.430
 resonator and s is amplified 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.990
 mechanically it's a guitar 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.699
 mechanically amplified with a code in 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.840
 aluminum inside the guitar 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.729
 it's absolutely completely 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.019
 Spooky as an instrument - if 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:35.469
 it was me that would make me completely 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.850
 crazy 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.819
 the work of Mike Lewis is beautiful 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.739
 mainly because there is 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:44.109
 wooden decor either metal bodies 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.389
 that's a wooden body in multiplies 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.159
 maple is a beauty to shatter 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.420
 the French head I ask you not to 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.499
 to smash your head immediately because 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.569
 you're going to play a piece after all of 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.709
 following on this beta maple flames 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.569
 and maple as if we 've never seen 

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:58.089
 the saddle as if we dreamed to see brief 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.739
 it's pretty rare is enough 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.989
 important to say mike's work 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.909
 lewis is one of the few months for me 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.190
 it's their army it's the only one to 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.900
 to compete with the sound of 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.420
 famous resonator guitar of the years 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.400
 20 the famous national of the 20s 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.170
 there you have a perfect example it's a 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.760
 single caunes and I think franÃ§ois 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.740
 if you have a blue shirt like that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.240
 it is to make this cone smoke 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.240
 mike lewis it's gone 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.400
