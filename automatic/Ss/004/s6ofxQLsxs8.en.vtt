00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello my name is evgeny sparrows 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.360
 This guitar will pass and power today we 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.360
 we will analyze this type of bureau 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.040
 and 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.190
 I'll tell you right away don't be scared 9 strokes 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.400
 it's not so much divide this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.180
 the device into two parts and all you have 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.580
 will turn out 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:50.320
 start clamping chord em and go 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.890
 mouse 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 then again then twice a century 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.309
 and then the second part 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.150
 once again you are not 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.970
 twice up fast 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.600
 then 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.440
 faster pace you get 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.689
 and 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.860
 and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.370
 go 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.830
 most likely no questions given 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.660
 kind of fight you did not have if you 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.300
 all the same something does not work write me 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.070
 in the comments reasons that you have 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 specifically do not go out necessarily 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.850
 I will try to help you if you 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.070

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070
 until
