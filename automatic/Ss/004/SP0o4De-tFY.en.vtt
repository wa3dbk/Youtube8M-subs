00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.760
 hair loss is pathological 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.370
 there are some periods in a person's life 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.379
 when hair loss is physiological 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.080
 norm for example in children under one year old 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:42.420

 this condition is observed in adolescents 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.970
 during puberty 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.470
 all these states are physiological then 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.290

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.449
 passion does not need what most 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.519
 parents often face when we 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.210
 completely 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.030
