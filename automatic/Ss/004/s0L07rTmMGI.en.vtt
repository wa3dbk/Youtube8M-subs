00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.280 
movie I'm mr. blue summers so this week
I'll<00:00:14.000> be<00:00:14.059> showing<00:00:14.210> you<00:00:14.599> a<00:00:14.630> quick<00:00:14.840> technique

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
I'll be showing you a quick technique

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.890 
I'll be showing you a quick technique
that<00:00:15.589> you<00:00:15.710> can<00:00:15.740> use<00:00:15.889> to<00:00:16.760> create<00:00:16.910> smooth<00:00:17.480> text

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
that you can use to create smooth text

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.040 
that you can use to create smooth text
in<00:00:18.020> 3d<00:00:18.410> studio<00:00:18.470> max<00:00:19.359> often<00:00:20.359> times<00:00:20.539> this<00:00:20.750> can<00:00:20.930> be

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
in 3d studio max often times this can be

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.779 
in 3d studio max often times this can be
a<00:00:21.080> little<00:00:21.350> bit<00:00:21.439> hard<00:00:21.710> because<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
a little bit hard because the

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.939 
a little bit hard because the
turbosmooth<00:00:23.689> modifier<00:00:23.720> doesn't<00:00:24.650> do<00:00:24.769> well

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
turbosmooth modifier doesn't do well

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.160 
turbosmooth modifier doesn't do well
with<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.730> polygons<00:00:26.210> on<00:00:26.420> the<00:00:26.510> top<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:26.990> bottom

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
with the polygons on the top and bottom

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.580 
with the polygons on the top and bottom
of<00:00:27.439> your<00:00:27.500> text<00:00:28.480> I'm<00:00:29.480> going<00:00:29.539> to<00:00:29.810> type<00:00:30.140> in<00:00:30.320> some

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
of your text I'm going to type in some

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.670 
of your text I'm going to type in some
demo<00:00:31.550> text<00:00:31.910> here<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:34.960> I'm<00:00:35.960> going<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.380> apply<00:00:36.590> a

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
demo text here and I'm going to apply a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.600 
demo text here and I'm going to apply a
shell<00:00:37.040> modifier<00:00:37.930> in<00:00:38.930> order<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.290> get<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:39.649> into

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
shell modifier in order to get that into

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.200 
shell modifier in order to get that into
a<00:00:40.640> 3d<00:00:41.059> object<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.570> we<00:00:41.690> can<00:00:41.809> work<00:00:41.989> with<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
a 3d object that we can work with so the

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.299 
a 3d object that we can work with so the
goal<00:00:44.360> here<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.809> to<00:00:45.440> smooth<00:00:45.739> out<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.100> object

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
goal here is to smooth out this object

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.650 
goal here is to smooth out this object
so<00:00:46.579> we<00:00:46.730> don't<00:00:46.879> get<00:00:47.000> these<00:00:47.090> hard<00:00:47.450> edges

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
so we don't get these hard edges

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.619 
so we don't get these hard edges
everywhere<00:00:48.250> but<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.370> trouble<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.000> text

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
everywhere but the trouble is that text

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.350 
everywhere but the trouble is that text
like<00:00:50.780> this<00:00:51.020> has<00:00:51.730> polygons<00:00:52.730> on<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.000> top<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
like this has polygons on the top and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.350 
like this has polygons on the top and
bottom<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.719> each<00:00:53.870> letter<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:55.610> are<00:00:56.000> very

and make sure it's not intersecting any
of<00:01:45.049> your<00:01:45.200> geometry<00:01:46.000> so<00:01:47.000> just<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.299> that<00:01:48.040> I'm

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
of your geometry so just like that I'm

going to select my text again and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.249 
going to select my text again and
convert<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.970> pro<00:01:53.210> boolean<00:01:53.570> object<00:01:53.990> so

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
convert it to a pro boolean object so

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.469

picking and I'm gonna select that cube

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.309 
picking and I'm gonna select that cube
so<00:02:07.939> it's<00:02:08.090> not<00:02:08.209> going<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.509> make<00:02:08.629> any<00:02:08.840> change<00:02:09.170> to

so it's not going to make any change to

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.920 
so it's not going to make any change to
my<00:02:09.440> geometry<00:02:09.819> but<00:02:10.819> what<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.150> does<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.840> you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
my geometry but what that does and you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.170 
my geometry but what that does and you
have<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.260> do<00:02:12.379> that<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.940> make<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
have to do that is make this a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.410 
have to do that is make this a
legitimate<00:02:14.810> proboolean<00:02:15.319> object<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.420> that's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
legitimate proboolean object and that's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.300 
legitimate proboolean object and that's
what<00:02:17.599> will<00:02:17.720> enable<00:02:17.930> under<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> Advanced

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
what will enable under the Advanced

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.670 
what will enable under the Advanced
Options<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.269> quadrilateral<00:02:20.989> tessellation

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
Options the quadrilateral tessellation

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.780 
Options the quadrilateral tessellation
which<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.610> right<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.239> group<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
which is right here in this group when I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.089 
which is right here in this group when I
click<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.090> make<00:02:26.569> quadrilaterals<00:02:27.440> you'll

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
click on make quadrilaterals you'll

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.309 
click on make quadrilaterals you'll
notice<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:28.700> now<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.330> pro<00:02:29.569> boolean<00:02:29.959> object

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
notice that now the pro boolean object

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.740 
notice that now the pro boolean object
takes<00:02:30.560> care<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.860> these<00:02:31.069> weird<00:02:31.340> shapes<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:32.630> it

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
takes care of these weird shapes and it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.580 
takes care of these weird shapes and it
tries<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.019> tessellate<00:02:33.620> them<00:02:33.860> intelligently

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
tries to tessellate them intelligently

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.350 
tries to tessellate them intelligently
this<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.769> little<00:02:37.069> bit<00:02:37.250> low<00:02:37.579> for<00:02:38.150> what<00:02:38.180> I'm

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
this is a little bit low for what I'm

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720 
this is a little bit low for what I'm
looking<00:02:38.690> for<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.140> going<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.410> increase<00:02:39.730> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
looking for so I'm going to increase the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.270 
looking for so I'm going to increase the
number<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.390> quads<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.110> go<00:02:42.500> into<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.799> object

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
number of quads that go into this object

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.000 
number of quads that go into this object
by<00:02:43.549> reducing<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.329> quad<00:02:44.599> size<00:02:44.930> in<00:02:45.260> this

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
by reducing the quad size in this

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.039 
by reducing the quad size in this
spinner<00:02:46.360> I'm<00:02:47.360> going<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.660> go<00:02:47.750> from<00:02:47.930> 3%<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:50.049> try

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
spinner I'm going to go from 3% to try

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.860 
spinner I'm going to go from 3% to try
point<00:02:51.349> eight<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.760> eight<00:02:52.940> tenths<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.480> percent

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
point eight so eight tenths of a percent

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.559 
point eight so eight tenths of a percent
maybe<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.290> little<00:02:54.410> bit<00:02:54.560> lower<00:02:55.329> point<00:02:56.329> five

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
maybe a little bit lower point five

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.039 
maybe a little bit lower point five
there<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.349> go<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> half<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.450> percent<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
there we go so half of a percent and

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.539 
there we go so half of a percent and
this<00:03:00.349> will<00:03:00.470> change<00:03:00.739> depending<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> size

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
this will change depending on the size

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.819 
this will change depending on the size
of<00:03:01.670> your<00:03:01.730> scene<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:03.049> now<00:03:03.230> you'll<00:03:03.470> see<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> have

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
of your scene but now you'll see I have

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.400 
of your scene but now you'll see I have
tons<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.400> tons<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.730> quads<00:03:05.090> all<00:03:05.870> over<00:03:06.290> this

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
tons and tons of quads all over this

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.920 
tons and tons of quads all over this
object<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.269> when<00:03:08.269> i<00:03:08.299> apply<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.750> turbosmooth

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
object so when i apply the turbosmooth

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.370 
object so when i apply the turbosmooth
modifier<00:03:10.239> back<00:03:11.239> here<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.720> modify<00:03:12.470> panel

modifier back here in the modify panel
you'll<00:03:15.380> notice<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:15.889> get<00:03:15.950> nice<00:03:16.280> smooth

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
you'll notice that I get nice smooth

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.349 
you'll notice that I get nice smooth
letters<00:03:18.280> now<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.400> takes<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.670> lot<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:19.850> polygons

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
letters now it takes a lot of polygons

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.240 
letters now it takes a lot of polygons
to<00:03:20.600> do<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.319> it's<00:03:21.560> not<00:03:21.620> great<00:03:21.920> for<00:03:22.160> low

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
to do this so it's not great for low

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.890 
to do this so it's not great for low
poly<00:03:22.489> work<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.540> great<00:03:23.840> for

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
poly work it's not that great for

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.949 
poly work it's not that great for
animation<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.519> looks<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:25.970> superb<00:03:26.510> when

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
animation but it looks just superb when

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:27.879 
animation but it looks just superb when
you're<00:03:27.109> doing<00:03:27.319> these<00:03:27.440> high<00:03:27.709> resolution

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
you're doing these high resolution

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.150 
you're doing these high resolution
renders<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.049> that's<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.200> technique<00:03:30.530> that's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
renders and that's the technique that's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.759 
renders and that's the technique that's
how<00:03:31.340> you<00:03:31.400> get<00:03:31.639> nice<00:03:31.880> smooth<00:03:32.450> letters<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.049> 3d

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
how you get nice smooth letters in 3d
