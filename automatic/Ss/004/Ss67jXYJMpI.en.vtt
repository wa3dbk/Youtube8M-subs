some<00:00:14.250> assault<00:00:14.549> mode<00:00:14.700> again<00:00:15.320> defense<00:00:16.320> mode<00:00:16.529> I'd

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
some assault mode again defense mode I'd

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.230 
some assault mode again defense mode I'd
not<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.550> anymore<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.850> sort<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
not really like it anymore I sort of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.939

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
it's just I don't remember them where I

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.270 
it's just I don't remember them where I
need<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.510> say<00:01:43.690> them<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.050> don't<00:01:44.260> know<00:01:44.350> but<00:01:45.160> yeah

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
need to say them I don't know but yeah

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.250 
need to say them I don't know but yeah
it<00:01:45.490> looks<00:01:45.670> like<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:45.910> probably<00:01:46.180> will<00:01:46.540> unless

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
it looks like you probably will unless

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.900 
it looks like you probably will unless
he<00:01:47.530> doesn't<00:01:47.800> look<00:01:48.070> pretty<00:01:48.340> stupid<00:01:48.580> for<00:01:48.820> him

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
he doesn't look pretty stupid for him

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.430 
he doesn't look pretty stupid for him
not<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> oh<00:01:49.390> I'm<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:49.960> sure<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.229> he<00:01:50.290> actually

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
not to oh I'm not sure if he actually

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.310 
not to oh I'm not sure if he actually
has<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.280> upgrade<00:01:51.610> yet<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:52.750> last<00:01:52.960> one<00:01:53.200> that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
has that upgrade yet the last one that

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.600 
has that upgrade yet the last one that
stuns<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.740> balloons<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.100> don't<00:01:54.250> think<00:01:54.399> he<00:01:54.460> has

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
stuns the balloons I don't think he has

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.800 
stuns the balloons I don't think he has
that<00:01:54.759> that<00:01:54.940> would<00:01:55.030> be<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.119> only<00:01:55.330> way<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.720> you

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
that that would be the only way that you

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.359 
that that would be the only way that you
could<00:01:55.960> really<00:01:56.140> stop<00:01:56.470> rainbow<00:01:56.890> brush<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.160> unless

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
could really stop rainbow brush I unless

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.560 
could really stop rainbow brush I unless
he<00:01:57.520> has<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> boomerang<00:01:58.030> or<00:01:58.210> something<00:01:58.509> like

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
he has a boomerang or something like

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.900 
he has a boomerang or something like
that<00:01:58.630> but<00:01:59.380> it's<00:01:59.680> not<00:01:59.920> looking<00:02:00.310> like<00:02:00.580> he<00:02:00.700> does

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
that but it's not looking like he does

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.310 
that but it's not looking like he does
if<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.240> knew<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.420> third<00:02:01.750> tower<00:02:01.990> that'd<00:02:02.229> be

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
if I knew that third tower that'd be

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.760 
if I knew that third tower that'd be
great<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.800> might<00:02:02.979> also<00:02:03.160> have<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:04.770> boomerang

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
great you might also have the boomerang

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.350 
great you might also have the boomerang

sending these balloons up looks like the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.240 
sending these balloons up looks like the
again<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.750> little<00:02:17.500> bit<00:02:17.650> close<00:02:17.950> for<00:02:17.980> my<00:02:18.220> liking

to do that oh that long tower is pretty

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.270 
to do that oh that long tower is pretty
be<00:02:53.940> afraid<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:54.769> yeah<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.920> might<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.069> his

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
be afraid there yeah that might be his

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.619 
be afraid there yeah that might be his
bonus<00:02:56.640> Tyra<00:02:56.970> might<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.209> actually<00:02:57.330> done<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
bonus Tyra might have actually done that

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.119 
bonus Tyra might have actually done that
I<00:02:58.019> don't<00:02:58.379> know<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.530> does<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.799> all<00:02:58.920> three

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
I don't know it does have all three

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.369 
I don't know it does have all three
towers<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.580> don't<00:02:59.819> think<00:03:00.120> he's<00:03:00.209> any<00:03:00.900> others

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
towers and don't think he's any others

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.080 
towers and don't think he's any others
but<00:03:02.280> we'll<00:03:02.459> see<00:03:02.730> we'll<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.569> does<00:03:05.090> so

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
but we'll see we'll see what he does so

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
but we'll see we'll see what he does so
far<00:03:06.330> he's<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.870> mean<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.290> boomerang<00:03:07.709> spot

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
far he's not I mean the boomerang spot

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.410 
far he's not I mean the boomerang spot
that<00:03:08.370> he<00:03:08.430> put<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.670> in<00:03:08.760> isn't<00:03:09.090> really<00:03:09.299> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
that he put it in isn't really that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.069 
that he put it in isn't really that
awful<00:03:09.629> but<00:03:09.930> he<00:03:10.079> goes<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.940> which<00:03:12.720> he<00:03:12.840> probably

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
awful but he goes for which he probably

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.460 
awful but he goes for which he probably
well<00:03:13.319> if<00:03:13.530> he<00:03:13.620> goes<00:03:13.769> for<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:15.019> labor<00:03:16.019> cachet

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
well if he goes for the labor cachet

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.949 
well if he goes for the labor cachet
then<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> mean<00:03:17.700> don't<00:03:17.909> really<00:03:18.599> matter<00:03:18.750> where
