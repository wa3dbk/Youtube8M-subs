00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.990
 be fine then today we get 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 found on a horror game that 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.529
 is called the plight I think it's 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.059
 says it's like it's a game 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.840
 amd horror that I found on belgian 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.460
 else we will test it 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.960
 today so I looked at a girl 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 and the story in that speaks of a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.750
 person who is called butt and in fact 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.940
 we must find his memories because 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 that he had a rather difficult past but 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 after we do not know more we go for it and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859
 I do not know if it's the beginning 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.720
 from a crowd or the main menu 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.910
 how are you going there is a special what is it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 a family so I do not know Asian 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 here we are going to say Asian 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.900
 it looks like little he had a little 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.279
 shot of photoshop on his eyes but 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.079
 if everything else goes well I think 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's him at home retaste taste here we go 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.750
 call him or I do not know how it says 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.920
 we'll call it you ok oh oh ok that to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.300
 background in the ears 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.040
 what intrigues me the most these two 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 people there is pretty gloomy 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.200
 so wait what they were all 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 barred and that in the grandmother she 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.899
 is a weird thing about these heavens there is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 Looks like she had burnt the mouth it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.690
 is that his eyes coming out and I have not 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.750
 too want to go there actually 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 of invention gently gently 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.420
 ah ah that's automatic what's that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 lives doing he's in the process of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 these places with a spoon this is his 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.560
 head yes your grandma that I was sure 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.560
 I was sure he turned his head 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.260
 these classes of agreement appears in a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.820
 house i think it's going to be his house 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.290
 we actually write it's not too big 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.170
 breasts I do not have so much of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.670
 the story but there are good bass 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.410
 we have nothing here that nothing to stay 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.510
 more but what is his room interacts 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.890
 all alone they are watching quietly 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.360
 yeah I did not understand why he 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.380
 watched everything see times the soil that's at 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.850
 to say that there is something here that's it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.230
 not been obliged to examine three times 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 when you never know those three 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.460
 children were found dead 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 three years after okay no we can 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
 do anything more with that and I have 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.700
 the impression of toddlers in this game 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.320
 you're scared of something that's in there 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.640
 that's why I do not trust 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.750
 jo in fact there is not really any 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.950
 this house we will try to find 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 something I do not know they're coming 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.190
 all she is pretty closed 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 okay it's closed is what we have here 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.060
 back there is a key I take then 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.630
 an old Chinese woman was found 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.790
 disabled 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.320
 I did not understand when to our chic for 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.340
 with children catane chic we see 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.630
 when you visited his house for 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 the moment is that a good visit 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.160
 go 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 yeah that there's no paid premiums 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.300
 the visit to toilets I'm afraid of what 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.739
 is said is it because peter I hear 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.870
 voices 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.880
 a floor and there is more light 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.930
 this is going to serve this ok 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.550
 adapting to play is good even time 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.690
 could select earlier in 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.690

 be careful then there we will be typing 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.820
 directly from verbal aggression it is 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.320
 that's the direct push months of the 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.190
 date for ceramics why this granny 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.810
 wants to kill his children 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.070
 I did not understand I spent your little ones 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.870
 children I do not know you're not going to kill them 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.830
 in France it does not exist like that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.180
 do not work like that in France 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.199
 that I'm starting to understand the game I 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.289
 think that in the end I would have totally 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.300
 understood but here we have to recover the 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.410
 doll stuff with water ah it's not 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.850
 the past they had down that is 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.510
 that it's like my bitter drawing it's 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.650
 too late to shit it's too late and 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.300
 I did not raise my head otherwise I 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.830
 jump start modem point is starting to see 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.010
 his memories believe what he does not think 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.580
 what happened at that moment down there I 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.260
 am a shit 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.090
 ok it was a weird tradition 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.169
 So that's where he screwed up in our is 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.880
 funny this representation they have 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.620
 just like everything is flooded 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.620
 part we will go back to the real world 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.430
 ok he turned to this kind of sink 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.840
 anniviers is it that's the last 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.919
 or no no there were three so that's 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.419
 well we have the three normally it's 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.289
 maybe the end of the game at the moulineaux 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.289
 part mill 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.119
 hello everyone you're fine I've 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.379
 afraid they'll jump on me right after 

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:55.119
 I look at this dessert he is unhappy 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.679
 because evil spirits control 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.990
 it's not finished in fact I'm not finished 

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.939
 still him there it's him lcl 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.229
 but he knows who it is not from here 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.999
 down if I was right and missed a 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.110
 nobody is there and joseph in three 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.429
 minutes at which I do not want to jump no 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:15.550
 I can not even jump fat so much 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:16.929
 trust hi ok I think that to 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.119
 do I really thought the end to 

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:20.110
 fencers been quite average frankly 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.669
 it's a game really he wanted 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.289
 really think about the mood we 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.999
 rather than the streamer good here it is 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.289
 a little horror game pretty cool games 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.830
 independents agree there will be others 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.909
 episodes 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.050
 tell me a comment under him that I 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.580
 do other episodes that are going to have 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.199
 on this game it can be nice it was
