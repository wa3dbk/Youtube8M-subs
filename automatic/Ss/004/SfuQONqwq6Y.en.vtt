00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.580
 we have absolutely no fun to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.580
 Ghana 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.579
 So I counted groups 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.289
 about three people for the people 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.400
 not a small one now 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.840
 Summary 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970
 Of course it was a super nice one 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.490
 meet as you can imagine 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.169
 The people are partially in train 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.850
 already wanted to get to know each other 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.230
 but have met in the main station 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.019
 train somehow already found 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.730
 because of that many fruits 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:45.010
 were transported and only then 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.960
 The most people came to notice 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.559
 here already from the environment I would 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.710
 say 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.210
 the catchment area bar is 300 kilometers 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.239
 around dÃ¼sseldorf around it 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.559
 We had people from Heidelberg there and 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.129
 we had goddesses today 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.629
 that was the furthest correct me 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.670
 if we take any farther away 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.290
 but I think that's the way it is 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.880
 at least that's what got stuck with me 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.420
 is 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 they were really great people 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 a broadcast had you on 500 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.259
 could really recognize meters already 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.360
 great, just great 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.170
 open minded and full of fat 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.700
 have grin on her face just the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 They are all great from the beginning 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.950
 So nobody understood that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.539
 need not stand outside and could not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 with turn or something they have 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.369
 all really directly on each other 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.950
 crashed and really great 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.929
 understood and well maintained 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.539
 Many thanks again to the 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.240
 heidelberger to the team of the 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.830
 I'll tell nicoletta about the woman 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.970
 because of here on youtube 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.259
 that has a food sharing 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.659
 project because in heidelberg 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
 she started and thereby conditioned 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.580
 then brought a lot of fruit and whole 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.759
 many pears and apples will have juice 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.910
 made of it and distributed to us all 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.410
 and that was really delicious 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.510
 has the meeting against the once again so 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.060
 so would bring another level 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.280
 I say I link the video 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.600
 her again in the infobox and I 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.090
 I did another interview with her 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.470
 there you can also shoot sharia 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 you can stand on your legs in any city 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.269
 put 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.489
 then maybe you just have that too 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.590
 to make time and to save food 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.900
 who do not want at all but are 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.340
 be shown as a waste because they are 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.970
 can not be sold well anymore 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.780
 Anyway, that's a great topic 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.989
 stress worth repeating in every case 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 and the talk did not turn 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.569
 really talking shop 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.360
 there were are all sorts of talk 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.790
 just people are themselves 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.470
 have talked about god and the world 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.680
 and without prejudices without any 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.000
 demarcation just super cosmopolitan and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.560
 super warm simple , what should I 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 say 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.690
 just as I expected really so 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.250
 I expected exactly that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.709
 not expecting any big ones 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.079
 there are discussions or that any 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.180
 people go on each other or something 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.420
 So there 's no one there, I said yes 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.879
 so but I can under my heike 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.549
 but somehow also do not imagine it 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:36.799
 so at least the people that 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.560
 Staying with them longer is something 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.810
 on your legs in the city 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.810
 you know how it works 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.609
 facebook the nadia trÃ¶ger write 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.730
 for example how she did it where 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.739
 all the people invited and yes 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.419
 in which groups do they then group everything 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:59.900
 shared that event now 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:04:02.660
 exists and something like that said if 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.850
 you do not have any vegans in euros 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.840
 in the circle knows then just places 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.840
 self interest on the railway
