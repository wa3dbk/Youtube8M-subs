00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
through a lot but it's very realistic

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410 
through a lot but it's very realistic
and<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.159> relatable<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.939> she<00:01:30.060> goes<00:01:30.240> through

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and very relatable what she goes through

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
and very relatable what she goes through
even<00:01:30.720> though<00:01:30.900> she<00:01:30.960> lives<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> fantasy<00:01:31.920> world

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
even though she lives in a fantasy world

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.710 
even though she lives in a fantasy world
that<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.460> far<00:01:32.700> removed<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.240> own<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that is so far removed from our own so I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
that is so far removed from our own so I
really<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.290> enjoyed<00:01:34.590> her<00:01:34.770> arc<00:01:35.009> number<00:01:35.700> 4

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really really enjoyed her arc number 4

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
really really enjoyed her arc number 4
is<00:01:36.210> Juliet<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:37.079> shatter<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is Juliet from shatter me I know I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
is Juliet from shatter me I know I
talked<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.280> Warner<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> lot<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> character

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
talked about Warner a lot as a character

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
talked about Warner a lot as a character
but<00:01:39.960> Juliet's<00:01:40.409> character<00:01:41.009> arc<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
but Juliet's character arc is the one

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.510 
but Juliet's character arc is the one
that<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.259> all<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.619> within<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> shadow<00:01:44.310> me

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that it's all about within the shadow me

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
that it's all about within the shadow me
series<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> first<00:01:45.930> book<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
series because in the first book I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.230 
series because in the first book I
really<00:01:46.710> didn't<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.070> Julia<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> character

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
really didn't like Julia as a character

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200 
really didn't like Julia as a character
she<00:01:48.799> really<00:01:49.799> ran<00:01:50.220> away<00:01:50.250> from<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.880> things

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
she really ran away from a lot of things

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.090 
she really ran away from a lot of things
she's<00:01:51.570> been<00:01:51.750> through<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> lot<00:01:52.259> she's<00:01:52.649> very<00:01:52.829> kind

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
she's been through a lot she's very kind

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.039 
she's been through a lot she's very kind
of<00:01:53.130> traumatized<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.540> makes<00:01:54.720> sense<00:01:54.899> why

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of traumatized so it makes sense why

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.300 
of traumatized so it makes sense why
she's<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.590> she<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.100> really

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
she's the way that she is but I really

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.499 
she's the way that she is but I really
didn't<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.579> her<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.909> character<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
didn't like her as a character but the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
didn't like her as a character but the
way<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.810> she<00:01:58.020> grew<00:01:58.350> within<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> second<00:01:59.610> book

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
way that she grew within the second book

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.179 
way that she grew within the second book
and<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.149> third<00:02:00.479> book<00:02:00.659> especially<00:02:01.530> into<00:02:01.950> just

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and the third book especially into just

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999 
and the third book especially into just
a<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:02.759> strong<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.540> very<00:02:03.840> confident<00:02:04.439> character

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
a very strong a very confident character

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.180 
a very strong a very confident character
is<00:02:05.570> amazing<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.140> still<00:02:07.409> makes<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:07.860> smile

changer within this series and I really

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.509

character<00:03:46.849> did<00:03:46.970> regress<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.299> little<00:03:47.660> bit<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.260> I

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
character did regress a little bit so I

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.780 
character did regress a little bit so I
ultimately<00:03:48.980> couldn't<00:03:49.250> give<00:03:49.430> her<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.609> top

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
ultimately couldn't give her the top

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.699 
ultimately couldn't give her the top
spot<00:03:50.150> because<00:03:50.540> she<00:03:50.690> kind<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.109> back<00:03:51.290> pedaled<00:03:51.680> a

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
spot because she kind of back pedaled a

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.680 
spot because she kind of back pedaled a
little<00:03:51.919> bit<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.190> overall<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.239> one<00:03:53.359> of<00:03:53.450> my<00:03:53.510> most

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
little bit but overall so one of my most

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.900 
little bit but overall so one of my most
favorite<00:03:54.260> character<00:03:54.709> arcs<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.160> all<00:03:55.280> time<00:03:55.519> and

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
through so much and again this is going

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:23.879 
through so much and again this is going
to<00:04:23.630> be

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
to be

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.529 
to be
then<00:04:24.009> we're<00:04:24.159> gonna<00:04:24.280> see<00:04:24.490> even<00:04:24.819> more<00:04:24.999> of<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.330> so

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
then we're gonna see even more of it so

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:26.969 
then we're gonna see even more of it so
it's<00:04:25.719> not<00:04:26.080> only<00:04:26.259> the<00:04:26.469> development<00:04:26.949> that

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
it's not only the development that

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.040 
it's not only the development that
already<00:04:27.249> been<00:04:27.310> through<00:04:27.639> but<00:04:28.240> what<00:04:28.900> they're

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
already been through but what they're

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.959 
already been through but what they're
going<00:04:29.259> to<00:04:29.349> go<00:04:29.469> through<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.129> my<00:04:30.550> two<00:04:30.610> favorite

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
going to go through and my two favorite

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.600 
going to go through and my two favorite
characters<00:04:31.360> Magnus<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.110> Cleo<00:04:32.469> I<00:04:32.889> think<00:04:33.520> have

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
characters Magnus and Cleo I think have

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.129 
characters Magnus and Cleo I think have
gone<00:04:33.789> through<00:04:33.999> the<00:04:34.090> most<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.599> will<00:04:34.749> and<00:04:34.960> going

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
gone through the most and will and going

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.360 
gone through the most and will and going
through<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.349> most<00:04:35.620> they<00:04:35.860> are<00:04:35.889> completely

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370
