00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
think that's good too that's why he can

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.719 
think that's good too that's why he can
land<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.300> can<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.400> goes

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
land it and I can so this is what goes

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
land it and I can so this is what goes
through<00:01:56.760> my<00:01:56.970> head<00:01:57.090> tell<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.690> my<00:01:58.260> it's<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.470> kind

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
through my head tell me my it's all kind

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.980 
through my head tell me my it's all kind
of<00:01:58.710> crazy<00:01:59.150> so<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.420> set<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> regular

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of crazy so I just set up like a regular

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.890 
of crazy so I just set up like a regular
tray<00:02:01.380> foot<00:02:01.620> and<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.510> tre<00:02:03.690> flip

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
tray foot and when I do the tre flip

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.300 
tray foot and when I do the tre flip
it's<00:02:04.050> easy<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.410> get<00:02:04.530> mixed<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.010> when<00:02:05.130> you're<00:02:05.280> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it's easy to get mixed up when you're in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's easy to get mixed up when you're in
here<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.300> try<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.510> imagine<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.700> imaginary

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
here so I try to imagine like imaginary

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.480 
here so I try to imagine like imaginary
border<00:02:08.910> anyway<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.740> get<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> caracal

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
border anyway so I get to a caracal

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.650 
border anyway so I get to a caracal
table<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> tray<00:02:12.209> put<00:02:12.390> my<00:02:13.140> section

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
table or do a tray put my section

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.610 
table or do a tray put my section
because<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.900> board<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.170> looking<00:02:16.260> like

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
because when the board is looking like

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.110 
because when the board is looking like
this<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.920> try<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> follow<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.820> doesn't

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
this you try to follow it that doesn't

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.570 
this you try to follow it that doesn't
work<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:19.380> watch<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.950> board<00:02:20.280> yeah<00:02:20.400> don't

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
work so don't watch the board yeah don't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.430 
work so don't watch the board yeah don't
watch<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> cork<00:02:21.150> board<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.320> you're

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
watch the cork board so what you're

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
watch the cork board so what you're
saying<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> need<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> tre<00:02:23.700> flip<00:02:24.000> jump

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
saying is I need to do a tre flip jump

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.460 
saying is I need to do a tre flip jump
really<00:02:24.900> high

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
really high

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
really high
imagine<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.070> board<00:02:26.280> landed<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.120> land<00:02:27.360> on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
imagine a board landed and then land on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.030 
imagine a board landed and then land on
a<00:02:27.570> board<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.050> not<00:02:28.380> imaginary

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
a board that is not imaginary

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.470 
a board that is not imaginary
yeah<00:02:29.850> right

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
yeah right

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.390 
yeah right
that's<00:02:32.080> not<00:02:32.290> good<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.620> guys<00:02:32.830> think

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that's not good that you guys think

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's not good that you guys think
about<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.670> outcome<00:02:34.030> there's<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.780> thing<00:02:34.989> is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
about the outcome there's the thing is

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.430 
about the outcome there's the thing is
like<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.010> land<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.400> right<00:02:36.610> here<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:38.349> was

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
like if I land this right here that was

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.660 
like if I land this right here that was
