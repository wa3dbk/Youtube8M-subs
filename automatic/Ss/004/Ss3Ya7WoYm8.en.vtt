00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello guys here is the video in this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
 video I will show you how to use the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.009
 silk can be used on venturals 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.110
 and in reconstruction 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.089
 as you see a corner broken by 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.249
 very annoying because they attack i 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.590
 hair so what I do I understand the 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.210
 silk and bought it on the site in design 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 take it where you want it below vi 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.950
 will put cut links into a small square 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.870
 very small small adequate 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.420
 obviously to the breaking of the nail that 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.070
 you have to go to repair the detached 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.110
 from his film as one 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 adhesive film and place it on top 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.160
 the nail is used a lot 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.690
 especially if a part of the is broken 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 nail bed during reconstruction 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.010
 of the reconstruction you can repair it with 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.640
 silk but also useful in nails 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.800
 natural 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 obviously do not imagine that silk 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 really last a lot but can 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.610
 help to make long grow and then 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 go animate it without breaking it like 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 unfortunately it was happening in this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.820
 moment then what do I do to give him more 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 then again it takes me a while 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.469
 always glue over glue for not nails 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 there is a problem because it is studied on purpose 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.229
 precisely for the nails and I wait for that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.990
 dry with the reconstruction instead 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.960
 you can put the layer anyway 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 silk and then proceed with the normal 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.440
 routine based etc. and so on 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.119
 it can still be a useful thing 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.000
 especially that to natural nails 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 it happens to that disgorgement or that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 break to make a handling of a 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 something because you know what 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.170
 it gives you an incredible nerve 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.760
 use this system it is normal that 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 however the silk becomes transparent at 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.990
 feel anyway felt a thing in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.119
 relief therefore I advise against putting on 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 then very strong colors because you will see 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 however this thing in relief 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.880
 on the nail 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.130
 however we say that in my opinion it is useful but 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.750
 it was really comfortable when everything 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.820
 dry the dry glue what you do 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 put a normal transparent nail polish 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.650
 I always use live tech because it was 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.180
 the period of treatment in quotation marks of the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.799
 then nails after reconstruction 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.689
 used the nail tech you used 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.990
 any transparent nail polish that you 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.549
 you want this is all I hope so much 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.170
 you like it moreover if you are 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.300
 silk stews just simply 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.970
 take solvent as you remove it 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.430
 nail polish comes white 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.070
 so you can then do it again when you see 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.380
 which bothers you bothers you 6 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.450
 because this tends to get dirty a little 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.270
 the end result you see that anyway 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.790
 the nail and that lasts and risk or less than 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 take in your hair 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.030
 very annoying thing 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620
 let me know if you have used it if 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.660
 the used as you are 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.430
 if not what you want a wall I know 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.430
 launched next video hello
