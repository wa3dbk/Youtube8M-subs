one<00:00:13.440> thing<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.710> take<00:00:13.740> into<00:00:14.100> account<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.640> that

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
one thing to take into account is that

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.370 
one thing to take into account is that
bats<00:00:15.300> are<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:15.570> always<00:00:15.840> looking<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
bats are not always looking for the

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.080 
bats are not always looking for the
warmest<00:00:16.650> temperature<00:00:17.040> out<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.580> early

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
warmest temperature out there in early

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.109 
warmest temperature out there in early
fall<00:00:18.770> cooling<00:00:19.770> water<00:00:19.950> temperatures<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.610> like

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
fall cooling water temperatures are like

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
fall cooling water temperatures are like
an<00:00:21.240> invigoration<00:00:21.720> after<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.140> lot<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.740> long<00:00:22.980> hot

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
an invigoration after a lot a long hot

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.940 
an invigoration after a lot a long hot
summer<00:00:23.840> whereas<00:00:24.840> conversely<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
summer whereas conversely in the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.769 
summer whereas conversely in the
springtime<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> water<00:00:27.180> starts<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> warm

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
springtime when the water starts to warm

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.620 
springtime when the water starts to warm
up<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:29.460> fish<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.820> seek<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> warmer

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
up the fish will seek out the warmer

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.810 
up the fish will seek out the warmer
water<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:32.340> transition

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
water so think about the transition

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.369 
water so think about the transition
that's<00:00:32.940> happening<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.780> things<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.290> are

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
that's happening and the things that are

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.560 
that's happening and the things that are
going<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.650> before<00:00:35.220> you<00:00:35.309> key<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> certain

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
going on before you key in on a certain

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.330 
going on before you key in on a certain
water<00:00:36.780> temperature<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> first

water temperature one of the first
things<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.239> bait<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
things that I do is look for bait if you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.259 
things that I do is look for bait if you
can't<00:00:40.590> find<00:00:40.770> bait<00:00:41.010> fish<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:41.940> a

they're there if it's one big fish odds
are<00:01:10.259> there's<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.680> lot<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> small<00:01:11.160> fish

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
are there's not a lot of small fish

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.210 
are there's not a lot of small fish
there<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.149> could<00:01:12.300> be<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.509> trophy<00:01:12.930> hunt<00:01:13.220> take

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
there you could be on a trophy hunt take

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
there you could be on a trophy hunt take
this<00:01:14.430> small<00:01:14.759> cove<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.300> creeks<00:01:15.539> mouth<00:01:15.720> for

this small cove in this creeks mouth for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
this small cove in this creeks mouth for
example<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:17.190> would<00:01:17.310> assume<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
example you would assume that this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
influx of colder water would be warmer

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
influx of colder water would be warmer
but<00:01:23.160> with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.429> wind<00:01:23.640> blowing<00:01:23.789> down<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.569> creek

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
corner off of that point we just caught

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.589 
corner off of that point we just caught
the<00:01:34.229> nice<00:01:34.380> bass<00:01:34.649> off<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.099> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.390> anytime

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
the nice bass off of and then anytime

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.180 
the nice bass off of and then anytime
I've<00:01:36.899> got<00:01:37.050> vegetation<00:01:37.709> near<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.950> shoreline

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
I've got vegetation near the shoreline

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.699 
I've got vegetation near the shoreline
I'm<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:38.880> point<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.649> think<00:01:40.649> about

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
I'm going to point that think about

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'm going to point that think about
vegetation<00:01:41.459> is<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.849> like<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.179> insulated

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
vegetation is it has like an insulated

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:57.890 
vegetation is it has like an insulated
value<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.349> so<00:01:43.860> it'll<00:01:44.069> be<00:01:44.160> warmer<00:01:44.580> sooner

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.450 

when<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:58.930> find<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> ledges<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.159> deeper

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
when I find the ledges and the deeper
