 some things about the game and those things 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.690
 these two folders that are used that is 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 data 0-0 and profile be 0 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 to run the game they need both 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.430
 games 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.770
 because one is for the options bonds and 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.020
 another one to give it in story mode 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.860
 if not if you do not have your departure from 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.020
 game 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 the game will never work ok what 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.870
