00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 two 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.889
 has a brutal acceleration if you step on the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.490
 pedal you put first in any 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.490
 traffic light 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.140
 Daniel Thomas works with cars 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.439
 electric a fast way and 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.060
 silent move around the city the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.650
 the first time you drive a car 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.110
 electric you have a feeling 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.240
 totally different is very fun 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.590
 they are fast and maneuverable vehicles 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.990
 especially the little ones like this one 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.910
 this Berlin student works in a 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.040
 citroën car rental company 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.780
 in Berlin picks up the cars where the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.110
 they separate the clients and take them to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.000
 recharging stations when I connect it 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.130
 to the station they usually ask me what is 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.020
 that 's an electric car that you're 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.670
 doing with him how long it takes to load 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.970
 how many kilometers does he make with the batteries 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.970
 full 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.830
 in the accumulated to me 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.050
 there's another charging station there 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.930
 autonomy of this electric car is of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.930
 150 kilometers something less if it turns on 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.510
 the air conditioner this scarce radio 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.720
 continues to be the biggest problem with 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.270
 only 30% remaining battery is time 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.080
 to load this car of it is responsible 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.080
 Daniel Thomas 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.070
 a full recharge lasts between 6 and 8 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.500
 hours more or less multiseat and belongs 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.479
 to the French carmaker citroën despite 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 its little autonomy and the duration of the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.189
 load the company considers this system 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.259
 attractive for the city with one way 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 average of about 5 kilometers are the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.950
 only company that bets on a fleet 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 100% electric 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.790
 we already speak of 350 electric vehicles 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.190
 to 25 thousand euros each plus the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.409
 employees the logistics systems 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.110
 navigation reading systems 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.600
 maps the parking lot that we pay to 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 the city is a considerable sum of 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.490
 order of tens of millions of euros 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.340
 for catering companies it 's a lot 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.560
 more expensive to work with electric cars 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.440
 with the conventional 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.330
 competition is more cautious sixt the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.730
 largest car rental service 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 German has a cooperation with drive 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.630
 now of bmw w of its 800 cars 40 are 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.890
 electric do not see viable a fleet 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.280
 completely electric 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.989
 winds 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.849
 since it is too early I can 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.129
 complete the fleet and expand the 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.439
 progressively but never commit the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.569
 mistake of going completely to this 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.519
 technology to do it would scare 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 certain customers and also the network of 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.250
 Recharge stations in Berlin is still 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.520
 insufficient 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.370
 multi city has 350 cars 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.070
 Daniel Daniel Thomas does not miss 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.130
 work next year the fleet 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.350
 will increase by 150 units with more 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.640
 vehicles of this type in the city is 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.800
 necessary to review a couple of concepts of 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.810
 a corner came a cyclist who 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.840
 confident that if there was a car it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 would go but it was not like that because a car 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.850
 electric does not make noise I dodged it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.620
 the hairs almost ran over him like 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.470
 driver is necessary to keep in mind 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.470
 all the time that we do not hear you 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.970
 rent by carsharing a car 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.120
 electric like this costs 28 cents 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 per minute that the car is immaculate is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.170
 part of the service 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.090
 Daniel Thomas also takes the cars 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.340
 to the workshop where the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.379
 electronics and batteries with 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.379
 difference the most expensive component 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.510
 I'm going to see if there's something to do here 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.420
 about Daniel Thomas does not lose the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.040
 you are already looking for the next car 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.450
 that needs to be recharged very well 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.450
 we see in two hours take care
