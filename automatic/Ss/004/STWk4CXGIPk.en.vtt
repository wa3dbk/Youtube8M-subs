00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
up started chipping really fast and like

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.120 
up started chipping really fast and like
really<00:00:08.670> easily<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.380> dollar<00:00:10.800> store

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
really easily because it's dollar store

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.610 
really easily because it's dollar store
nail<00:00:11.309> polish<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.509> was<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.809> dollar<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.220 
nail polish so it was like a dollar and
it<00:00:14.429> wasn't<00:00:14.790> very<00:00:14.849> good<00:00:15.059> i<00:00:15.269> guess<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:15.990> i

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it wasn't very good i guess so i

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
it wasn't very good i guess so i
wouldn't<00:00:16.590> recommend<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.640> pretty

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
