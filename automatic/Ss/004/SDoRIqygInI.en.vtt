00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello to all of us and to my channel the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.389
 today's video is my last video in the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.010
 back-to-school series and I decided 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 dedicate it this time to the outfits in the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 today 5 outfit ideas from Monday to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 Friday how can you dress well 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 be for work for college 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 even for school if you do not have to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.320
 wear uniform then I hope you like it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.320
 a lot and let's start with the video 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.840
 It's Monday and you have experience starting 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.849
 the week then here I show you a 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.949
 outfit with which you will be able to start 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.260
 the week with the best energy in the world 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.600
 I think that getting ready to get dressed or a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.220
 little bit better helps you how to improve 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.190
 that energy and you're going to be with a 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.409
 smile all this Monday I decided for this 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.720
 outfit use a colored blouse 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.030
 peplum cream I think these lights 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.769
 many figures fit 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.510
 If you are thin as I create you volume 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.100
 and if you are a little thicker you can 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.269
 hide the part in which you 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.729
 you feel less comfortable in black pants 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.769
 basic some nude color palettes you can 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.510
 put on nude colored heels too and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.159
 I decided to give it some color to 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.810
 start the week with all the measure of 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.810
 world with a pink blazer 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.869
 i 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.890
 the second of the week I define it as 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.660
 Sophisticated and comfortable at the same time I like it 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.460
 a lot of playing with white colors and 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.830
 black but this time I gave him a twist and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.590
 then I saw more feminine with a picture of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.770
 flowers the outfit is too simple 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.260
 it's a black bag, a pair of trousers 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.570
 of whatever pattern you have in this 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.390
 case I chose one of white flowers 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.070
 and grays and some black suitcases you can 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.500
 put on some black booties you can 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.509
 put on some black heels and to 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.270
 make it more sophisticated I picked up my 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.180
 hair and I put some red lips to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 that one more tris results all the other 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.360
 for those Wednesday days in which 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.310
 I want to tell you arranged but suddenly 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.930
 and midweek we have a sad 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.210
 laziness do not worry I have you the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.400
 perfect outfit for this again 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.490
 I decided to use a bag this time a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 cream bag with khaki pants 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.500
 and some beige tennis shoes you can use 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.960
 black tennis a tennis shoes you can 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.220
 use suitcases you can wear heels you can 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.130
 wear booties boots 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.140
 everything you want seems to me to be 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.700
 very important to feel comfortable halfway 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.560
 of the week because I'm not waiting 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.030
 a lot on the weekend but I'll be 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.710
 waiting for the weekend do not give you 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.760
 excuse not to fix not to see you 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.760
 pretty every day 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.110
 Friday or Thursday or whatever you want to say 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 It's one of my favorite days and I have to 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.240
 confess that this is one of my outfits 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.770
 most used is too simple 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.200
 for those hot days ago 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.700
 cold you can make it more elegant 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.370
 you can not shelter anymore you can not go back 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.920
 more relaxed better said is my favorite 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.830
 is a simple body or a shirt of 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.320
 black strips leggings or trousers 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.200
 black a jean shirt to wear 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.209
 over and some boots like them 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.950
 ride black horses with details 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.800
 golden as they have always realized 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 I love the golden details this is 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.770
 one of my favorites because you can 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.959
 put on any shirt you can 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.970
 put on any bag and always 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.310
 you will see just as unique you can not 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.750
 wrap a 3 more by putting a sack 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.580
 under the shirt no one has given 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 account or a super large scarf 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.480
 let's say a leopard print is 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.480
 I would see very very very nice 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.349
 It's Friday and I can assure you that the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.209
 Friday is the favorite day of the week 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.890
 of all the people let me know in 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.040
 the comments which studies favorite 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.470
 for this outfit I decided something relaxed 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.540
 but feminine as always decides 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 start with a cream colored blouse or 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.040
 white color imports long sleeves 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.650
 It has some details like flowers 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.379
 It is not a fit but has as 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.269
 appearance of a lace some jeans that 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.310
 they have as they are as wide as 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.480
 Some boyfriend jeans tell them with 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.820
 the songs your jeans that are more 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.410
 wide in the boots I decided to fold them 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.380
 up and put on some tennis shoes 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.060
 golden ones that I'm given to give everything 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.700
 the look the most feminine part of the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.280
 I decided to put on a jacket 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.740
 Blue brand these jackets are super 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.710
 easy to carry bring keep 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.720
 then I think it's the best car 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.010
 to finish the week 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.990
