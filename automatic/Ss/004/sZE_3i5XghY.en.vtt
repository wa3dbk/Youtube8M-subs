we're<00:00:00.359> like<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:00.810> imaginal<00:00:01.589> cells<00:00:01.620> and<00:00:02.280> sends

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
we're like the imaginal cells and sends

we're like the imaginal cells and sends
indeed<00:00:02.879> but<00:00:03.090> once<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.629> build<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.230> new

that's<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.840> know<00:00:10.070> framing<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.490> what

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
that's you know framing that but what

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.690 
that's you know framing that but what
does<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.509> future<00:00:12.809> also<00:00:13.200> look<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.519> the

like I want to talk to that for a second

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.169 
like I want to talk to that for a second
because<00:00:28.890> that's<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> most<00:00:29.490> important<00:00:29.939> parts

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
because that's the most important parts

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
because that's the most important parts
like<00:00:30.330> where<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> hell<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.900> go<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.439> we've

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
like where the hell we go because we've

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.749 
like where the hell we go because we've
tried<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.219> things<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.640> not

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
tried all these things it's not

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
tried all these things it's not
necessarily<00:00:33.239> working<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
necessarily working and then I want to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.400

already<00:01:44.630> gone<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> if<00:01:46.219> I<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:47.030> one<00:01:47.210> minute

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
already gone and if I just in one minute

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.889 
already gone and if I just in one minute
if<00:01:47.689> I<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:48.049> comprise<00:01:49.060> what<00:01:50.060> about<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.659> economy

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
if I can comprise what about the economy

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.480 
if I can comprise what about the economy
because<00:01:51.320> that's<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.590> big<00:01:51.890> issue<00:01:52.009> we're<00:01:52.280> facing

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
because that's a big issue we're facing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.859 
because that's a big issue we're facing
well<00:01:52.789> here's<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.360> interesting<00:01:53.509> thing<00:01:53.840> about

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
well here's an interesting thing about

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.050 
well here's an interesting thing about
the<00:01:54.110> economy<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.649> body<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.549> concept<00:01:55.909> of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
the economy of the body the concept of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.880 
the economy of the body the concept of
wealth<00:01:56.329> does<00:01:56.539> not<00:01:56.780> exist<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.380> body<00:01:57.619> until

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
wealth does not exist in the body until

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.679 
wealth does not exist in the body until
every<00:01:58.310> cell<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.700> covered<00:01:59.030> with<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.240> basics

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
every cell is covered with the basics

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.200 
every cell is covered with the basics
every<00:02:00.200> cell<00:02:00.439> gets<00:02:00.679> food<00:02:00.950> shelter<00:02:01.549> protection

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
every cell gets food shelter protection

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.899 
every cell gets food shelter protection
that's<00:02:02.539> giving<00:02:03.020> once<00:02:03.829> that<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.340> reached<00:02:04.670> by<00:02:04.789> a

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
that's giving once that is reached by a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.870 
that's giving once that is reached by a
body<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.110> extra<00:02:06.649> energy<00:02:06.799> that<00:02:07.219> comes<00:02:07.369> in<00:02:07.729> is

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
body the extra energy that comes in is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.240 
body the extra energy that comes in is
the<00:02:08.629> is<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:08.989> wealth<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.769> system<00:02:10.099> it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the is the wealth of the system it's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.930 
the is the wealth of the system it's
boyan<00:02:10.519> what<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.239> basic<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:12.500> first<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.670> cells

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
boyan what was basic at first the cells

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.640 
boyan what was basic at first the cells
can<00:02:14.180> collect<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> wealth<00:02:14.870> because<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
can collect the wealth because the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.620 
can collect the wealth because the
energy<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.370> stored<00:02:16.640> as<00:02:16.819> physical<00:02:17.269> units

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
energy is stored as physical units

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.229 
energy is stored as physical units
chlorine<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.140> called<00:02:18.440> ATP<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.940> there's<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
chlorine is called ATP so there's a

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.009 
chlorine is called ATP so there's a
storage<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.989> ATP<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.069> cells<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:23.030> acquire<00:02:23.630> but

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
storage of ATP and cells can acquire but

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.930 
storage of ATP and cells can acquire but
an<00:02:24.079> interesting<00:02:24.230> not<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.190> Bill<00:02:25.400> Gates<00:02:25.430> where

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
an interesting not like Bill Gates where

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.789 
an interesting not like Bill Gates where
you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.690> much<00:02:26.720> beyond<00:02:27.319> anything<00:02:27.590> you

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
you can have so much beyond anything you

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.979 
you can have so much beyond anything you
could<00:02:27.920> ever<00:02:28.040> imagine<00:02:28.250> cells<00:02:29.180> have<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.510> physical

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
could ever imagine cells have a physical

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.559 
could ever imagine cells have a physical
limit<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.440> how<00:02:30.560> much<00:02:30.769> money<00:02:31.310> they<00:02:31.579> can<00:02:31.790> hold<00:02:32.000> so

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
limit of how much money they can hold so

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.289 
limit of how much money they can hold so
to<00:02:32.630> speak<00:02:32.920> when<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.130> limit<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.579> reached<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
to speak when that limit is reached the

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.479 
to speak when that limit is reached the
extra<00:02:35.930> money<00:02:36.079> is<00:02:36.319> put<00:02:36.500> into<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.950> community

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
extra money is put into the community

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.620 
extra money is put into the community
bank<00:02:37.700> which<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.150> happen<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.720> wonderful

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
bank which I happen to have a wonderful

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.300 
bank which I happen to have a wonderful
I<00:02:41.630> decided<00:02:42.110> against<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.620> community<00:02:43.099> bank

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
I decided against of the community bank

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.890 
I decided against of the community bank
it's<00:02:43.519> not<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.000> individuals<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.840> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
it's not for the individuals for the

it's not for the individuals for the
entire<00:02:45.200> evolution<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.920> government<00:02:46.400> didn't

entire evolution of government didn't

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.699 
entire evolution of government didn't
have<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> child<00:02:47.720> unless<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.290> bank<00:02:48.440> is

have a child unless the bank is

have a child unless the bank is

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
vision and all that you break a leg

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.309 
vision and all that you break a leg
delivered<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.190> say<00:02:55.310> what<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.609> hell

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
delivered up and say what the hell

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.289 
delivered up and say what the hell
by<00:02:56.590> why<00:02:56.829> are<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.980> taking<00:02:57.280> my<00:02:57.579> money<00:02:57.879> to<00:02:58.090> fix

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
by why are you taking my money to fix

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.770 
by why are you taking my money to fix
the<00:02:58.510> leg<00:02:58.689> so<00:02:59.650> basically<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.939> says<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.480> what<00:03:01.659> are

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
the leg so basically it says of what are

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.629 
the leg so basically it says of what are
we<00:03:01.900> doing<00:03:02.139> wrong<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.379> answer<00:03:02.590> Cisco<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.489> have

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
we doing wrong the answer Cisco we have

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.220 
we doing wrong the answer Cisco we have
a<00:03:03.670> major<00:03:03.969> portion<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.480> population<00:03:05.079> doesn't

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
a major portion of population doesn't

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.559 
a major portion of population doesn't
even<00:03:05.409> have<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> basics<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.159> life<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.420> first

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
even have a basics of life so the first

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.089 
even have a basics of life so the first
thing<00:03:07.689> is<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:08.049> how<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:08.499> say<00:03:08.799> we<00:03:09.010> have

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
thing is this how can you say we have

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.099 
thing is this how can you say we have
well<00:03:09.430> when<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.299> have<00:03:10.450> people<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.840> have

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
well when we have people that have

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.899 
well when we have people that have
nothing<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.709> yet<00:03:11.769> there's<00:03:12.340> enough<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.730> give

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
nothing and yet there's enough to give

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.699 
nothing and yet there's enough to give
them<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.209> basic<00:03:13.659> stuff<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.109> there's<00:03:14.439> enough

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
them that basic stuff and there's enough

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.459 
them that basic stuff and there's enough
for<00:03:14.920> individuals<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.659> make<00:03:16.659> a<00:03:16.689> profit<00:03:16.989> for

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469 
for individuals to make a profit for

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.140 
for individuals to make a profit for
their<00:03:17.620> own<00:03:17.650> personal<00:03:17.980> lives<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.700> there's<00:03:19.000> an

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
their own personal lives and there's an

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.970 
their own personal lives and there's an
ultra<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.629> world<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.109> make<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.290> profit<00:03:20.560> for<00:03:20.920> the

ultra the world to make a profit for the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.270 
ultra the world to make a profit for the
world<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.000> put<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.269> this<00:03:22.450> together<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:23.280> this

world and put all this together and this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.349 
world and put all this together and this
is<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.269> fundamentally<00:03:25.989> important<00:03:26.439> because

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
is so fundamentally important because

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.789 
is so fundamentally important because
there's<00:03:28.359> a<00:03:28.419> new<00:03:28.569> way<00:03:28.719> of<00:03:28.750> sharing<00:03:29.139> well<00:03:29.500> and

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
there's a new way of sharing well and

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.250 
there's a new way of sharing well and
it's<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.430> win-win-win<00:03:31.030> situation<00:03:31.269> everybody

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
it's a win-win-win situation everybody

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.080 
it's a win-win-win situation everybody
waves<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.829> situation<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.669> that's<00:03:33.790> what<00:03:34.060> a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
waves in the situation and that's what a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.390 
waves in the situation and that's what a
healthy<00:03:34.299> body<00:03:34.599> is<00:03:34.870> all<00:03:35.049> about<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.099> when<00:03:36.280> we

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
healthy body is all about so when we

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.830 
healthy body is all about so when we
look<00:03:36.519> out<00:03:36.699> on<00:03:36.939> the<00:03:37.090> app's<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.449> it<00:03:37.599> what<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
look out on the app's like it what the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.270 
look out on the app's like it what the
hell<00:03:37.959> going<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.169> do<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.349> say<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.769> answers<00:03:39.129> were

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
hell going to do I say the answers were

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.659 
hell going to do I say the answers were
to<00:03:39.489> be<00:03:39.669> done<00:03:39.939> every<00:03:40.719> technology<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:42.400> we're

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
to be done every technology that we're

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:44.819 
to be done every technology that we're
trying<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.180> do<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:44.109> cells<00:03:44.379> have<00:03:44.560> already

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
trying to do the cells have already

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.339 
trying to do the cells have already
managed<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.909> they<00:03:46.180> can<00:03:46.359> manifest<00:03:46.659> energy

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
managed it that they can manifest energy

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.740 
managed it that they can manifest energy
they<00:03:47.590> can<00:03:47.650> store<00:03:48.069> energy<00:03:48.340> they<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.849> clean<00:03:49.599> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
they can store energy they can clean the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.720 
they can store energy they can clean the
environment<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.530> mean<00:03:50.680> but<00:03:50.859> look<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.459> amazing

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
environment I mean but look the amazing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.539 
environment I mean but look the amazing
system<00:03:52.329> of<00:03:52.480> filtering<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.349> garbage<00:03:54.219> that<00:03:54.370> we

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
system of filtering the garbage that we

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.979 
system of filtering the garbage that we
live<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.060> cover<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.480> air<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:55.870> I'll

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
live in and cover the air and I'll

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.220 
live in and cover the air and I'll
laptop<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.219> filter<00:03:57.819> clean<00:03:58.269> maintain<00:03:59.109> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
laptop and the filter clean maintain the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.929 
laptop and the filter clean maintain the
temperature<00:03:59.409> and<00:03:59.799> all<00:03:59.949> that<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.699> most

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
temperature and all that and I most

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.869 
temperature and all that and I most
efficient<00:04:01.359> level<00:04:01.509> that's<00:04:02.349> why<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:02.979> don't<00:04:03.759> have

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
efficient level that's why we don't have

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.659 
efficient level that's why we don't have
to<00:04:03.970> go<00:04:04.090> look<00:04:04.329> for<00:04:04.359> how<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.989> do<00:04:05.349> it<00:04:05.530> we<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.519> have

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
to go look for how to do it we just have

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.969 
to go look for how to do it we just have
to<00:04:06.699> look<00:04:07.000> at<00:04:07.180> those<00:04:07.479> set<00:04:07.689> of<00:04:07.720> work<00:04:07.959> on<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:08.530> and

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
to look at those set of work on it and

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.419 
to look at those set of work on it and
then<00:04:09.250> they<00:04:09.310> make<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.669> pattern<00:04:09.909> from<00:04:10.180> that
