such a big car the way you can throw it
into<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.310> corner<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.850> in<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.210> grips<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.870> goes

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
into a corner and in just grips and goes

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.690 
into a corner and in just grips and goes
and<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:11.550> lack<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.880> body<00:04:12.330> roll<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:13.700> fantastic

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
and the lack of body roll is fantastic

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.259 
and the lack of body roll is fantastic
it<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.799> is<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.280> almost<00:04:17.609> boggles<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
it is so is it it almost boggles the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.229 
it is so is it it almost boggles the
mind<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.720> think<00:04:18.840> with<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.200> amount<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.590> mass

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
mind you think with this amount of mass

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.360 
mind you think with this amount of mass
being<00:04:21.239> thrown<00:04:21.660> around<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.830> there<00:04:23.010> should<00:04:23.220> be

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
being thrown around that there should be

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.250 
being thrown around that there should be
a<00:04:23.400> lot<00:04:23.550> of<00:04:23.580> lateral<00:04:24.180> motion<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.840> should<00:04:25.110> be

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
a lot of lateral motion there should be

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.830 
a lot of lateral motion there should be
some<00:04:25.500> understeer<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.670> it<00:04:27.090> does<00:04:27.360> very<00:04:27.750> very

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
some understeer but it does very very

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.230 
some understeer but it does very very
well<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.650> keep<00:04:28.830> everything<00:04:29.220> under<00:04:29.850> control

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
well to keep everything under control

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.170 
well to keep everything under control
and<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.500> what<00:04:32.160> has<00:04:32.370> sold<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.820> lot<00:04:32.940> less

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and that is what has sold a lot less

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.959 
and that is what has sold a lot less
bags<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.660> people<00:04:34.020> because<00:04:34.230> usually<00:04:35.150> you<00:04:36.150> have

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
bags to people because usually you have

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:39.969 
bags to people because usually you have
people<00:04:38.329> carry<00:04:38.569> you<00:04:38.779> sort<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.259> have<00:04:39.439> to<00:04:39.589> put<00:04:39.799> up

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
people carry you sort of have to put up

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.919 
people carry you sort of have to put up
with<00:04:40.009> the<00:04:40.369> fact<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.729> it's<00:04:40.969> not<00:04:41.269> going<00:04:41.809> to<00:04:41.869> be

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:44.229 
with the fact that it's not going to be
the<00:04:42.049> best<00:04:42.229> handling<00:04:42.649> car<00:04:42.979> but<00:04:43.669> I<00:04:43.789> supposed<00:04:44.089> you
