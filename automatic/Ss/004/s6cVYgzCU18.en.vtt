vehicles like Oh a Ford Ranger or a
Honda<00:00:28.700> Civic<00:00:28.850> it<00:00:29.540> can<00:00:29.689> be<00:00:29.810> very<00:00:30.050> difficult<00:00:30.320> to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
Honda Civic it can be very difficult to

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.130 
Honda Civic it can be very difficult to
get<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:30.920> air<00:00:31.160> out<00:00:31.490> of<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.730> line<00:00:31.939> sometimes<00:00:32.599> so

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
get the air out of the line sometimes so

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.570 
get the air out of the line sometimes so
we're<00:00:33.350> going<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.530> take<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:33.680> look<00:00:33.950> at<00:00:34.100> how<00:00:34.309> that

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
we're going to take a look at how that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.640 
we're going to take a look at how that
air<00:00:34.820> gets<00:00:35.120> into<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.510> hydraulic<00:00:36.140> lines<00:00:36.379> and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
air gets into the hydraulic lines and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.410 
air gets into the hydraulic lines and
the<00:00:36.739> best<00:00:36.949> way<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:37.160> get<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:37.520> out<00:00:37.670> let's<00:00:38.239> get

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
the best way to get it out let's get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.150 
the best way to get it out let's get
started<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.590> course<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:39.860> can't<00:00:40.040> really

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
started and of course we can't really

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.070 
started and of course we can't really
see<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.550> air<00:00:40.699> bubble<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.330> line<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:41.870> here's

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
see the air bubble in the line so here's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.810 
see the air bubble in the line so here's
a<00:00:42.140> great<00:00:42.440> little<00:00:42.770> display<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.430> will<00:00:43.520> help<00:00:43.670> us

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
a great little display that will help us

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.420 
a great little display that will help us
understand<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.110> Gary<00:00:45.470> I<00:00:45.590> guess<00:00:46.220> here's

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
understand that so Gary I guess here's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.860 
understand that so Gary I guess here's
the<00:00:46.550> air<00:00:46.670> bubble<00:00:47.090> what<00:00:47.270> else<00:00:47.420> is<00:00:47.540> going<00:00:47.780> on

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
the air bubble what else is going on

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.250 
the air bubble what else is going on

have<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.970> air<00:00:56.059> bubble<00:00:56.330> in<00:00:56.390> this<00:00:56.510> system<00:00:56.720> so

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
have the air bubble in this system so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.960 
have the air bubble in this system so
when<00:00:57.229> I<00:00:57.350> push<00:00:57.589> on<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.860> clutch<00:00:58.100> pedal<00:00:58.400> the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
when I push on the clutch pedal the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.100 
when I push on the clutch pedal the
pressure<00:00:59.239> plate<00:00:59.540> is<00:00:59.629> going<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.839> allow<00:01:00.050> the

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
pressure plate is going to allow the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.799 
pressure plate is going to allow the
disc<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.710> spin<00:01:00.949> down<00:01:01.159> freely<00:01:01.519> shifts<00:01:02.420> normally

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
disc to spin down freely shifts normally

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.750 
disc to spin down freely shifts normally
the<00:01:02.930> way<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.140> should<00:01:03.379> bring<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.100> pedal<00:01:04.370> up<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
the way it should bring the pedal up the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.940 
the way it should bring the pedal up the
clutch<00:01:05.000> engages<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:06.140> let's<00:01:06.320> add<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.560> air

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
clutch engages now let's add the air

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.130 
clutch engages now let's add the air
bubble<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.700> when<00:01:07.850> I<00:01:07.940> open<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:08.360> valve<00:01:08.659> we're

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
bubble so when I open this valve we're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.420 
bubble so when I open this valve we're
going<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.350> add<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.770> air<00:01:09.950> bubble<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.310> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
going to add this air bubble to the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.030 
going to add this air bubble to the
system<00:01:10.850> it'll<00:01:11.600> compress<00:01:12.020> first<00:01:12.500> Wow<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
system it'll compress first Wow the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.219 
system it'll compress first Wow the
fluid<00:01:13.640> is<00:01:13.760> compressing<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.600> air<00:01:14.720> bubble<00:01:15.110> that

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
fluid is compressing the air bubble that

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.910 
fluid is compressing the air bubble that
gives<00:01:15.470> us<00:01:15.590> fine<00:01:16.220> GL<00:01:16.850> we<00:01:17.510> lose<00:01:17.780> pedal<00:01:18.200> travel<00:01:18.619> we

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
gives us fine GL we lose pedal travel we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.399 
gives us fine GL we lose pedal travel we
lose<00:01:19.190> plate<00:01:19.760> lift<00:01:20.119> on<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.510> clutch<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.990> we

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
lose plate lift on the clutch and we

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.860 
lose plate lift on the clutch and we
don't<00:01:21.650> get<00:01:21.830> a<00:01:21.890> clean<00:01:22.310> clutch<00:01:22.700> release<00:01:23.000> we're

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
don't get a clean clutch release we're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.800 
don't get a clean clutch release we're

the line but on the vehicle where does
it<00:01:40.220> come<00:01:40.430> from<00:01:40.640> Jim<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.240> find<00:01:41.510> it's<00:01:41.660> almost

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
it come from Jim we find it's almost

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.050 
it come from Jim we find it's almost
always<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.650> trapped<00:01:43.100> air<00:01:43.340> bubble<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
always a trapped air bubble in the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.680 
bubble is up there it's not going to go
out<00:01:51.620> down<00:01:51.890> through<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.250> line<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.150> we<00:01:53.330> teach<00:01:53.540> a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
out down through the line so we teach a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.900 
out down through the line so we teach a
technique<00:01:54.110> where<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.010> tip<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.490> master

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
technique where you tip the master

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.700 
technique where you tip the master
cylinder<00:01:56.150> so<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> bubble<00:01:57.110> can<00:01:57.230> actually<00:01:57.590> go

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
cylinder so the bubble can actually go

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.830 
cylinder so the bubble can actually go
back<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.250> top<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:59.120> is<00:01:59.300> done<00:01:59.450> off<00:01:59.660> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
back out the top this is done off the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.990 
back out the top this is done off the
vehicle<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.409> bench<00:02:00.680> no<00:02:01.280> special<00:02:01.760> tools

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
vehicle on the bench no special tools

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.630 
vehicle on the bench no special tools
required<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.200> feel<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.950> change<00:02:04.340> in

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
required and you can feel the change in

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.340 
required and you can feel the change in
your<00:02:04.790> own<00:02:04.850> hands<00:02:05.450> when<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.080> ready<00:02:06.290> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
your own hands when it's ready to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.529 
your own hands when it's ready to
reinstall<00:02:06.680> well<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.730> makes<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.030> lot<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.209> sense

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
reinstall well that makes a lot of sense

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.300 
reinstall well that makes a lot of sense
so<00:02:08.780> let's<00:02:09.050> go<00:02:09.200> back<00:02:09.409> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.619> vehicle<00:02:09.950> here<00:02:10.129> and

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
so let's go back to the vehicle here and

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.210 
so let's go back to the vehicle here and
check<00:02:10.519> it<00:02:10.550> out<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:11.000> well<00:02:11.900> Gary<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.409> f150

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
check it out there well Gary this f150

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.130 
check it out there well Gary this f150
has<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.430> similar<00:02:13.879> problem<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.510> Ranger<00:02:15.019> that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
has a similar problem to the Ranger that

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.040 
has a similar problem to the Ranger that
we<00:02:15.260> were<00:02:15.379> talking<00:02:15.709> about<00:02:15.800> yes<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.790> clutch<00:02:17.720> has

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
we were talking about yes the clutch has

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.020 
we were talking about yes the clutch has
been<00:02:18.260> installed<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:19.159> it<00:02:19.340> has<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> soft<00:02:19.790> pedal

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
been installed but it has a soft pedal

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.080 
been installed but it has a soft pedal
so<00:02:20.420> what's<00:02:21.200> different<00:02:21.379> though<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.400> clutch

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so what's different though is the clutch

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.629 
so what's different though is the clutch
master<00:02:23.300> cylinder<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:23.930> horizontal<00:02:24.739> not<00:02:25.280> tip

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639 
master cylinder is horizontal not tip

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.489 
master cylinder is horizontal not tip
does<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:25.909> make<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> difference<00:02:26.209> a<00:02:26.599> little<00:02:27.349> bit

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:27.499 
does that make a difference a little bit

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.610 
does that make a difference a little bit
they<00:02:28.189> have<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.700> same<00:02:28.939> internal<00:02:29.599> design<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
they have the same internal design the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.899 
they have the same internal design the
Ford<00:02:30.889> Ranger<00:02:31.129> it's<00:02:31.459> tipped<00:02:31.730> pretty

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
Ford Ranger it's tipped pretty

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.399 
Ford Ranger it's tipped pretty
dramatically<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.629> air<00:02:32.749> bubble<00:02:33.019> is<00:02:33.079> really

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
dramatically the air bubble is really

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.649 
dramatically the air bubble is really
trapped<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.859> here<00:02:34.099> this<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.969> looks<00:02:35.299> like<00:02:35.450> it

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
trapped up here this one looks like it

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:36.670 
trapped up here this one looks like it
shouldn't<00:02:35.900> be<00:02:35.989> a<00:02:36.049> problem

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
shouldn't be a problem

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.099 
shouldn't be a problem
but<00:02:37.010> even<00:02:37.310> horizontal<00:02:37.969> the<00:02:38.540> air<00:02:38.719> bubble<00:02:38.989> is

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
but even horizontal the air bubble is

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.319 
but even horizontal the air bubble is
still<00:02:39.379> trapped<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.310> top<00:02:40.579> half<00:02:40.969> of<00:02:41.180> the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
still trapped in the top half of the

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.759 
still trapped in the top half of the
pressure<00:02:41.629> chamber<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.349> master<00:02:42.680> cylinder

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
pressure chamber of the master cylinder

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.670 
pressure chamber of the master cylinder
bore<00:02:43.129> so<00:02:43.849> to<00:02:43.909> get<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.209> out<00:02:44.359> we<00:02:44.930> have<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.290> take<00:02:45.530> it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
bore so to get it out we have to take it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.640 
bore so to get it out we have to take it
off<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.920> chassis<00:02:46.159> tip<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.879> will<00:02:47.659> exercise<00:02:48.409> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
off the chassis tip it will exercise the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.190 
off the chassis tip it will exercise the
push<00:02:48.859> rod<00:02:49.129> back<00:02:49.370> here<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.749> valve<00:02:50.989> will

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
push rod back here and the valve will

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.530 
push rod back here and the valve will
open<00:02:51.319> close<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.849> bubbles<00:02:53.150> will<00:02:53.299> come<00:02:53.420> out

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
open close and the bubbles will come out

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.629 
open close and the bubbles will come out
the<00:02:53.719> top<00:02:53.989> of<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.439> reservoir<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
the top of the reservoir if the

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.009 
the top of the reservoir if the
instructions<00:02:56.150> were<00:02:56.269> followed<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.719> we<00:02:56.840> offer

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
instructions were followed that we offer

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.470 
instructions were followed that we offer
we<00:02:57.680> wouldn't<00:02:57.980> have<00:02:58.129> this<00:02:58.279> problem<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:58.879> we

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
we wouldn't have this problem and we

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.509 
we wouldn't have this problem and we
would<00:02:59.629> get<00:02:59.779> it<00:02:59.930> bled<00:03:00.560> out<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.099> bench

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
would get it bled out on the bench

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.550 
would get it bled out on the bench
before<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.120> install<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.689> then<00:03:03.049> finish<00:03:03.290> for

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
before we install it and then finish for

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.050 
before we install it and then finish for
the<00:03:03.620> gravity<00:03:03.980> bleed<00:03:04.189> it's<00:03:04.670> not<00:03:04.849> such<00:03:05.029> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the gravity bleed it's not such a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.879 
the gravity bleed it's not such a
problem<00:03:05.359> after<00:03:05.599> all<00:03:05.840> right<00:03:06.379> well<00:03:06.560> show<00:03:06.709> us<00:03:06.799> how

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
problem after all right well show us how

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:07.209 
problem after all right well show us how
it's<00:03:07.040> done

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
it's done

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.489 
it's done
okay<00:03:07.909> tell<00:03:08.239> us<00:03:08.329> what<00:03:08.510> has<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.779> be<00:03:08.900> removed<00:03:09.319> for

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:09.499 
okay tell us what has to be removed for

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.619 
okay tell us what has to be removed for
a<00:03:09.590> procedure<00:03:09.920> like<00:03:10.279> this<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:11.120> vehicle<00:03:11.569> we

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
a procedure like this this vehicle we

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:12.640 
a procedure like this this vehicle we
had<00:03:11.719> to<00:03:11.779> remove<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.109> master<00:03:12.469> cylinder

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
had to remove the master cylinder

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.979 
had to remove the master cylinder
reservoir<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.609> master<00:03:13.999> cylinder<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
reservoir the master cylinder and the

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.289 
reservoir the master cylinder and the
pressure<00:03:15.260> line<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:16.340> allows<00:03:16.639> us<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:16.969> take<00:03:17.150> it

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
pressure line this allows us to take it

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.809 
pressure line this allows us to take it
to<00:03:17.480> some<00:03:17.989> object<00:03:18.319> a<00:03:18.829> ladder<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.279> stand<00:03:19.609> like

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
to some object a ladder a stand like

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:20.229 
to some object a ladder a stand like
this

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
this

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.360 
this
we<00:03:20.689> stretch<00:03:20.989> it<00:03:21.139> out<00:03:21.230> reservoir<00:03:21.980> at<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.099> top

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
we stretch it out reservoir at the top

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.360 
we stretch it out reservoir at the top
master<00:03:23.359> cylinder<00:03:23.749> very<00:03:24.499> important<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.219> it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
master cylinder very important that it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.030

okay<00:04:02.329> careful<00:04:02.599> sir<00:04:03.700> all<00:04:04.700> I'm<00:04:04.819> going<00:04:04.909> to<00:04:05.029> do<00:04:05.150> is

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
okay careful sir all I'm going to do is

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.250 
okay careful sir all I'm going to do is
exercise<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.709> push<00:04:06.919> rod<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.370> little<00:04:07.700> bit<00:04:07.879> and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
exercise the push rod a little bit and

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.039 
exercise the push rod a little bit and
that<00:04:09.260> valve<00:04:10.419> triggers<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:11.540> bubbles<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.930> come

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
that valve triggers the bubbles to come

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.280 
that valve triggers the bubbles to come
out<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.290> top<00:04:12.499> coming<00:04:12.919> out<00:04:13.129> already<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:15.109> the

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
out the top coming out already so the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.140 
out the top coming out already so the
further<00:04:15.499> the<00:04:15.709> push<00:04:15.889> rod<00:04:16.130> pushes<00:04:16.609> that's<00:04:16.880> more

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
further the push rod pushes that's more

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.210 
further the push rod pushes that's more
air<00:04:17.359> when<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.079> tightens<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:18.889> gets<00:04:19.070> to

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
air when it tightens up and gets to

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.370 
air when it tightens up and gets to
about<00:04:19.370> 1/8<00:04:19.699> of<00:04:19.730> an<00:04:19.970> inch<00:04:20.060> that's<00:04:20.989> when<00:04:21.199> we<00:04:21.260> get

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
about 1/8 of an inch that's when we get

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.140 
about 1/8 of an inch that's when we get
to<00:04:21.440> reinstall<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.190> finish<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.120> a
