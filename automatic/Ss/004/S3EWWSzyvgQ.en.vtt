to take a lot of effort a lot of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
to take a lot of effort a lot of
togetherness

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
togetherness

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700 
togetherness
from<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.300> order<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.440> continue

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
from now on in order to do to continue

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
from now on in order to do to continue
to<00:01:04.920> play<00:01:05.100> well<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.690> take

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to play well and just going to take

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
to play well and just going to take
effort<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.970> readjusting<00:01:08.970> couple<00:01:09.270> things

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
effort and readjusting couple things

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
effort and readjusting couple things
probably<00:01:09.740> because<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> movies<00:01:12.409> with<00:01:13.409> him<00:01:13.619> on

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
probably because the movies with him on

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
probably because the movies with him on
the<00:01:13.830> floor<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.220> him<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.940> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> floor<00:01:15.360> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the floor with him not on the floor and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.149 
the floor with him not on the floor and
I<00:01:15.780> mean<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.320> play<00:01:16.979> differently<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:19.159> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I mean we would play differently so so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.830 
I mean we would play differently so so
we'll<00:01:20.310> figure<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.570> long<00:01:21.720> as

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
we'll figure it out this was as long as

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.899 
we'll figure it out this was as long as
we<00:01:21.960> put<00:01:22.140> our<00:01:22.290> minds<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.649> again<00:01:23.399> in<00:01:23.490> our<00:01:23.580> hearts

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
we put our minds in again in our hearts

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
we put our minds in again in our hearts
and<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.659> fight<00:01:24.990> us<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.440> we<00:01:25.590> fought<00:01:25.800> tonight

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and we fight us as we fought tonight

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
and we fight us as we fought tonight
until<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.270> end<00:01:27.360> every<00:01:27.720> every<00:01:28.050> single

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
until the very end every every single

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
until the very end every every single
minute<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.670> should<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> okay<00:01:30.300> better

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
minute a little we should be okay better

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
minute a little we should be okay better
having<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:31.229> now<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.649> just<00:01:32.119> it's<00:01:33.119> just

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
having right now it's just it's just

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.779 
having right now it's just it's just
difficult<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.840> digest<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.770> happened<00:01:35.160> he's

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
difficult to digest what happened he's

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.249 
difficult to digest what happened he's
been<00:01:35.910> pretty<00:01:36.090> indestructible<00:01:36.509> since<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> two

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
been pretty indestructible since you two

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.630 
been pretty indestructible since you two
have<00:01:37.289> been<00:01:37.470> together<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.130> weird<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
have been together and weird for you to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
have been together and weird for you to
see<00:01:38.910> him<00:01:38.940> go<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.539> with<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:39.990> injury<00:01:40.080> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
see him go down with an injury that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.400 
see him go down with an injury that
could<00:01:40.440> keep<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.679> out<00:01:40.800> for<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> year<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:43.229> hard

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
could keep them out for a year it's hard

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.540 
could keep them out for a year it's hard
for<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.800> hard<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.100> me<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.399> him<00:01:44.520> like

for me it's hard for me to see him like

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.900 
for me it's hard for me to see him like
that<00:01:45.800> no<00:01:46.800> he<00:01:47.520> doesn't<00:01:47.850> deserve<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:50.789> is

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
that no he doesn't deserve it but it is

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.700 
that no he doesn't deserve it but it is
what<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.240> unfortunately<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.410> part<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
what it is unfortunately it is part of
