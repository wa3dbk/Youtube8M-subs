about 55 bucks I think and for the price
I'd<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> better<00:00:34.350> quality<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.160> for

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
waiting for the other side to glue set

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
waiting for the other side to glue set
the<00:01:17.070> glue<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.310> set<00:01:17.670> before<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.570> to

jig you got your tires mounted you can

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
jig you got your tires mounted you can
ignore<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.790> side<00:02:00.060> glued

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
ignore that I have one side glued

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.270 
ignore that I have one side glued
because<00:02:00.780> they're<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> be<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
because they're just going to be on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
because they're just going to be on
there<00:02:02.460> dry<00:02:02.790> fitted<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.439> do

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
there dry fitted when you go in and do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.089 
there dry fitted when you go in and do
your<00:02:04.829> your<00:02:05.219> first<00:02:05.490> side<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.960> always<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.009> do

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
your your first side I always like to do

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.499 
your your first side I always like to do
the<00:02:08.220> back<00:02:08.399> first<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.360> always

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the back first because I don't always

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.270 
the back first because I don't always
have<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> steady<00:02:10.080> hand<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.770> figure<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
have a steady hand and I figure if I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.600 
have a steady hand and I figure if I
screw<00:02:11.550> anything<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> back

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
screw anything up it's on the back

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.980 
screw anything up it's on the back
so<00:02:14.610> we'll<00:02:14.940> go<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.270> front<00:02:15.510> side<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> I'll

so close it now you can see my camera

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.030 
so close it now you can see my camera
will<00:02:55.440> focus<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:57.030> see<00:02:57.710> how<00:02:58.710> it<00:02:58.890> actually

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
will focus you can see how it actually

the rim all the way around it

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.010 
the rim all the way around it
might<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.780> hard<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.020> see<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.230> video<00:03:10.560> with<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
might be hard to see on video with the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.320 
might be hard to see on video with the
tire<00:03:13.020> being<00:03:13.320> black<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> jig<00:03:14.130> but<00:03:14.280> but<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
rubber is peeled back there you go you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.320 
rubber is peeled back there you go you
can<00:03:17.490> see<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.760> better<00:03:18.000> like<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:20.210> now<00:03:21.210> you're

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
can see it better like that now you're
