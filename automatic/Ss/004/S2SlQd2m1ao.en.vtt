00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.800
 do not 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.220
 in black 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.680
 doing a little while you want to know a little 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.510
 the history of thought to give is how they should 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.050
 climb people with this 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.050
 d 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 no no 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.750
 fasten your belt and let's justine 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.750
 very fast and we go medium light 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.690
 You can see how it was time to be 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 Peugeot official driver how was the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.470
 situation and that I felt that at the time 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 It was a pleasant surprise Augustine because I 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.430
 in the year 73 something Argentine champion 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.910
 formula one 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.980
 and I'm going to run to the USA two years when 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.500
 we see did not have did not have car for 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.660
 get on and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.750
 and well the people of Peugeot offered me 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.730
 run a race a race and that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 stay after that race stay in the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.080
 official team and I was like six or seven 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.080
 years we had a very good relationship 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.030
 subject of minutes 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.980
 I know they were real winners they were 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.980
 true gallants like eating 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.130
 I was twenty years old when I was very young 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.409
 but I think the student every time 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.149
 always there are always pretty girls 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.149
 of winning in the games is followed but 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.149
 quiet 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.700
 because there's quite the next one was 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.560
 pretty hard to run 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.989
 in those years you know that question 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 I have my sites excellence for pilots 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.760
 bigger than me and the adrenaline is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.880
 We've had everything, I think that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.069
 half an hour 15 minutes before leaving 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.550
 I do not know if it happens to them sometimes 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.550
 we find 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.810
 yes 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.460
 I hate the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.170
 and good, waiting for me to be free 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.079
 gender 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.379

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.310
