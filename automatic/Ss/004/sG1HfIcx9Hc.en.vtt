redstone<00:00:07.230> for<00:00:07.620> dummies<00:00:08.240> this<00:00:09.240> episode<00:00:09.450> is

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
redstone for dummies this episode is

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.799 
redstone for dummies this episode is
what<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.500> redstone<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.429> does<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> work<00:00:11.910> so

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
what is redstone and how does it work so

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.680 
what is redstone and how does it work so
redstone<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.490> single<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.299> actually

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
redstone is the single this actually

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.349 
redstone is the single this actually
some<00:00:15.870> redstone<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
some redstone this is what this is the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.960 
some redstone this is what this is the
redstone<00:00:18.779> block<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.949> whatever<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> want

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
redstone block or or whatever you want

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.130 
redstone block or or whatever you want
to<00:00:21.029> call<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.869> four<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> five

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to call it and you can get four to five

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
to call it and you can get four to five
redstone<00:00:25.590> out<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.949> behavior<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
redstone out of this behavior with the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.689 
redstone out of this behavior with the
iron<00:00:27.449> pickaxe<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.140> higher<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.460> see

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
iron pickaxe or higher as you can see

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.830 
iron pickaxe or higher as you can see
just<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.420> five<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:32.399> yeah<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
just got five out of it and yeah so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.830 
just got five out of it and yeah so
redstone<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.030> if<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
redstone is if you want to think of it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.319 
redstone is if you want to think of it
in<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> way<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.890> basically<00:00:38.329> electricity

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
in a way it is all basically electricity

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.670 
in a way it is all basically electricity
it<00:00:39.899> holds<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.590> currents<00:00:41.100> either<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.940> off

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
it holds two currents either on off

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
it holds two currents either on off
we're<00:00:43.680> off<00:00:43.890> isn't<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> current<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we're off isn't really a current but you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
we're off isn't really a current but you
get<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> basic<00:00:46.620> gist<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.390> those<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
get the basic gist and for those of you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.619 
get the basic gist and for those of you
that<00:00:48.989> understand<00:00:49.530> binary<00:00:50.059> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that understand binary which is the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
that understand binary which is the
computers<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> telling<00:00:52.860> something<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
computers way of telling something is on

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
computers way of telling something is on
or<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.390> zero<00:00:54.719> that's<00:00:55.620> basically

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
or off one or zero that's basically

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.709 
or off one or zero that's basically
using<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.090> method<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.039> off<00:00:59.309> is

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
using this method on is one and off is

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.740 
using this method on is one and off is
zero<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.430> computer<00:01:02.879> works<00:01:03.059> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
zero so that's our computer works so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.830 
zero so that's our computer works so
redstone<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:05.220> only<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.790> placed<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:08.840> basically

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
redstone can only be placed on basically

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.560 
redstone can only be placed on basically
anything<00:01:10.200> other<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:11.750> glass<00:01:13.070> chests<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
anything other than glass chests and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070 
anything other than glass chests and
things<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.750> store<00:01:16.229> items<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.360> i'm<00:01:18.360> pretty

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
things that store items but i'm pretty

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.570 
things that store items but i'm pretty
sure<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.920> placed<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.580> top<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.970> no<00:01:21.119> blocks

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
sure can be placed on top of no blocks

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.800 
sure can be placed on top of no blocks
that's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.909> thing<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.330> i'm<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.450> too

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that's the only thing that i'm not too

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.340 
that's the only thing that i'm not too
sure<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.920> redstone<00:01:26.549> torches<00:01:26.960> give<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
sure about so redstone torches give a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.330 
sure about so redstone torches give a
current<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
current to

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.419 
current to
at<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.060> red<00:01:31.210> stone<00:01:31.450> which<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.960> everlasting<00:01:32.429> up

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
at the red stone which is everlasting up

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.749 
at the red stone which is everlasting up
to<00:01:33.820> 15<00:01:34.240> blocks<00:01:34.509> and<00:01:35.070> we'll<00:01:36.070> learn<00:01:36.189> about<00:01:36.250> any

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
to 15 blocks and we'll learn about any

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.410 
to 15 blocks and we'll learn about any
true<00:01:37.890> inverting<00:01:38.890> later<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:39.700> at<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.299> moment

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
true inverting later but at the moment

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.179 
true inverting later but at the moment
just<00:01:40.780> think<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.109> as<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.409> always<00:01:41.590> gives

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
just think of it as it always gives

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.059 
just think of it as it always gives
currents<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.299> if<00:01:43.359> i<00:01:43.450> take<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.840> away<00:01:44.069> it'll

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
currents so if i take that away it'll

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.609 
currents so if i take that away it'll
close<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.460> door<00:01:45.670> for<00:01:46.240> put<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.479> back<00:01:46.630> it'll

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
close the door for put it back it'll

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.370 
close the door for put it back it'll
open<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.979> book<00:01:48.569> there<00:01:49.569> are<00:01:49.689> pressure<00:01:50.049> plates

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
open the book there are pressure plates

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.309 
open the book there are pressure plates
this<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> stone<00:01:51.490> pressure<00:01:51.789> plate<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.329> will

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
this is a stone pressure plate and will

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.099 
this is a stone pressure plate and will
only<00:01:53.350> affect<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:54.189> door<00:01:54.429> or<00:01:55.390> whatever<00:01:56.049> they

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
only affect the door or whatever they

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.080 
only affect the door or whatever they
have<00:01:56.289> at<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> end<00:01:56.799> if<00:01:57.039> you<00:01:57.069> stand<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:57.759> it<00:01:57.909> or<00:01:58.060> a

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
have at the end if you stand on it or a

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.859 
have at the end if you stand on it or a
mob<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.959> animal<00:01:59.530> stands<00:01:59.920> on<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.569> a<00:02:01.569> wooden

mob or animal stands on it and a wooden

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.569 
mob or animal stands on it and a wooden
pressure<00:02:02.200> plate<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.619> exactly<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.399> same

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
pressure plate is exactly the same

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.389 
pressure plate is exactly the same
except<00:02:04.060> if<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.420> throw<00:02:04.750> an<00:02:04.869> item<00:02:05.259> on<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.590> it

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
except if you throw an item on it it

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.359 
except if you throw an item on it it
will<00:02:06.479> open<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.750> door<00:02:07.929> whereas<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.860> stone<00:02:09.160> one

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
will open the door whereas the stone one

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.470 
will open the door whereas the stone one
doesn't<00:02:09.759> now<00:02:10.720> onto<00:02:11.400> pressure<00:02:12.400> plate<00:02:12.700> not

close it like that yeah as you can see

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.590 
close it like that yeah as you can see
here<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.540> Redstone<00:02:38.350> can<00:02:38.709> only<00:02:38.920> go<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:40.120> 15

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
apart from where was originally given

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.949 
apart from where was originally given
the<00:02:45.659> current<00:02:46.159> but<00:02:47.159> with<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.269> repeater<00:02:48.659> which

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the current but with the repeater which

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.039 
the current but with the repeater which
we<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:49.709> learn<00:02:49.920> about<00:02:50.099> soon<00:02:50.610> hopefully<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.810> can

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
we will learn about soon hopefully I can

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.520 
we will learn about soon hopefully I can
get<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.790> yeah<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:54.269> will<00:02:54.390> farm<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:55.349> will

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
get to it yeah we will farm it will

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.860 
get to it yeah we will farm it will
continue<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.250> current<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.760> will<00:02:57.510> open<00:02:57.840> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
continue the current and will open that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.479 
continue the current and will open that
door<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:59.250> before<00:02:59.810> for<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.920> people<00:03:01.950> who

door but before for all you people who

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.210 
door but before for all you people who
played<00:03:02.849> Minecraft<00:03:03.540> without<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.220> repeaters

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
played Minecraft without the repeaters

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.240 
played Minecraft without the repeaters
this<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.970> how<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:07.079> is<00:03:07.260> one<00:03:07.440> way<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.950> used

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
this is how this is one way that we used

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.330 
this is how this is one way that we used
to<00:03:08.510> continue<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.629> current<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.799> would<00:03:10.980> just<00:03:11.099> be

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
to continue the current it would just be

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.530 
to continue the current it would just be

lakhs and a block and another and a
repeater<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:20.730> would<00:03:20.910> actually<00:03:21.150> power

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
repeater and that would actually power

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.470 
repeater and that would actually power
this<00:03:22.319> on<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.910> offer<00:03:24.060> has<00:03:24.299> no

will<00:03:26.940> continue<00:03:27.090> on<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:29.329> because

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
will continue on to this and because

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.990 
will continue on to this and because
that<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> powered<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.470> turns<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.040> block<00:03:32.760> on

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that is powered it turns this block on

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.599 
that is powered it turns this block on
which<00:03:33.840> will<00:03:34.019> turn<00:03:34.200> everything<00:03:34.980> else<00:03:35.340> that's

redstone<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.060> our<00:04:10.050> Peter<00:04:10.410> actually

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
redstone and our Peter actually

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.809 
redstone and our Peter actually
continues<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.150> signal<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.110> we<00:04:14.010> do<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.489> but<00:04:14.730> it

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
continues a signal so we do that but it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.300 
continues a signal so we do that but it
will<00:04:15.180> only<00:04:15.239> go<00:04:15.569> out<00:04:15.600> through<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.799> front<00:04:17.010> way

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
will only go out through the front way

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.909 
will only go out through the front way
you<00:04:17.970> cannot<00:04:18.239> put<00:04:18.389> any<00:04:18.570> other<00:04:18.840> way<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:19.470> if<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.739> do

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
you cannot put any other way so if we do

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.880 
you cannot put any other way so if we do
that<00:04:19.950> we'll<00:04:20.609> continue<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.680> great

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
that we'll continue on but the great

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.290 
that we'll continue on but the great
thing<00:04:22.919> about<00:04:23.160> repeaters<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.120> can

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
thing about repeaters is that you can

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.070 
thing about repeaters is that you can
set<00:04:24.510> delays<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:26.540> current<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.780> if<00:04:27.900> we

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
set delays on to the current so if we

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.840 
set delays on to the current so if we
set<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.940> will<00:04:30.090> take<00:04:30.300> three<00:04:31.290> texts<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.980> tick

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
set that it will take three texts a tick

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.670 
set that it will take three texts a tick
is<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.120> tenth<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.780> second<00:04:34.140> i'm<00:04:34.230> pretty<00:04:34.440> sure

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
is a tenth of a second i'm pretty sure

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.790 
is a tenth of a second i'm pretty sure
and<00:04:35.250> still<00:04:35.490> debate<00:04:35.820> about<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:37.680> know

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.430 
wrong but as what I'm sure what I'm
pretty<00:04:44.580> sure<00:04:44.729> of<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.240> it's<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.930> tenth<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.320> a

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
pretty sure of it is it's a tenth of a

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.950 
pretty sure of it is it's a tenth of a
second<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:48.000> three<00:04:48.330> two<00:04:48.510> tix<00:04:48.690> will<00:04:48.870> be

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
second and so three two tix will be

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.740 
second and so three two tix will be
three<00:04:49.320> tenths<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.830> second<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.450> then<00:04:51.450> it

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
three tenths of a second and then it

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.080 
three tenths of a second and then it
goes<00:04:51.870> through<00:04:52.200> now<00:04:52.890> over<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:53.370> set<00:04:53.700> up<00:04:53.729> a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
goes through now over here set up a

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.350 
goes through now over here set up a
little<00:04:54.630> thing<00:04:54.840> just<00:04:55.740> continue<00:04:56.669> this<00:04:56.790> out<00:04:57.060> here

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
little thing just continue this out here

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.630 
little thing just continue this out here
so<00:04:57.660> we<00:04:57.810> can<00:04:57.960> see<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.770> it's<00:04:58.979> actually<00:04:59.100> set<00:04:59.550> in

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
so we can see that it's actually set in

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.040 
so we can see that it's actually set in
a<00:04:59.700> delay<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.860> my<00:05:02.010> duel

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
a delay it's my duel

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.210 
a delay it's my duel
and<00:05:03.289> if<00:05:04.009> we<00:05:04.099> flick<00:05:04.430> this<00:05:05.379> it'll<00:05:06.379> take<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.949> little

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
and if we flick this it'll take a little

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.649 
and if we flick this it'll take a little
while<00:05:07.340> for<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.639> 12<00:05:07.970> /<00:05:08.150> more<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.389> that<00:05:08.419> one

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
while for that 12 / more is that one

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.230 
while for that 12 / more is that one
goes<00:05:08.840> straight<00:05:09.289> away<00:05:09.560> that's<00:05:10.370> because<00:05:10.789> of<00:05:10.970> the

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
goes straight away that's because of the

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.219 
goes straight away that's because of the
delay<00:05:11.419> in<00:05:11.840> your<00:05:12.349> Peters<00:05:13.449> as<00:05:14.449> we<00:05:14.629> can<00:05:14.780> see<00:05:15.020> from

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
delay in your Peters as we can see from

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.740 
delay in your Peters as we can see from
that<00:05:17.229> all<00:05:18.229> right<00:05:18.409> I<00:05:19.250> think<00:05:19.940> that's<00:05:20.120> pretty

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
that all right I think that's pretty

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.790 
that all right I think that's pretty
