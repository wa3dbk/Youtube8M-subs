it's only a seven-foot wingspan and it's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's only a seven-foot wingspan and it's
quite<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> windy<00:00:35.370> day<00:00:35.399> today<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.300> rig<00:00:36.450> will

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
quite a windy day today so the rig will

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
quite a windy day today so the rig will
move<00:00:36.750> about<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> lot<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.739> you'll<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.540> how

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
move about a lot but you'll see just how

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
move about a lot but you'll see just how
the<00:00:39.600> kite<00:00:39.989> flies<00:00:41.629> very<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.290> fly<00:00:43.620> very

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the kite flies very easy to fly very

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.209 
the kite flies very easy to fly very
little<00:00:45.200> as<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> notice<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.890> even

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
little as you notice I'm not even

little as you notice I'm not even
wearing<00:00:47.370> gloves<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> moment<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.600> quite

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
wearing gloves at the moment it is quite

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.350 
wearing gloves at the moment it is quite
windy<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.340> makes<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> much<00:00:51.030> less

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
windy it just makes for a much less

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
windy it just makes for a much less
stressful<00:00:51.539> appearance<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:54.079> flight<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.440> healer

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
stressful appearance a flight the healer

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
stressful appearance a flight the healer
kites<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.320> letting<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
kites going out and now I'm letting it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.810 
kites going out and now I'm letting it
go<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.050> very<00:01:01.050> quick<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.770> launch<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.640> get

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
go up so very quick to launch and get

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
go up so very quick to launch and get
ready<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:04.729> simply<00:01:05.729> clipping<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> kite<00:01:07.470> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
ready and simply clipping the kite on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.789 
ready and simply clipping the kite on
the<00:01:07.830> line<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> great<00:01:09.090> way<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.770> doing<00:01:10.770> this

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the line is a great way of doing this

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.640 
the line is a great way of doing this
I've<00:01:11.100> I've<00:01:11.729> included<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> author<00:01:12.869> cap<00:01:13.290> kit

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I've I've included in the author cap kit

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.200 
I've I've included in the author cap kit
a<00:01:14.450> little<00:01:16.009> loop<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:17.729> attach

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
a little loop that you can also attach

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
a little loop that you can also attach
onto<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> line<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> clip<00:01:19.560> should<00:01:19.890> fail

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
onto the line so if the clip should fail

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
onto the line so if the clip should fail
the<00:01:20.430> rig<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.450> least<00:01:21.600> come<00:01:21.869> back<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.200> your

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the rig will at least come back to your

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.219 
the rig will at least come back to your
hands<00:01:25.250> here's<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> simple<00:01:26.580> launch<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hands here's a simple launch and as you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
hands here's a simple launch and as you
can<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.799> way<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.659> rig<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.900> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
can see the way to the rig is just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.039 
can see the way to the rig is just
allowing<00:01:31.850> me<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> let<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> line<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
allowing me to let out the line and it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
allowing me to let out the line and it
will<00:01:34.229> drift<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.009> rather<00:01:35.310> than<00:01:35.549> upwards

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
will drift out which rather than upwards

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.359 
will drift out which rather than upwards
and<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.630> hold<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> line<00:01:37.290> tight<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and then as I hold the line tight up it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
and then as I hold the line tight up it
goes<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> nice<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.810> just

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
goes this is a nice a little bit just

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.030 
goes this is a nice a little bit just
getting<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.740> close<00:01:44.149> using<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> AutoCAD

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
getting in very close using the AutoCAD

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.069 
getting in very close using the AutoCAD
letting<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> kite<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.479> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
letting the kite just take it just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
letting the kite just take it just
adjusting<00:01:49.619> where<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> camera<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:51.270> way

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
adjusting where the camera is which way

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
adjusting where the camera is which way
is<00:01:51.600> pointing<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.470> letting<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.970> can't

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
is pointing and then letting that can't

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
is pointing and then letting that can't
just<00:01:54.270> carry<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.930> over<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.500> details<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
just carry it up over the details of the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.010 
just carry it up over the details of the
building<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:59.240> using<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
building so you know just using it in a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580 
building so you know just using it in a
very<00:02:01.200> close<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.820> detail<00:02:03.780> shots<00:02:04.200> as

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
very close in way to get detail shots as

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
very close in way to get detail shots as
you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> kite<00:02:05.939> isn't<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.570> far<00:02:06.930> up

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you can see the kite isn't very far up

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.260 
you can see the kite isn't very far up
and<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.500> quite<00:02:07.710> active<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> turbulent

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and it's quite active in this turbulent

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.449 
and it's quite active in this turbulent
wind

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
wind

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.339 
wind
so<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> rig's<00:02:11.849> moving<00:02:12.390> about<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.900> enormous

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
so the rig's moving about the enormous

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.670 
so the rig's moving about the enormous
amount<00:02:13.849> but<00:02:14.849> even<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:16.200> gives<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.530> good

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
amount but even then this gives a good

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.540 
amount but even then this gives a good
idea<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.370> amount<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.879> movement<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> with

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
idea of the amount of movement but with

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.979 
idea of the amount of movement but with
a<00:02:20.610> good<00:02:20.760> shutter<00:02:21.000> speed<00:02:21.330> you'll<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.690> sharp

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
a good shutter speed you'll get sharp

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.449 
a good shutter speed you'll get sharp
shots<00:02:22.489> with<00:02:23.489> this<00:02:23.640> kind<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.090> rig<00:02:24.360> movement<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
shots with this kind of rig movement so

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.490 
shots with this kind of rig movement so
it's<00:02:26.459> worth<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.760> try<00:02:26.790> give<00:02:27.300> auto<00:02:27.660> kappa<00:02:28.019> go<00:02:28.290> it's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
it's worth a try give auto kappa go it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:43.840 
it's worth a try give auto kappa go it's
great<00:02:28.769> fun<00:02:29.450> thanks<00:02:30.450> for<00:02:30.480> watching

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.910 

you
