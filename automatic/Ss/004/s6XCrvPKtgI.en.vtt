00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.719
 Hi. How are you? I'm Dr. SanagustÃ­n 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:03.970
 and in this video I'm going to talk about macrocytic anemia. 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.589
 In the previous video I already talked about the classification 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.470
 of anemia and its symptoms. 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.440
 I talked about microcytic anemia and explain its different causes. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.660
 So what is a macrocytic anemia? 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.760
 It is an anemia in which the erythrocytes 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.279
 have a mean corpuscular volume greater than 97 fL. 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.279
 The most frequent causes of macrocytic anemia 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.400
 they are megaloblastic anemia, alcoholism and chronic liver disease. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.260
 There are other causes such as hypothyroidism, 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.070
 acute hemorrhages, medullary aplasias and others. 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.070
 Megaloblastic anemias are caused 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.800
 due to a deficit of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and / or folic acid. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.660
 The most frequent cause of anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency is the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.100
 pernicious anemia. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.530
 It is due to a lack of intrinsic factor 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.110
 for autoimmune atrophic gastritis. 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.280
 Another cause may be a gastrectomy 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.890
 or intestinal problems 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.390
 (inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, surgery or others), 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.969
 it may be due to a lack of intake (as happens with strict vegetarians) 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.549
 or by drugs such as omeprazole, metformin, colchicine or others). 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.740
 The most frequent cause of folate deficiency is usually the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 lack of intake as may occur in alcoholics and the elderly. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.860
 It must be borne in mind that in the elderly there may also be a decrease in the vitamin 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.340
 B12 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.030
 As a side effect of some drugs such as omeprazole, metformin 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 and others. 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.610
 Other causes may be the increase in need 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.530
 as in pregnancy, lactation or in some neoplasms. 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.720
 There may be a decrease in folate 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.840
 by alterations in the absorption of this that are similar 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 to the causes that affect the absorption of vitamin B12 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 and as a side effect of drugs, 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.420
 for example, methotrexate, cytostatics, anticonvulsants, contraceptives and others) 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.430
 So, how will we make the differential diagnosis? 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.490
 As always, you have to make a good clinical history 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.610
 taking into account the patient's personal pathological background: 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.880
 liver disease, alcohol consumption, drug use, previous surgery, 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 dietary habits, ... 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.939
 The causes of macrocytosis without anemia must be taken into account 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.590
 that can occur in initial stages of alcoholism and deficit of folates and vitamin 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.119
 B12 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.050
 and also with drugs that I have already cited. 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.300
 There may also be macrocytosis 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.580
 in smoking, COPD, hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia, ... 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.560
 Keep in mind that alcohol consumption 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.160
 and chronic liver diseases can be associated with 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.629
 Other alterations in the blood count such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.640
 After the history and physical examination 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.300
 will proceed to the request of 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 complementary tests that will help guide the diagnosis. 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.200
 In analytics, we can first determine the level of reticulocytes. 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.099
 If there is reticulocytosis, 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.319
 we have to rule out acute hemorrhage or hemolytic anemia. 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.410
 The anamnesis and the physical examination will have oriented us in that sense, 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.430
 especially if it is an urgent situation. 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.890
 If reticulocytes are normal or decreased, 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.690
 we will value vitamin B12, folic acid and TSH in blood. 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.989
 If we find a decrease in vitamin B12, 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.390
 folic acid or both 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.920
 we will look for the underlying cause making a correct differential diagnosis. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.510
 The existence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.980
 with gastrin elevation and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.140
 parietal cell antibodies 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.129
 they will point us towards a pernicious anemia. 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.739
 The Schilling test and gastric biopsies 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.340
 They may also be necessary for diagnosis. 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.120
 If the TSH is elevated, then we will think of a 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.920
 hypothyroidism 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 If the results of vitamin B12, folate and TSH are normal, 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.709
 we will investigate the consumption of alcohol, signs of liver disease, COPD, 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.239
 myelodysplastic diseases, medullary aplasia and 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.200
 other hematologic conditions. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.360
 It may be necessary to do a bone marrow aspirate or a bone marrow biopsy 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.320
 As always, a good orientation in the clinical history will not make things easier.
