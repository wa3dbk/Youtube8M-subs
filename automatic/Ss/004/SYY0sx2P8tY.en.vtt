model<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.949> will<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.430> six<00:00:21.060> rectangular

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
model you will need six rectangular

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.420 
model you will need six rectangular
sheets<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.529> paper<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.519> ratio<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.359> 1<00:00:25.109> by<00:00:25.350> 4

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
sheets of paper with a ratio of 1 by 4

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.900 
sheets of paper with a ratio of 1 by 4
so<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.900> sheet<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.470> 4<00:00:28.800> times<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.429> long<00:00:29.609> as

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so the the sheet is 4 times as long as

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
so the the sheet is 4 times as long as
it<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.390> wide<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.960> will<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.470> using<00:00:31.650> sheets<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it is wide I will be using sheets that

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
it is wide I will be using sheets that
are<00:00:32.520> white<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.420> side<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.960> color<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> on

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
are white on one side and color it on

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.310 
are white on one side and color it on
the<00:00:34.800> other<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.570> color<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the other but actually the color on the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
the other but actually the color on the
reverse<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> white<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.730> doesn't

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
reverse like the white side doesn't

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
reverse like the white side doesn't
really<00:00:39.780> matter<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.620> will<00:00:40.649> be<00:00:40.950> using<00:00:41.190> two

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
really matter and I will be using two

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
really matter and I will be using two
different<00:00:41.640> colors<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.079> kind<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> effect

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
different colors for this kind of effect

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.319 
different colors for this kind of effect
of<00:00:44.270> alternating<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.620> current<00:00:46.620> tips<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.329> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of alternating and current tips and this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.690 
of alternating and current tips and this
by<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> other<00:00:49.440> side<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.399> hex

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
by the way is the other side of that hex

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.430 
by the way is the other side of that hex

star now the sheets I'm using our 15
centimeters<00:00:56.100> long<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:58.070> 3.75<00:00:59.070> centimeters

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
centimeters long and 3.75 centimeters

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.299 
centimeters long and 3.75 centimeters
wide<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:02.250> 6<00:01:03.120> inches<00:01:03.660> by<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> half

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
wide or that 6 inches by one and a half

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.710 
wide or that 6 inches by one and a half
inches<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.500> diameter<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.450> star

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
inches and then the diameter of the star

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
inches and then the diameter of the star
that's<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.619> distance<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's kind of this distance right here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
that's kind of this distance right here
will<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.299> 15<00:01:12.659> centimeters<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.560> 6<00:01:13.920> inches<00:01:15.290> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
will be 15 centimeters or 6 inches so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.100 
will be 15 centimeters or 6 inches so
let's<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.979> started<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
let's get started we're first going to

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.789 
let's get started we're first going to
pinch<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.799> take

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
pinch a little so we're going to take

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.730 
pinch a little so we're going to take
one<00:01:26.070> edge<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.869> bring<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> other<00:01:28.470> edge

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
one edge and bring it to the other edge

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.789 
one edge and bring it to the other edge
but<00:01:29.460> we're<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.299> crease<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
but we're not going to crease all the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.789 
but we're not going to crease all the
way<00:01:31.829> through<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.750> maybe<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
way through but well maybe just about a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
way through but well maybe just about a
quarter<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.610> maybe<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.000> third<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.420> okay<00:01:36.720> too

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
quarter or so maybe a third is okay too

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.700 
quarter or so maybe a third is okay too
and<00:01:37.579> then<00:01:38.579> you've<00:01:38.850> got<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.450> crease<00:01:40.140> line<00:01:40.259> now

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and then you've got that crease line now

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.910 
and then you've got that crease line now
we're<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.130> take<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.790> lower<00:01:42.030> corner<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
we're going to take the lower corner and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
we're going to take the lower corner and
bring<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> lies<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.390> crease<00:01:45.689> line

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
bring it so it lies on that crease line

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
bring it so it lies on that crease line
we're<00:01:46.590> making<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> crease<00:01:47.189> through<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> top

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
we're making a crease through the top

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.039 
we're making a crease through the top
point<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.750> crease

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
point so we first want to have a crease

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.060 
point so we first want to have a crease
through<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> top<00:01:52.740> point<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:55.070> ensure

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
through the top point and then ensure

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.359 
through the top point and then ensure
that<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> corner<00:01:57.240> lies<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.979> get<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that that corner lies on there to get a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.359 
that that corner lies on there to get a
nice<00:02:00.380> 60-degree<00:02:01.380> angle<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:03.380> crease<00:02:04.380> then

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
nice 60-degree angle and crease then

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.330 
nice 60-degree angle and crease then
we're<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> take<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.329> long<00:02:06.630> edge<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
we're going to take this long edge and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
we're going to take this long edge and
we're<00:02:08.340> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> align<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
we're going to align it with the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.210 
we're going to align it with the
and<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:12.390> raw<00:02:13.110> edge<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.710> paper

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and that raw edge of the paper

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.550 
and that raw edge of the paper
while<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.730> lying<00:02:15.240> flat<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:20.180> crease<00:02:21.560> then

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
while it's lying flat and crease then

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.190 
while it's lying flat and crease then
we're<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.100> unfold<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.700> flap<00:02:24.200> and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
we're going to unfold this flap and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
we're going to unfold this flap and
we're<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> rotate<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.460> bit<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
we're just going to rotate it a bit and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390 
we're just going to rotate it a bit and
then<00:02:26.960> bring<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.140> corner<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.160> corner

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
then bring this corner to that corner

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.710 
then bring this corner to that corner
right<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.890> crease<00:02:32.720> should

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
right there and that crease should

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.010 
right there and that crease should
exactly<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:34.710> through<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.460> end<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:36.020> that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
exactly go through the end of that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.900 
exactly go through the end of that
diagonal<00:02:37.560> crease<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.750> then<00:02:39.750> unfold<00:02:40.910> then

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
diagonal crease to then unfold then

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.870 
diagonal crease to then unfold then
we're<00:02:42.210> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.540> flip<00:02:42.780> over<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> paper<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
we're going to flip over the paper and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.250 
we're going to flip over the paper and
now<00:02:44.880> we're<00:02:45.030> going<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.330> take<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.690> edge<00:02:45.990> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
now we're going to take this edge and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.690 
now we're going to take this edge and
align<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.520> raw<00:02:48.030> folded<00:02:48.600> edge<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
align it with that raw folded edge and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.420 
align it with that raw folded edge and
again<00:02:50.700> make<00:02:50.970> sure<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.210> lying<00:02:51.690> flat<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
again make sure it's lying flat so that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.780 
again make sure it's lying flat so that
we<00:02:53.940> get<00:02:54.120> nice<00:02:54.390> precise<00:02:55.140> folds<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:59.400> lot

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
we get nice precise folds and a lot

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
we get nice precise folds and a lot
align<00:03:00.240> perfectly<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.820> I'm<00:03:03.150> going<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.420> unfold

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
align perfectly then I'm going to unfold

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.730 
align perfectly then I'm going to unfold
this<00:03:04.670> flip<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.850> paper<00:03:06.030> over<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.690> fold<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
this flip the paper over and fold it

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.830 
this flip the paper over and fold it
over<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.700> edge<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:12.320> make<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.350> crease<00:03:14.840> then

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
over that edge and make a crease then

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170 
over that edge and make a crease then
we're<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.830> take<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.340> paper<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
we're going to just take that paper and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.300 
we're going to just take that paper and
fold<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.300> bring<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.380> front<00:03:22.650> like

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
fold it and bring it to the front like

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.400 
fold it and bring it to the front like
that<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:24.180> we're<00:03:24.420> going<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.660> refold<00:03:25.170> this

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
that then we're going to refold this

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.530 
that then we're going to refold this
edge<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:27.380> refold<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.920> then<00:03:29.459> our<00:03:29.730> first

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
edge and refold that and then our first

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:47.670 
edge and refold that and then our first
module<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.290> order<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.750> once<00:03:33.750> again

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.309 

now<00:03:48.680> once<00:03:49.280> you've<00:03:49.610> completed<00:03:50.180> those<00:03:50.659> folds

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
now once you've completed those folds

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.360 
now once you've completed those folds
we're<00:03:52.280> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.579> take<00:03:52.819> two<00:03:53.150> modules<00:03:53.629> and<00:03:54.370> this

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
we're going to take two modules and this

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.600 
we're going to take two modules and this
is<00:03:55.549> always<00:03:55.760> going<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.269> be<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.829> flap<00:03:58.099> like

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
is always going to be the the flap like

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.110 
is always going to be the the flap like
that's<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.090> smaller<00:03:59.390> corner<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.579> right<00:04:01.579> here

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
that's the smaller corner and right here

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.899 
that's the smaller corner and right here
there's<00:04:02.599> a<00:04:02.780> pocket<00:04:03.379> to<00:04:03.620> make<00:04:04.220> assembly<00:04:04.670> of

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
there's a pocket to make assembly of

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.970 
there's a pocket to make assembly of
them<00:04:05.000> easier<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.599> can<00:04:05.629> actually<00:04:05.989> unfold<00:04:06.739> this

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
them easier we can actually unfold this

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.550 
them easier we can actually unfold this
and<00:04:07.250> then<00:04:08.090> we're<00:04:08.269> going<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.510> take<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.170> flap

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
and then we're going to take that flap

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.179 
and then we're going to take that flap
and<00:04:09.859> insert<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.670> into<00:04:10.909> the<00:04:11.629> pocket<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.189> then

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
and insert it into the pocket and then

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.349 
and insert it into the pocket and then
you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.519> see<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:15.109> refold<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:16.359> right

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
you can see you can refold it right

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.330 
you can see you can refold it right
underneath<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:18.229> then<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.709> nice<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.160> locked

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
underneath and then it's nice and locked

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.210 
underneath and then it's nice and locked
and<00:04:19.720> then<00:04:20.720> we<00:04:20.959> continue<00:04:21.470> with<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.709> next<00:04:21.859> one

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
and then we continue with the next one

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.810 
and then we continue with the next one
going<00:04:22.910> counterclockwise<00:04:24.280> inserting<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.400> here

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
going counterclockwise inserting it here

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.529 
going counterclockwise inserting it here
and<00:04:27.370> bringing<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.610> together<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:31.539> again

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
and bringing it together and again

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.930 
and bringing it together and again
inserting<00:04:33.350> the<00:04:34.130> flap<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:36.699> refolding<00:04:37.699> that

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
inserting the flap and refolding that

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:50.770 
inserting the flap and refolding that
edge<00:04:48.370> now<00:04:49.370> for<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.699> last<00:04:49.910> one<00:04:50.240> we<00:04:50.539> can't

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
edge now for the last one we can't

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.029 
edge now for the last one we can't
actually<00:04:51.289> unfold<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:51.979> edge<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:53.830> you<00:04:54.830> can

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
actually unfold this edge so and you can

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:00.909 
actually unfold this edge so and you can
first<00:04:55.370> insert<00:04:56.210> this<00:04:56.960> tip<00:04:57.289> again<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:59.110> then<00:05:00.110> you

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
first insert this tip again and then you

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.980 
first insert this tip again and then you
just<00:05:00.949> start<00:05:01.669> fiddling<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.240> bit<00:05:02.389> can<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.690> see

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
just start fiddling a bit can you see

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.550 
just start fiddling a bit can you see
that<00:05:03.169> I'm<00:05:03.440> just<00:05:03.470> opening<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.250> little<00:05:04.430> and

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.219 

opening<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:10.010> like<00:05:10.639> that<00:05:10.849> and<00:05:11.120> kind<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:11.960> taking

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
opening it like that and kind of taking

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.689 
opening it like that and kind of taking
that<00:05:12.409> tip<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.300> starting<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.419> insert<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:14.900> and

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
that tip and starting to insert it and

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.089 
that tip and starting to insert it and
there<00:05:16.699> you<00:05:16.729> go<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.960> might<00:05:18.110> have<00:05:18.349> to<00:05:18.530> fiddle<00:05:18.800> a

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
there you go you might have to fiddle a

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.010 
there you go you might have to fiddle a
bit<00:05:19.400> longer<00:05:19.729> depends<00:05:20.419> on<00:05:20.510> how<00:05:20.630> much<00:05:20.750> practice

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
bit longer depends on how much practice

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.790 
bit longer depends on how much practice
you<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:21.590> but<00:05:22.250> then<00:05:22.520> your<00:05:23.240> beautiful<00:05:24.169> hexed
