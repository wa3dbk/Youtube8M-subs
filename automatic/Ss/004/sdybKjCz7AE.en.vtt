00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.910
 hi people in this recipe besides 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 to use Tuscan sausage in a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.969
 Different, I 'll make a sauce too. 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.920
 bittersweet that it flees a little from the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.920
 traditional but it's very yummy come on 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.910
 500 grams of Tuscan sausage medium 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.760
 green bell pepper 2 cloves garlic nor 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.700
 teaspoon grated ginger half 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.520
 cup of ketchup a tablespoon of 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.280
 corn starch soup two tablespoons 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 vinegar soup a cup of tea 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.070
 pineapple in syrup and two cloves 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.930
 The first step is to remove the skin from the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 sausage and then grind in the processor 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.469
 and then with the flytour ada is only to do 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.120
 little balls 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.890
 the secret is not to do it can be too much 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 big makes about the size of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.230
 a party brigadeiro and so does all 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.350
 your balls reserve with the pan as well 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.239
 Warm I'm going to put some olive oil 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.909
 just to prevent the meatballs from hitching 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.530
 It already has enough fat so I exaggerate 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'll put the balls here to quote 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.080
 that they are already doing well 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080
 little ladinho 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.000
 with still dirty pan sausage that 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.680
 she is full of flavor 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'll put just a little more of 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.760
 olive oil but not a little channel already 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.979
 filled with fat or remove it from the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.780
 chives because in case not using the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.690
 then onion is a great substitute but 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.390
 if you want you can use onion too 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:38.090
 I will join two cloves the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.310
 grated ginger and garlic and 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.250
 pineapple in syrup here I've already trained 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.840
 Most of her mouth is full mouth and now 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.720
 I'll answer this from here for a 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.180
 little minute I'll tell here a little 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.220
 of white wine vinegar it is better 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.259
 because it is not as acid as vinegar 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.330
 something more visual and apple or even 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.360
 the 28 here that does not have problem 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.729
 now I'll add the pineapple broth I 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.450
 I trained him and left here with a 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.289
 little corn starch I'm going to play 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.350
 to be able to thicken and flavor the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.420
 add ketchup here 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.800
 if you do not like ketchup has not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.570
 You can also use tomato pulp 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.680
 But it's important that you do not have 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.620
 no seasoning 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.150
 now I'm going to cook until I know how to stay 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 managing without stopping not to have 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.799
 danger of piloting the sauce has already 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.630
 funny time you start fiddling 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.850
 the spatula and see the bottom of the pan is 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.140
 because it's at the right point and now where 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.910
 you try if you want a 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.130
 a little more salt a little more 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.030
 sugar and you can see there I go 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.320
 put a little pepper here 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.320
 because I like a little more spicy 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.920
 roadside 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.840
 now just join the meatballs if you 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 do not like sweet brat you can 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.079
 use this same idea of doing 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.299
 meatballs with sausage and make with 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.430
 that traditional tomato sauce 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.870
 that it is also very good that 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.090
 meatballs to finish cooking 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:07.310
 sauce on a road to wrap all 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.110
 they in the eye and I will leave here running 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.110
 for three minutes or so 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.470
 and now just finish with a little 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.950
 serve as a white and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.950
 enjoy 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.510
 besides being a very different option is 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.530
 ready and 20 minutes is a delight 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 You told me at home that you found 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:52.010
 hebe and with a perfume house of music 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.010
 too much wear
