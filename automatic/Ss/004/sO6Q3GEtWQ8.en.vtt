nitrogen though to get the full benefit

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.190 
nitrogen though to get the full benefit
of<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.740> can<00:01:42.130> i<00:01:42.220> retread<00:01:42.729> my<00:01:42.909> tires<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.600> lot<00:01:44.079> of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
of it can i retread my tires a lot of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.990 
of it can i retread my tires a lot of
aircraft<00:01:44.470> tires<00:01:44.890> out<00:01:45.159> there<00:01:45.369> are<00:01:45.549> retread

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
aircraft tires out there are retread

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.179 
aircraft tires out there are retread
about<00:01:46.240> commercial<00:01:47.110> aviation<00:01:47.229> tires<00:01:47.890> and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
about commercial aviation tires and

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.190 
about commercial aviation tires and
military<00:01:48.579> tires<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.509> don't<00:01:49.689> design<00:01:49.960> our

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.139 
military tires we don't design our
general<00:01:50.469> aviation<00:01:50.590> tires<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.430> be<00:01:51.579> retreaded

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
general aviation tires to be retreaded

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.969 
general aviation tires to be retreaded
so<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.390> really<00:01:52.630> don't<00:01:52.810> recommend<00:01:53.140> retraining

so we really don't recommend retraining

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.980 
so we really don't recommend retraining
those<00:01:54.130> tires<00:01:54.399> alright<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.450> here's<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.689> question

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990
