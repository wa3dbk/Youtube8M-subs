00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
shape he's worth about $70 now if you
had<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> original<00:01:55.409> box<00:01:55.680> everything<00:01:56.610> goes<00:01:56.759> up

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
had the original box everything goes up

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
did then much more mass production now

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
did then much more mass production now
so<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.399> people<00:02:08.520> start<00:02:08.849> collecting<00:02:09.239> things

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so when people start collecting things

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
so when people start collecting things
now<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:10.050> dolls<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.099> remember<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
now like dolls like this remember that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.030 
now like dolls like this remember that
there's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
there's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
there's
of<00:02:13.310> them<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.150> whole<00:02:14.299> collectible<00:02:14.840> craze

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
of them and the whole collectible craze

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.630 
of them and the whole collectible craze
is<00:02:15.260> becoming<00:02:15.590> more<00:02:15.830> common<00:02:16.220> in<00:02:16.310> people's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
is becoming more common in people's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.300 
is becoming more common in people's
psyche<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.599> collecting<00:02:18.170> things<00:02:18.319> now<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.129> may

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
psyche so collecting things now it may

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.449 
psyche so collecting things now it may
not<00:02:19.340> get<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:19.939> what<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.930> did<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.379> 70s<00:02:21.860> you

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
not get you what you did in the 70s you

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.100 
not get you what you did in the 70s you
may<00:02:22.579> have<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.819> wait<00:02:22.939> a<00:02:23.000> hundred<00:02:23.299> years<00:02:23.750> instead

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
may have to wait a hundred years instead

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.020 
may have to wait a hundred years instead
of<00:02:24.230> 20<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.129> I<00:02:25.220> don't<00:02:25.280> think<00:02:25.459> we'll<00:02:25.670> live<00:02:25.849> that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
of 20 and I don't think we'll live that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.970 
of 20 and I don't think we'll live that
long<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:26.840> just<00:02:27.049> keep<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.230> in<00:02:27.530> mind<00:02:27.739> when<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
long so just keep that in mind when you

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.890 
long so just keep that in mind when you
collect<00:02:28.340> right<00:02:29.090> Linus<00:02:29.560> he<00:02:30.560> agrees
