gonna want to stop while you're rushing

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.570 
gonna want to stop while you're rushing
to<00:02:05.340> use<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.060> use<00:02:06.450> something<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.500> can<00:02:08.220> direct

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to use it use something that can direct

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
to use it use something that can direct
itself<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.360> does<00:02:09.599> kills<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.950> its<00:02:11.099> own

itself and does kills people on its own

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.449 
itself and does kills people on its own
okay

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
okay

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.080 
okay
step<00:02:13.120> four<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.319> for<00:02:14.560> right

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
step four I think this is for right

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.229 
step four I think this is for right
step<00:02:16.720> four<00:02:17.200> all<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.129> is<00:02:18.670> pretty

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
step four all right this is pretty

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.399 
step four all right this is pretty
common-sense<00:02:19.659> also<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:22.629> sensitivity<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
common-sense also the sensitivity that

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.600 
common-sense also the sensitivity that
you<00:02:23.590> use<00:02:23.980> has<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.549> be<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.569> your<00:02:25.780> liking<00:02:26.049> yeah<00:02:26.980> it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
you use has to be to your liking yeah it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.839 
you use has to be to your liking yeah it
has<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.150> your<00:02:28.269> liking<00:02:29.189> say<00:02:30.189> you're

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
has to be to your liking say you're

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.690 
has to be to your liking say you're
using<00:02:31.000> ten<00:02:31.329> sensitivity<00:02:32.049> because<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.220> saw<00:02:33.430> in

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
using ten sensitivity because you saw in

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.009 
using ten sensitivity because you saw in
a<00:02:33.790> quick<00:02:34.060> scope<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.450> guide<00:02:34.629> or<00:02:34.870> something

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
a quick scope and guide or something

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.110 
a quick scope and guide or something
like<00:02:35.439> you<00:02:36.370> don't<00:02:36.519> want<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> seizure

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
like you don't want to have a seizure

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.880 
like you don't want to have a seizure
while<00:02:37.450> you're<00:02:37.599> playing<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> game<00:02:37.989> okay<00:02:38.560> you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
while you're playing the game okay you

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.470 
while you're playing the game okay you
don't<00:02:38.980> want<00:02:39.159> to<00:02:39.250> spin<00:02:39.489> around<00:02:39.579> and<00:02:39.879> circle<00:02:40.269> so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
don't want to spin around and circle so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.559 
don't want to spin around and circle so
much<00:02:40.659> that<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.930> throw<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.409> either<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
much that you throw up either so you

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.690 
much that you throw up either so you
just<00:02:43.720> use<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.319> sensitivity<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.400> like

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
just use the sensitivity that you like

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.849 
just use the sensitivity that you like
and<00:02:46.000> I'm<00:02:46.870> sure<00:02:47.049> you'll<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.349> fine

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
and I'm sure you'll do fine

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.460 
and I'm sure you'll do fine
so<00:02:48.459> last<00:02:49.389> tip<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.159> if<00:02:51.159> you<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> headset

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so last tip is if you have a headset

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.020 
so last tip is if you have a headset
then<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.500> would<00:02:53.739> recommend<00:02:54.159> using<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.730> because

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
then I would recommend using it because

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.750 
then I would recommend using it because
game<00:02:55.690> sound<00:02:56.109> listening<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.099> game<00:02:57.310> while

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
game sound listening to the game while

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.330 
game sound listening to the game while
you're<00:02:57.939> playing<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.389> can<00:02:58.659> be<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> huge<00:02:59.500> benefit

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
you're playing it can be a huge benefit

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.399 
you're playing it can be a huge benefit
to<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:03.370> know<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:04.450> it's<00:03:04.959> hard<00:03:05.079> to

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
to you and you know it's it's hard to

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.940 
to you and you know it's it's hard to
play<00:03:06.370> without<00:03:06.760> any<00:03:07.000> game<00:03:07.269> sound<00:03:07.569> so<00:03:08.319> that<00:03:08.829> was

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
play without any game sound so that was

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.860 
play without any game sound so that was
the<00:03:09.069> video<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.909> lasted<00:03:10.299> three<00:03:10.569> minutes

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
the video and it lasted three minutes

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.940 
the video and it lasted three minutes
and<00:03:11.019> 10<00:03:11.430> 11<00:03:12.430> 12<00:03:12.970> seconds<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.989> was<00:03:14.859> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and 10 11 12 seconds so that was the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.849 
and 10 11 12 seconds so that was the
video<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:16.510> will<00:03:16.690> probably<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:17.530> over

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
video and this will probably be over

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.809 
video and this will probably be over
some<00:03:18.930> random<00:03:19.930> ghost<00:03:20.560> clips<00:03:20.919> of<00:03:21.160> me<00:03:21.310> going<00:03:21.579> on<00:03:21.790> a

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
streak and killing all those noobs that

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.000 
streak and killing all those noobs that
don't<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.849> how<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> play<00:03:25.329> like<00:03:25.840> me<00:03:26.079> with<00:03:26.859> all
