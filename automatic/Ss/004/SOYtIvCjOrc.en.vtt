00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.090 
can make it over the barrels like I did
but<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.020> don't<00:02:01.200> recommend<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.799> because<00:02:01.920> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
but I don't recommend it because I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.690 
but I don't recommend it because I
almost<00:02:02.219> crashed<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.829> here<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.340> got

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
almost crashed like that here I also got

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.590 
almost crashed like that here I also got
lucky

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
lucky

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.540 
lucky
and<00:02:06.690> did<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.620> really<00:02:07.860> quickly<00:02:08.070> but<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.490> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and did that really quickly but what you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240 
and did that really quickly but what you
got<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:08.940> lean<00:02:09.149> backwards<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.710> yeah

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
got to do is lean backwards but yeah

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
got to do is lean backwards but yeah
this<00:02:11.640> part<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> planks<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
this part right here with the planks so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.840 
this part right here with the planks so
there's<00:02:13.440> somehow<00:02:13.620> rubberized<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:14.820> of

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
there's somehow rubberized this kind of

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.020 
there's somehow rubberized this kind of
simple<00:02:15.090> bow<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.110> ball<00:02:16.350> part<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.430> get

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
simple bow on this ball part you can get

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.790 
simple bow on this ball part you can get
enough<00:02:18.270> speed<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.600> jump<00:02:19.020> over<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> first<00:02:19.590> ball

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
enough speed to jump over the first ball

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.550 
enough speed to jump over the first ball
and<00:02:19.950> land<00:02:20.130> safely<00:02:20.490> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> second<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.260> but<00:02:22.260> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and land safely on the second one but I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.460 
and land safely on the second one but I
wouldn't<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.880> risky<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.260> might

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
wouldn't kind of risky and you might

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.410 
wouldn't kind of risky and you might
mess<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:26.520> got<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.880> maintain

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
mess up here you just got to maintain

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
mess up here you just got to maintain
the<00:02:27.870> brake<00:02:28.080> so<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> slowly<00:02:28.770> rolls<00:02:29.040> forward

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the brake so it slowly rolls forward

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.390 
the brake so it slowly rolls forward
jump<00:02:30.120> over<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.480> second<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.400> eventually

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
jump over to the second and eventually

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.100 
jump over to the second and eventually
you<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.670> land<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.090> platform<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.959> do

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you can land on that platform and do

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.199 
you can land on that platform and do
these<00:02:34.260> last<00:02:34.590> two<00:02:34.980> halfpipe<00:02:35.760> thing<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:38.209> this

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
these last two halfpipe thing and this

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.210 
these last two halfpipe thing and this
part<00:02:39.570> at<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> end<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.020> really<00:02:40.170> simple<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
part at the end is really simple but the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
part at the end is really simple but the
whole<00:02:41.370> track<00:02:41.730> can<00:02:42.209> pull<00:02:42.480> off<00:02:42.630> all<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> steel

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
whole track can pull off all the steel

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.699 
whole track can pull off all the steel
like<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.590> did<00:02:43.770> when<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.010> got<00:02:44.270> insanely<00:02:45.270> lucky<00:02:45.709> but

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
like I did when I got insanely lucky but

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.340 
like I did when I got insanely lucky but
you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.190> take<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.670> slow<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:48.209> you're<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.810> not

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
you know take it slow if you're like not

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.830 
you know take it slow if you're like not
that<00:02:49.500> good<00:02:50.030> or<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.239> you're<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.540> horrible

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that good or if you're just horrible

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 
that good or if you're just horrible
like<00:02:52.020> me<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> got<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.459> really<00:02:53.700> take<00:02:53.910> this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
like me then you got to really take this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.740 
like me then you got to really take this
left<00:02:54.270> right<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.320> next<00:02:55.530> track<00:02:55.800> here<00:02:56.070> is

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
left right the next track here is

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.990 
left right the next track here is
Groundhog<00:02:57.750> returns<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.709> medium<00:02:59.190> I'm<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.910> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
Groundhog returns on medium I'm going to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.690 
Groundhog returns on medium I'm going to
scroll<00:03:00.239> down<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.600> eventually<00:03:01.459> there<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.580> go

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
scroll down to it eventually there we go

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.240 
scroll down to it eventually there we go
finally<00:03:03.120> got<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.739> checked<00:03:04.739> my<00:03:04.830> high<00:03:04.950> scores

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
finally got it I checked my high scores

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.070 
finally got it I checked my high scores
for<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.550> replay<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.209> don't<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.600> one<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:06.840> I

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
for the replay so I don't have one so I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.900 
for the replay so I don't have one so I
did<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.410> again

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
did it again

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.520 
did it again
fear<00:03:08.910> you're<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.300> gonna<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:09.930> enough<00:03:10.170> speed

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
fear you're just gonna get enough speed

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.930 
fear you're just gonna get enough speed
from<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.890> container<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.370> make<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.730> over<00:03:11.820> to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
from this container to make it over to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.289 
from this container to make it over to
the<00:03:12.060> second<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.510> go<00:03:13.260> up<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.590> ramp<00:03:14.299> leaning

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
the second one go up this ramp leaning

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.570 
the second one go up this ramp leaning
backwards<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.019> your<00:03:16.200> tire<00:03:16.380> can<00:03:16.620> catch<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:17.010> go

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
backwards like your tire can catch it go

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.009 
backwards like your tire can catch it go
over<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.910> jump<00:03:18.120> at<00:03:18.209> full<00:03:18.450> throttle<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:18.959> you

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
over this jump at full throttle so you

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.479 
over this jump at full throttle so you
can<00:03:19.140> make<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.380> over<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> explosives<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.280> not

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
can make it over the explosives and not

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.660 
can make it over the explosives and not
blow<00:03:20.790> up<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.150> die<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.709> here<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.130> got<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.430> land

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
blow up and die and here you got to land

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.600 
blow up and die and here you got to land
on<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.299> one<00:03:24.540> break<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.350> then<00:03:25.650> jump<00:03:25.680> over<00:03:26.070> to

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
on this one break and then jump over to

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.229 
on this one break and then jump over to
this<00:03:26.760> container<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.610> part<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.940> got<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.060> get

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
this container this part you got to get

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.490 
this container this part you got to get
enough<00:03:30.390> speed<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.019> land<00:03:31.200> on<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
enough speed so you can land on the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.250 
enough speed so you can land on the
second<00:03:31.829> metal<00:03:32.040> ramp<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.870> jump<00:03:33.870> over<00:03:34.019> this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
second metal ramp and jump over this

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.090 
second metal ramp and jump over this
little<00:03:34.500> area<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.340> pipes<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:37.769> hit<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
little area of pipes and you hit the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.680 
little area of pipes and you hit the
last<00:03:38.280> jump<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.760> you're<00:03:38.940> set<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.329> then<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
last jump and you're set and then you

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.240 
last jump and you're set and then you
can<00:03:39.810> smash<00:03:40.170> your<00:03:40.320> face<00:03:40.470> into<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.739> wall<00:03:40.980> like

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
can smash your face into the wall like

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.789 
can smash your face into the wall like
you<00:03:41.400> always<00:03:41.760> wanted<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.440> just<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.680> hell

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
you always wanted to just for the hell

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.780 
you always wanted to just for the hell
of<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:45.049> next<00:03:46.049> track<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:48.000> rise<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.630> fall<00:03:48.930> on

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
of it next track is the rise and fall on

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.789 
of it next track is the rise and fall on
hard<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.510> got<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.780> go<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.019> these<00:03:55.170> beginning

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
hard so you got to go up these beginning

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.420 
hard so you got to go up these beginning
ramps

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
ramps

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.580 
ramps
always<00:03:58.329> hippie<00:03:58.629> their<00:03:58.780> back<00:03:59.019> tire<00:03:59.290> first

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
always hippie their back tire first

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.050 
always hippie their back tire first
because<00:03:59.980> if<00:04:00.099> you<00:04:00.189> don't<00:04:00.400> you'll<00:04:00.640> just<00:04:00.819> roll

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
because if you don't you'll just roll

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.610 
because if you don't you'll just roll
backwards<00:04:03.780> here<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.079> got<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.319> go<00:04:05.409> with<00:04:05.500> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
backwards here you got to go with the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.500 
backwards here you got to go with the
second<00:04:06.010> one<00:04:06.129> ramp<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.610> then<00:04:06.730> here<00:04:06.970> take<00:04:07.329> it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
second one ramp and then here take it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.009 
second one ramp and then here take it
slow<00:04:07.890> just<00:04:08.890> barely<00:04:09.220> go<00:04:09.549> over<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.299> keep

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
slow just barely go over that and keep

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.479 
slow just barely go over that and keep
hitting<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.379> brakes<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:11.890> can<00:04:12.069> make<00:04:12.280> use

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
hitting the brakes so you can make use

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.529 
hitting the brakes so you can make use
of<00:04:12.519> this<00:04:12.790> giant<00:04:13.650> bottomless<00:04:14.650> area<00:04:15.129> it's<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.209> get

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
of this giant bottomless area it's a get

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.879 
of this giant bottomless area it's a get
enough<00:04:16.690> speed<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.930> go<00:04:17.109> up<00:04:17.259> there<00:04:17.530> which<00:04:17.769> is

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
enough speed to go up there which is

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.340 
enough speed to go up there which is
kind<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.370> pain<00:04:18.579> in<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.699> ass<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.900> simple

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
kind of a pain in the ass on a simple

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.550 
kind of a pain in the ass on a simple
ramp<00:04:20.560> land<00:04:21.459> flat<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.180> you're<00:04:22.509> good<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.169> set

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
ramp land flat and you're good and set

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.740 
ramp land flat and you're good and set
on<00:04:24.130> these<00:04:24.280> metal<00:04:24.580> ramps<00:04:24.910> don't<00:04:25.300> do<00:04:25.539> that

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
on these metal ramps don't do that

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.560 
on these metal ramps don't do that
because<00:04:26.320> you'll<00:04:26.710> die<00:04:26.889> like<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.550> did<00:04:27.789> then<00:04:28.419> I

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
because you'll die like I did then I

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.900 
because you'll die like I did then I
stubbornly<00:04:28.900> refused<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.889> give<00:04:30.160> up<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.550> then<00:04:30.820> I

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
stubbornly refused to give up and then I

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.090 
stubbornly refused to give up and then I
finally<00:04:31.120> did<00:04:31.449> after<00:04:32.350> wasting<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.800> couple<00:04:33.039> of

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
finally did after wasting a couple of

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.820 
finally did after wasting a couple of
seconds<00:04:33.660> then<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.750> got<00:04:34.870> a<00:04:34.900> punch<00:04:35.440> in<00:04:35.560> full

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
seconds then you got a punch in full

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.520 
seconds then you got a punch in full
throttle<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.639> then<00:04:37.539> he's<00:04:37.840> on<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.110> gas<00:04:38.260> on

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
throttle and then he's on the gas on

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.920 
throttle and then he's on the gas on
these<00:04:38.650> like<00:04:39.100> Anglet<00:04:39.910> parts<00:04:40.240> just<00:04:40.539> if<00:04:40.840> you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
these like Anglet parts just if you

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.750 
these like Anglet parts just if you
punch<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.320> gas<00:04:41.440> your<00:04:41.770> front<00:04:42.010> tire<00:04:42.220> will<00:04:42.490> flip

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
punch the gas your front tire will flip

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.450 
punch the gas your front tire will flip
backwards<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.229> part<00:04:44.500> yeah<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.949> punch<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
backwards on this part yeah I punch the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.000 
backwards on this part yeah I punch the
gas<00:04:45.639> and<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:45.940> failed<00:04:46.240> so<00:04:46.630> don't<00:04:46.840> do<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.010> this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
gas and I failed so don't do that this

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.400 
gas and I failed so don't do that this
one<00:04:48.220> is<00:04:48.310> pretty<00:04:48.550> simple<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.810> hard<00:04:50.050> tracks

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
one is pretty simple for the hard tracks

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.659 
one is pretty simple for the hard tracks
but<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.919> final<00:04:53.919> track<00:04:54.130> of<00:04:54.280> trials

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
but this is final track of trials

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.460 
but this is final track of trials
tribulations<00:04:55.229> it's<00:04:56.229> hard<00:04:56.740> also<00:04:58.259> it's<00:04:59.259> a<00:04:59.320> lot

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
tribulations it's hard also it's a lot

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.629 
tribulations it's hard also it's a lot
if<00:04:59.650> there's<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.889> lot<00:05:00.039> of<00:05:00.070> these<00:05:00.190> cracker<00:05:00.460> you've

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
if there's a lot of these cracker you've

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.219 
if there's a lot of these cracker you've
got<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.849> found<00:05:01.120> soft<00:05:01.389> stuff<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.139> little

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
got a found soft stuff and a little

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.469 
got a found soft stuff and a little
steep<00:05:02.560> bits<00:05:02.830> but<00:05:03.130> here<00:05:03.789> you<00:05:03.910> got<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.150> go<00:05:04.210> full

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
steep bits but here you got to go full

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.550 
steep bits but here you got to go full
throttle<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:04.990> can<00:05:05.080> make<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.320> over<00:05:05.380> the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
throttle so you can make it over the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.520 
throttle so you can make it over the
explosives<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:06.250> not<00:05:06.550> die<00:05:06.810> at<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:07.990> part<00:05:08.349> I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
explosives and not die at this part I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.460 
explosives and not die at this part I
mess<00:05:08.710> up<00:05:09.389> and<00:05:10.389> I'm<00:05:10.510> a<00:05:10.599> third<00:05:10.780> trial<00:05:11.020> get<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:11.320> but

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
mess up and I'm a third trial get it but

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.110 
mess up and I'm a third trial get it but
what<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.650> got<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.830> do<00:05:12.010> go<00:05:12.639> all<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.880> way<00:05:12.940> back

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
what you got to do go all the way back

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.110 
what you got to do go all the way back
so<00:05:13.180> right<00:05:13.630> there<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.979> your<00:05:15.159> two<00:05:15.490> tires

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
so right there and have your two tires

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.020 
so right there and have your two tires
hit<00:05:16.930> that<00:05:17.199> upward<00:05:17.680> plank<00:05:17.979> evenly<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:18.849> that<00:05:18.970> you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
hit that upward plank evenly so that you

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330 
hit that upward plank evenly so that you
could<00:05:19.180> hit<00:05:19.750> yourself<00:05:20.080> up<00:05:20.289> I<00:05:20.620> think<00:05:21.010> I<00:05:21.099> get<00:05:21.250> it

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
could hit yourself up I think I get it

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.360 
could hit yourself up I think I get it
yeah<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.639> got<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:21.880> right<00:05:21.970> here<00:05:22.270> right<00:05:22.560> here<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:24.340> a

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
yeah I got it right here right here do a

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.189 
yeah I got it right here right here do a
backflip<00:05:24.880> onto<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.270> ramp<00:05:25.570> but<00:05:25.840> don't<00:05:26.050> get

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
backflip onto this ramp but don't get

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.439 
backflip onto this ramp but don't get
too<00:05:26.260> much<00:05:26.650> speed<00:05:27.010> because<00:05:27.669> you're<00:05:27.880> gonna<00:05:27.970> hit

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
too much speed because you're gonna hit

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.689 
too much speed because you're gonna hit
your<00:05:28.630> head<00:05:28.780> on<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.110> that<00:05:29.260> container<00:05:29.530> block<00:05:29.889> on

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
your head on to that container block on

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.490 
your head on to that container block on
this<00:05:30.849> part<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:31.630> got<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:31.840> go<00:05:31.930> up<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:32.380> then

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
this part you got to go up but then

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.899 
this part you got to go up but then
you've<00:05:32.560> got<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.800> get<00:05:32.949> over<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.220> little<00:05:33.280> tiny

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
you've got to get over that little tiny

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.969 
you've got to get over that little tiny
wooden<00:05:34.300> wall<00:05:34.630> with<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.199> with<00:05:35.440> enough<00:05:35.710> speed

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
wooden wall with that with enough speed

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.629 
wooden wall with that with enough speed
to<00:05:36.039> make<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.490> over<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:36.789> gap<00:05:36.970> right<00:05:37.349> here

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
to make it over that gap right here

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.800 
to make it over that gap right here
don't<00:05:39.639> get<00:05:39.880> your<00:05:40.000> tire<00:05:40.180> stuck<00:05:40.479> in<00:05:40.599> there

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
because then no stubbornly refuse to

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.350 
because then no stubbornly refuse to
give<00:05:44.380> up<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:44.800> then<00:05:44.979> trying<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.789> waste<00:05:45.970> like

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
give up and then trying and waste like

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.920 
give up and then trying and waste like
20<00:05:46.840> seconds<00:05:48.120> what<00:05:49.120> you<00:05:49.210> got<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.419> do<00:05:49.539> is<00:05:49.720> make<00:05:49.900> it

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
20 seconds what you got to do is make it

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.480 
20 seconds what you got to do is make it
over<00:05:50.199> that<00:05:50.289> little<00:05:50.440> gap<00:05:50.710> without<00:05:50.919> crashing

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
over that little gap without crashing

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.480 
over that little gap without crashing
like<00:05:51.639> I<00:05:51.789> did<00:05:51.970> and<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:53.710> were<00:05:53.740> like<00:05:53.949> that<00:05:54.159> but

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
like I did and you were like that but

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.710 
like I did and you were like that but
then<00:05:54.610> you've<00:05:54.789> got<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.030> get<00:05:55.120> enough<00:05:55.389> speed<00:05:55.690> so

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
then you've got to get enough speed so

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.839 
then you've got to get enough speed so
make<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.199> over<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.470> container<00:05:56.740> because<00:05:57.010> don't

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
make it over the container because don't

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.899 
make it over the container because don't
hit<00:05:58.210> your<00:05:58.300> front<00:05:58.539> tire<00:05:58.720> and<00:05:58.750> roll<00:05:59.050> backwards

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
hit your front tire and roll backwards

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.990 
hit your front tire and roll backwards
and<00:06:00.909> then<00:06:01.330> get<00:06:01.449> stuck<00:06:01.630> second

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
and then get stuck second

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.350 
and then get stuck second
see<00:06:04.000> here<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:04.270> finally<00:06:04.480> got<00:06:04.720> it<00:06:05.640> this<00:06:06.640> came<00:06:07.210> the
