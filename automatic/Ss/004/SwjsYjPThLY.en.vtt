00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:02.030
 but she 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 problem 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.600
 fully equipped they made it clear that 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
 Alexey Sevastyanov 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.060
 on anterior asia 3 3 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 in article 105 h 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
 to date 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.970
 the problem is in 2000 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.870
 in case of trying 85 billion dollars in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.600
 year 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.710
 degree estimates because most in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 this is not in pharmacies without prescriptions but because 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 great-nephew 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 monthly 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.490
 add what exactly does will be 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.490
 continued 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 so we drove through the first day 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 6 more rebounds 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 I think 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.460
 play like that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.120
 besides the project 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.130
 says they say nothing but 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.800
 then 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.280
 football in another why government 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 but if not in connection with all matters in 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.930
 development areas of the eastern district 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 Yuri Neelov 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.930
 still in question 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.049
 he has normal development 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.649
 it would be interesting to learn about work 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.659
 plan around the world 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.659
 think now 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 creativity anxiety 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.959
 when visitors 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
 I do not know 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:54.900
