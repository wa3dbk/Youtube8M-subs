00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
wheel off at all it's a really easy

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.880 
wheel off at all it's a really easy
operation<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.869> we<00:01:19.960> need<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.320> open<00:01:20.530> end

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
operation and then we need to open end

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.160 
operation and then we need to open end
wrenches<00:01:21.189> in<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.909> case<00:01:22.119> to<00:01:22.450> twelve<00:01:22.780> Mills

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
wrenches in this case to twelve Mills

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.499 
wrenches in this case to twelve Mills
but<00:01:23.829> again<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.610> you're<00:01:24.729> on<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> different<00:01:25.180> bike

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
but again if you're on a different bike

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.910 
but again if you're on a different bike
it's<00:01:25.840> probably<00:01:26.110> gonna<00:01:26.200> be<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.350> 10<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.799> 12

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
it's probably gonna be a 10 and a 12

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.870 
it's probably gonna be a 10 and a 12
sometimes<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.380> again<00:01:29.890> what<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.610> actual

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
sometimes so again what the actual

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.550 
sometimes so again what the actual
fitment<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.509> sizes<00:01:31.840> are<00:01:31.960> might<00:01:32.170> be<00:01:32.200> different

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
fitment and sizes are might be different

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.020 
fitment and sizes are might be different
for<00:01:32.649> your<00:01:32.740> bike<00:01:32.950> but<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> principles<00:01:33.820> are<00:01:33.909> all

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
for your bike but the principles are all

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.740 
for your bike but the principles are all
the<00:01:34.119> same<00:01:36.000> you'll<00:01:37.000> see<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.149> bikes<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.600> on<00:01:37.720> a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
the same you'll see the bikes up on a

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.080 
the same you'll see the bikes up on a
rear<00:01:37.990> stand<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.490> don't<00:01:39.670> have<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.850> rear

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
rear stand if you don't have a rear

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.270 
rear stand if you don't have a rear
stand<00:01:40.270> that's<00:01:40.420> okay<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:41.049> do<00:01:41.319> this<00:01:41.470> by

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
stand that's okay you can do this by

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.639 
stand that's okay you can do this by
yourself<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.720> only<00:01:43.840> thing<00:01:44.049> is<00:01:44.140> doing<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.500> on

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
yourself the only thing is doing it on

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.770 
yourself the only thing is doing it on
the<00:01:44.799> side<00:01:44.979> stand<00:01:45.280> it's<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.090> totally<00:01:46.630> accurate

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the side stand it's not totally accurate

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.570 
the side stand it's not totally accurate
and<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.679> might<00:01:47.830> have<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.100> make<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.280> few<00:01:48.429> more

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
and you might have to make a few more

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.190 
and you might have to make a few more
adjustments<00:01:48.700> because<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.840> weight<00:01:50.049> and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
adjustments because of the weight and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.850 
adjustments because of the weight and
stuff<00:01:50.920> like<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.750> another<00:01:52.750> thing<00:01:52.959> to<00:01:53.049> do<00:01:53.170> you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
stuff like this another thing to do you

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.199 
stuff like this another thing to do you
can<00:01:53.920> have<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.159> friend<00:01:54.520> help<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.819> and<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.179> can

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
can have a friend help you and you can

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.089 
can have a friend help you and you can
lean<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.319> rear<00:01:56.500> wheels<00:01:56.709> in<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.009> air

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
lean it up so the rear wheels in the air

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.660 
lean it up so the rear wheels in the air
you<00:01:57.490> put<00:01:57.939> it<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> side<00:01:58.569> stand<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.520> this

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
you put it up on the side stand but this

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.460 
you put it up on the side stand but this
is<00:02:00.849> kind<00:02:01.090> of<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.509> easiest<00:02:01.869> and<00:02:02.140> most

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
is kind of the easiest and most

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.339 
is kind of the easiest and most
efficiently<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.360> don't<00:02:04.959> worry<00:02:05.080> if<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.289> don't

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
efficiently so don't worry if you don't

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.710 
efficiently so don't worry if you don't
have<00:02:05.590> one<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.860> still<00:02:06.130> do<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.390> all<00:02:07.539> I<00:02:07.569> have

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
have one you still do it so all I have

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.259 
have one you still do it so all I have
to<00:02:07.750> do<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:09.130> lift<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.549> got<00:02:09.759> loose

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
to do you lift you got loose

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.590 
to do you lift you got loose
basically<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.959> at<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.099> point<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:13.060> idea<00:02:13.359> here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
basically so at this point the idea here

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.509 
basically so at this point the idea here
is<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:13.840> block<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.530> call<00:02:14.980> your<00:02:15.130> axle<00:02:15.459> just

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
is this block just call your axle just

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.610 
is this block just call your axle just
there's<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.000> support<00:02:16.329> block<00:02:16.570> same<00:02:17.320> thing<00:02:17.500> on

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
there's a support block same thing on

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.910 
there's a support block same thing on
the<00:02:17.709> other<00:02:17.739> side<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.579> got<00:02:18.700> one<00:02:18.820> over<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.120> too

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the other side you got one over here too

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.539 
the other side you got one over here too
and<00:02:20.920> then<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.489> threaded<00:02:22.060> bolt

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
and then you have this threaded bolt

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.880 
and then you have this threaded bolt
that<00:02:24.549> basically<00:02:24.959> dictates<00:02:25.959> how<00:02:26.319> far<00:02:26.620> forward

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
that basically dictates how far forward

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.030 
that basically dictates how far forward
or<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.700> back<00:02:27.970> your<00:02:28.810> wheel<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.799> going<00:02:29.950> to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
or you know back your wheel is going to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.599 
or you know back your wheel is going to
move<00:02:30.220> now<00:02:31.120> our<00:02:31.510> chain<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.410> super<00:02:32.709> loose<00:02:32.890> we

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
move now our chain was super loose we

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.180 
move now our chain was super loose we
had<00:02:33.730> probably<00:02:34.540> over<00:02:34.870> two<00:02:35.049> inches<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.410> play<00:02:35.590> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
had probably over two inches of play and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.000 
had probably over two inches of play and
you<00:02:36.459> only<00:02:36.579> want<00:02:36.880> one<00:02:37.150> inch<00:02:37.870> give<00:02:38.440> or<00:02:38.620> take<00:02:38.769> you

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you only want one inch give or take you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.559 
you only want one inch give or take you
know<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.220> don't<00:02:39.370> want<00:02:39.549> your<00:02:40.060> better<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.359> go<00:02:40.450> in

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
know you don't want your better to go in

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780 
know you don't want your better to go in
a<00:02:40.630> little<00:02:40.690> bit<00:02:40.900> looser<00:02:41.230> side<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.430> about<00:02:42.639> an

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
a little bit looser side so about an

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.970 
a little bit looser side so about an
inch<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.930> want<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.709> as

you can see that thanks slapping around

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.729 
you can see that thanks slapping around
a<00:02:48.340> lot<00:02:48.489> now<00:02:49.120> what<00:02:49.269> can<00:02:49.389> happen<00:02:49.569> from<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.989> change

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
a lot now what can happen from a change

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.490 
a lot now what can happen from a change
to<00:02:50.920> lose<00:02:51.480> first<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.660> foremost<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.139> can<00:02:53.260> tear

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
to lose first and foremost you can tear

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.820 
to lose first and foremost you can tear
each<00:02:53.620> brockett's<00:02:54.100> up

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
each brockett's up

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.800 
each brockett's up
if<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.010> have<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.310> chain<00:02:55.970> that's<00:02:56.240> slapping

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
if you have this chain that's slapping

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.390 
if you have this chain that's slapping
around<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.380> cause<00:02:57.850> swingarm<00:02:58.850> damage<00:02:59.240> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
around you can cause swingarm damage and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.770 
around you can cause swingarm damage and
your<00:03:01.400> your<00:03:01.790> overall<00:03:02.090> performance<00:03:02.270> and

your your overall performance and
throttle<00:03:03.110> response<00:03:03.200> will<00:03:03.590> be<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.830> crisp

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
throttle response will be is crisp

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.160 
throttle response will be is crisp
either<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.730> when<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.420> thing<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.690> loose<00:03:05.990> and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
either so when this thing is loose and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.050 
either so when this thing is loose and
flapping<00:03:06.530> around<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.490> want<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:07.730> tighten<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
flapping around you want to tighten it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.800 
flapping around you want to tighten it
up<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.980> first<00:03:09.980> step<00:03:10.160> that's<00:03:10.520> loose<00:03:10.850> secondly

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
up so first step that's loose secondly

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.110 
up so first step that's loose secondly
you<00:03:12.350> want<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.590> loosen<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.980> inner<00:03:13.130> most<00:03:13.370> of

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
you want to loosen the inner most of

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.500 
you want to loosen the inner most of
these<00:03:14.450> two<00:03:14.780> bolts<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.250> all<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.490> do<00:03:16.610> you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
these two bolts here so all you do you

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.150 
these two bolts here so all you do you
can<00:03:17.660> try<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.900> by<00:03:18.050> itself<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.740> sometimes

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
can try it by itself and sometimes

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.620 
can try it by itself and sometimes
you'll<00:03:19.520> need<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.820> hold<00:03:19.970> both<00:03:20.150> at<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.450> same

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
you'll need to hold both at the same

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.830 
you'll need to hold both at the same
time<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.210> case<00:03:23.390> we're<00:03:23.600> just<00:03:23.720> going

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
time but in this case we're just going

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.530 
time but in this case we're just going
to<00:03:23.870> get<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.110> pretty<00:03:24.860> loose<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.520> is<00:03:25.640> these

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
to get it pretty loose as it is these

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.940 
to get it pretty loose as it is these
two<00:03:26.690> loosen<00:03:26.990> that<00:03:27.080> up<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.350> give<00:03:27.500> yourself<00:03:27.770> some

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
two loosen that up to give yourself some

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.740 
two loosen that up to give yourself some
room<00:03:28.210> same<00:03:29.210> thing<00:03:29.390> on<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.570> other<00:03:29.630> side

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
room same thing on the other side

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.960 
room same thing on the other side
exactly<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.040> same<00:03:31.330> but<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.580> do<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.820> up

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
exactly the same but you can do that up

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.490 
exactly the same but you can do that up
you<00:03:35.120> can<00:03:35.210> do<00:03:35.390> side<00:03:35.660> by<00:03:35.840> side<00:03:36.080> you're<00:03:36.320> going<00:03:36.410> to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you can do side by side you're going to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.680 
you can do side by side you're going to
flip<00:03:36.650> back<00:03:36.710> and<00:03:37.010> forth<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:38.060> once<00:03:38.510> we've<00:03:38.660> got

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
flip back and forth so once we've got

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.230 
flip back and forth so once we've got
that<00:03:38.930> front<00:03:39.170> one<00:03:39.320> loose<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:40.190> allows<00:03:40.700> us<00:03:41.000> to

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
that front one loose that allows us to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.770 
that front one loose that allows us to
manipulate<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.530> rear<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.330> case<00:03:44.570> we

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
manipulate the rear and in this case we

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.050 
manipulate the rear and in this case we
want<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.020> move<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.410> wheel<00:03:45.560> back<00:03:45.890> so<00:03:46.790> we<00:03:46.910> want

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
want to move the wheel back so we want

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.930 
want to move the wheel back so we want
to<00:03:47.150> throw<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:47.570> backwards<00:03:48.880> now<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
to throw this backwards now the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.510 
to throw this backwards now the
important<00:03:50.450> thing<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.720> note<00:03:50.900> here<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.520> your

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
important thing to note here is your

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.970 
important thing to note here is your
adjustment<00:03:53.030> marks<00:03:53.810> now<00:03:54.560> when<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:54.770> look<00:03:54.950> here

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
adjustment marks now when you look here

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.670 
adjustment marks now when you look here
you're<00:03:55.310> going<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.460> have<00:03:55.580> hashes<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:57.260> hashes

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
you're going to have hashes the hashes

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.000 
you're going to have hashes the hashes
are<00:03:57.710> there<00:03:57.950> not<00:03:58.989> for<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.050> reason<00:04:00.320> they<00:04:00.980> are

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
are there not for a reason they are

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.890 
are there not for a reason they are
there<00:04:01.310> for<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.520> reason<00:04:01.550> now<00:04:02.330> on<00:04:02.540> some<00:04:02.750> bikes

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
there for a reason now on some bikes

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.840 
there for a reason now on some bikes
you'll<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.470> on<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:04.130> actual<00:04:04.459> adjuster

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
you'll have on the actual adjuster

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.910 
you'll have on the actual adjuster
you'll<00:04:05.030> have<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.209> line<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.350> can<00:04:06.530> use<00:04:06.709> that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
you'll have a line and you can use that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.500 
you'll have a line and you can use that
that<00:04:07.550> line<00:04:07.790> that's<00:04:07.940> right<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.330> middle

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
that line that's right in the middle

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.120 
that line that's right in the middle
that's<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:09.050> line<00:04:09.380> up<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.739> make<00:04:09.920> an<00:04:10.040> adjustment

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
that's to line up and make an adjustment

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.660 
that's to line up and make an adjustment
so<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.510> want<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.750> take<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.900> note<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.550> go

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
so you want to take a note you can go

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.670 
so you want to take a note you can go
from<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> front<00:04:14.180> or<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.510> rear<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:15.320> going<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
from the front or the rear is going to

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.590 
from the front or the rear is going to
do<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:16.010> both<00:04:16.160> sides<00:04:16.220> what's<00:04:16.940> important<00:04:17.419> so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
do it on both sides what's important so

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.680 
do it on both sides what's important so
in<00:04:17.989> this<00:04:18.109> case<00:04:18.350> one<00:04:19.190> two<00:04:19.580> we're<00:04:20.060> dead<00:04:20.330> on<00:04:20.359> the

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
in this case one two we're dead on the

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.440 
in this case one two we're dead on the
third<00:04:20.720> mark<00:04:21.200> so<00:04:21.919> ideally<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:23.090> other<00:04:23.210> side

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
third mark so ideally the other side

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.070 
third mark so ideally the other side
would<00:04:23.570> be<00:04:23.690> dead<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.080> third<00:04:24.110> mark<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:26.150> it

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
would be dead on the third mark and it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.570 
would be dead on the third mark and it
is<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:29.210> considering<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:30.220> we'll<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:31.340> with

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
is so considering that we'll go with

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.390 
is so considering that we'll go with
half<00:04:31.760> half<00:04:32.540> adjustments<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:33.740> we'll<00:04:33.950> go<00:04:34.100> half

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
half half adjustments so we'll go half

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.590 
half half adjustments so we'll go half
way<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.910> we'll<00:04:35.360> move<00:04:35.540> this<00:04:35.780> entire<00:04:37.210> axle<00:04:38.210> just

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
way and we'll move this entire axle just

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.450 
way and we'll move this entire axle just
straight<00:04:38.750> back<00:04:38.960> half<00:04:39.560> an<00:04:39.740> adjustment<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.340> do

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
straight back half an adjustment and do

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.950 
straight back half an adjustment and do
it<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.640> other<00:04:40.760> side<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.600> see<00:04:41.750> where<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
it the other side and see where the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.040 
it the other side and see where the
tensions<00:04:42.350> out<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.040> they<00:04:43.160> have<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.340> do<00:04:43.990> go<00:04:44.990> to

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
tensions out so they have to do go to

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.140 
tensions out so they have to do go to
the<00:04:45.230> rear<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.850> start<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.240> loosen<00:04:47.570> that

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
the rear and start to loosen that

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.520 
the rear and start to loosen that
which<00:04:50.150> actually<00:04:50.539> pulls<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.900> chain<00:04:51.080> tight<00:04:51.349> as

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
which actually pulls the chain tight as

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.260 
which actually pulls the chain tight as
you<00:04:51.650> can<00:04:51.800> see<00:04:54.069> so<00:04:55.069> we've<00:04:55.219> done<00:04:55.370> three<00:04:55.669> turns<00:04:55.909> I

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
you can see so we've done three turns I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.140 
you can see so we've done three turns I
have<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.259> loop<00:04:57.499> very<00:04:57.770> much<00:04:58.009> but<00:04:58.340> you<00:04:58.879> can<00:04:58.939> see

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
have a loop very much but you can see

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.300 
have a loop very much but you can see
the<00:04:59.270> chain<00:04:59.479> making<00:05:00.169> some<00:05:00.289> adjustment<00:05:00.770> it's

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
the chain making some adjustment it's

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.519 
the chain making some adjustment it's
already<00:05:01.550> tightened<00:05:01.879> up<00:05:01.909> a<00:05:02.029> little<00:05:02.210> bit<00:05:02.529> so

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:03.529 
already tightened up a little bit so

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.290 
already tightened up a little bit so
that<00:05:03.560> four<00:05:03.979> turns<00:05:04.279> will<00:05:04.909> do<00:05:04.999> it<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> other

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
that four turns will do it to the other

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.200 
that four turns will do it to the other
side<00:05:05.449> real<00:05:05.840> quick<00:05:06.639> so<00:05:07.639> now<00:05:07.729> we've<00:05:07.909> made<00:05:08.029> the

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
side real quick so now we've made the

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.939 
side real quick so now we've made the
same<00:05:08.419> adjustment<00:05:09.169> on<00:05:09.229> both<00:05:09.259> sides<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.889> we

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
same adjustment on both sides and we

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.939 
same adjustment on both sides and we
just<00:05:10.129> want<00:05:10.279> to<00:05:10.400> check<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:10.969> chain<00:05:11.240> tension<00:05:11.949> and

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949 
just want to check the chain tension and

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.529 
just want to check the chain tension and
that's<00:05:13.310> right<00:05:13.610> about<00:05:13.849> where<00:05:13.909> we<00:05:14.180> want<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.389> be

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
that's right about where we want to be

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.209 
that's right about where we want to be
we've<00:05:14.810> taken<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.169> lot<00:05:15.319> of<00:05:15.469> slack<00:05:15.710> out<00:05:15.919> and

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
we've taken a lot of slack out and

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:18.219 
we've taken a lot of slack out and
remember<00:05:16.969> when<00:05:17.120> you<00:05:17.210> tighten<00:05:17.419> up<00:05:17.629> your<00:05:17.810> axle

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
remember when you tighten up your axle

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.899 
remember when you tighten up your axle
put<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.009> bike<00:05:19.159> back<00:05:19.340> down<00:05:19.580> it's<00:05:19.729> going<00:05:19.819> to

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
put the bike back down it's going to

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.820 
put the bike back down it's going to
tighten<00:05:20.090> up<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.419> little<00:05:20.449> bit<00:05:20.719> more<00:05:20.900> even<00:05:21.169> so<00:05:21.680> in

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
tighten up a little bit more even so in

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.439 
tighten up a little bit more even so in
some<00:05:22.009> cases<00:05:22.159> you<00:05:22.430> can<00:05:22.580> find<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:22.909> you<00:05:23.090> over

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
some cases you can find that you over

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.170 
some cases you can find that you over
tighten<00:05:23.629> and<00:05:24.229> I<00:05:24.319> have<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.830> reverses<00:05:25.699> process

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
tighten and I have the reverses process

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.860 
tighten and I have the reverses process
please<00:05:26.750> get<00:05:27.020> this<00:05:27.560> one<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:27.979> to<00:05:28.099> play<00:05:28.400> down<00:05:28.610> here

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
so we match you can count number of

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.700 
so we match you can count number of
turns<00:05:34.969> and<00:05:35.210> make<00:05:35.659> sure<00:05:35.840> your<00:05:36.050> adjustment

you're done you just want to tighten

you're done you just want to tighten
this<00:06:20.010> back<00:06:20.220> up<00:06:25.340> to<00:06:26.340> your<00:06:26.510> suggested<00:06:27.510> torque

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
this back up to your suggested torque

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.960 
this back up to your suggested torque
which<00:06:29.310> in<00:06:29.460> this<00:06:29.550> case<00:06:29.790> is<00:06:32.210> all<00:06:33.210> right<00:06:33.300> there

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
which in this case is all right there

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.180 
which in this case is all right there
check<00:06:35.970> your<00:06:36.060> tension<00:06:36.420> again<00:06:36.830> and<00:06:37.830> we're<00:06:37.980> still

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
check your tension again and we're still

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.120 
check your tension again and we're still
in<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.370> good<00:06:38.400> still<00:06:39.060> in<00:06:39.150> a<00:06:39.210> good<00:06:39.390> zone<00:06:39.600> there

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
in a good still in a good zone there

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.440 
in a good still in a good zone there
might<00:06:41.130> be<00:06:41.160> a<00:06:41.400> little<00:06:41.880> bit<00:06:42.090> on<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.240> tight<00:06:42.390> side

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
might be a little bit on the tight side

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.050 
might be a little bit on the tight side
but<00:06:43.940> it<00:06:44.940> will<00:06:45.090> loosen<00:06:45.240> up<00:06:46.250> slightly<00:06:47.250> as<00:06:47.670> you<00:06:47.730> go

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
but it will loosen up slightly as you go

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.430 
but it will loosen up slightly as you go
especially<00:06:48.420> in<00:06:48.690> the<00:06:48.750> condition<00:06:49.080> your<00:06:49.230> chain

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
especially in the condition your chain

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.200 
especially in the condition your chain
this<00:06:49.560> is<00:06:49.620> a<00:06:49.710> new<00:06:49.860> chain<00:06:50.100> still<00:06:50.400> so<00:06:50.640> it's<00:06:51.090> going

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
this is a new chain still so it's going

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.600 
this is a new chain still so it's going
to<00:06:51.270> loosen<00:06:51.570> a<00:06:51.600> little<00:06:51.630> bit<00:06:51.900> more<00:06:52.110> but<00:06:52.950> that's

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
to loosen a little bit more but that's

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.980 
to loosen a little bit more but that's
it<00:06:53.820> you<00:06:53.850> can<00:06:54.060> see<00:06:54.210> it<00:06:54.300> takes<00:06:54.450> just<00:06:54.690> a<00:06:54.810> few

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
it you can see it takes just a few

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.360 
it you can see it takes just a few
minutes<00:06:55.320> there's<00:06:55.530> only<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.740> few<00:06:55.890> adjustments

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
minutes there's only a few adjustments

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.160 
minutes there's only a few adjustments
you<00:06:56.460> need<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.670> make<00:06:56.850> real<00:06:57.600> simple<00:06:57.930> and<00:06:58.050> easy

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
you need to make real simple and easy

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.290 
you need to make real simple and easy
and<00:06:58.350> quick<00:06:58.640> so<00:06:59.640> there<00:06:59.760> you<00:06:59.850> go<00:06:59.970> you're<00:07:00.180> ready

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
and quick so there you go you're ready

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.470 
and quick so there you go you're ready
to<00:07:00.450> hit<00:07:00.540> the<00:07:00.630> road<00:07:00.810> with<00:07:00.990> a<00:07:01.050> tight<00:07:01.230> chain
