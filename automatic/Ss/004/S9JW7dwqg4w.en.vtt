00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.370

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.870
 they just can not install it by 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.780
 skin and I only see two files one 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.670
 people who can not install it and for 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.039

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.180
 five seconds that appears here 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.120
 then we will give you in jump advertising and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 the skin file will appear 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.400
 for example this x is that in 2013 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 someone you sell me 7 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.229
 to download it we will simply give it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.840
 in download you do not need to login 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.450
 precisely and they started the download 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.189
 we give in save and automatically 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.740
 will start the download does not weigh much 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.299
 started around a mega and a half and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.670
 for people who can not 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.069
 installing it is very simple it does not have 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 no this installer simply here 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.219
 we give you show in folder 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.799
 and we copied the weird file that brought us down 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.460
 without decompressing it hear well without 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.479
 unzip it we give you copy 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.210
 we go to my virtual documents we 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.320
 let's skins and here simply what 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.210
 we hit the same as it is as we had 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.070
 downloaded without decompressing what I 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.880
 this comes out because I have to give it 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.880
 replace 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.040
 and then we have the good skin for 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.050
 look for it in the virtual and I think this 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 I had already explained several times but what 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 I will explain again for the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.800
 people who are still starting with the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.960
 virtual and well opened our virtual 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.620
 since we had opened we are going in 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.830
 skins configurations and we look for the one that 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.410
 we had downloaded 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.750
 for example that exists is that in 2013 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.090
 someone and it will automatically change us 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.270
 in our virtual and that simple and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.780
 simple we can install them without 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.560
 no installer or something without 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 unzip it hear well without 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 unzip it good that's the video 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 answer to all the people who do not 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.380
 they could download or they could not 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.840
 install the file in your virtual and the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.880
 that this is not the video we do not see each other 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.150
