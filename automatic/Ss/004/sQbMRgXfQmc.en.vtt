00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
 they are welcome greets you rock 21 with 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.470
 his ninth video 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 in this opportunity we will take a look at 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 the theory of cancer operation of the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.009
 kn series of neighborhood boys les 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.110
 I remember that these theories are made 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.850
 by the fans of these series or by 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.550
 Some Internet user with a little time 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.920
 free that's why they fall into the category of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 urban legends since they are made 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.970
 by people completely oblivious to the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.769
 production equipment of the series without 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.769

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.470

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.420
 success of the superpowerful girls the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.430
 company launched a kind of contest 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.710
 I remember that it was sending a letter with the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.079

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.239

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.660

 flying towards the USA when arriving at the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.630
 cartoon network companies I found 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.670
 with the security guards we 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.190
 They took my father and me to the office 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.140
 of the president we arrived and the guard 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.080

 for winning the contest and answer me 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.260
 you want to know about all cartoon network not 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.510
 I knew that question was much that 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.820
 I wanted to know but it always occurred to me 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.950
 I wanted to know where they got the idea from 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.930
 the neighborhood kids the face of 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.150
 President changed suddenly then 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.260
 He asked that all but me leave the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 room 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.760
 then the president says luckily 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 we almost finished the series I can already 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.620
 tell this to someone but please 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.450
 keep the secret I answered that I was 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.000
 well and the only thing that the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.790
 president went well then he got up 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.740
 he opened a drawer behind him pulled out some 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 papers and he gave them to me and he told me that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.630
 read one by one and take my 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.760
 time so I read them one by one what 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.680
 first thing I noticed was that each one was a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.600
 different episode of the guys from the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.970
 neighborhood but the weirdest was the last 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.130
 paper that I found that had as its name 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.230
 cancer operation was very rare there 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.290
 I remembered an episode with that name and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.840
 I read it this is what it said January 10 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.820
 of 2008 I have felt very good in these 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.569
 days I think I 've finally beaten the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.180
 Cancer 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.400
 I have already received many visits, gifts and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.769
 also letters of encouragement from my 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.959
 parents and friends I think my team and I 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.090
 We have finally triumphed 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.430
 rest from my mission I do not know why the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.829
 doctors keep me locked up here already 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.840
 I feel better and I want to go out I want 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.430
 live the adventures that I wrote my 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.250
 parents do not want to tell me because 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.469
 I continue here I ask the president 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.180
 what were these papers and he told me 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.730
 you wanted the origin of the boys of 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.819
 neighborhood now that you know this already 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.930
 I can tell the true story 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.849
 we needed a new story to 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.129
 to keep our channel afloat 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.349
 we were desperate then 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.780
 we found the story of this young man at 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.209
 read his experiences that he had written 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.579
 we realized that he had cancer 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.699
 Heart no longer gave much hope 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.560
 of life but he had imagination he created 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.750
 each of the tom warburton stories 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.939
 I thought we would do a series that 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.889
 will include as protagonist we had to 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.680
 make many changes to be able to 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.870
 showing her to the children her team were the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 only true characters was his 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.230
 single family that made them at their age to 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.349
 who could live 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.269
 with number two was his father he could 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.970
 invent anything you want 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.060
 number five was his mother was who else 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.340
 he looked after him and protected number three was his 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.989
 sister was very affectionate with him she 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.300
 gave away one of his most possessions 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.729
 valuable was a stuffed animal 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 ape with many spots of colors he 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.229
 he named it a rainbow ape 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.720
 and number four was the boyfriend of number 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.360
 three became attached to him after living 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.490
 with him he wished they would never grow up 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.590
 but they would lose childhood and 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.660
 they would end the adventures why never 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.760
 they passed their fifteen years 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.340
 relatives followed suit for 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.440
 motivate him to continue living some 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.229
 villains are your emotions the same 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.539
 disease we invented them we went 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.090
 a change we made to show 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.310
 history and did not want me to know more 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.550
 I went from there I took the writing with me 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.590
 and I went back to my house then on the 21st 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.410
 January the last episode of 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.539
 the series called operation story and there 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.030
 I realized that everything that the 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.590
 president of cartoon network embona va 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.200
 perfectly at last 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.150
 to the parents and sister of the child counting 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.000
 his last adventure as a family as 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.190
 team in that chapter showed a 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.200
 way a little more understandable death 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.690
 of number one the cancer had it 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.580
 born he had died for that all his 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.250
 team says goodbye like he did his 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.480
 family in real life could not help 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.450
 drop the tears 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.240
 this episode had another meaning for me 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.860
 even though I never met number one what 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.530
 I estimate a lot 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.780
 a very interesting story and at the same time 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.419
 a little sad what is implied 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.610
 In my opinion, it is the struggle with which 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.650
 a child can imagine to be saved from 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.569
 a terrible disease think about 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.310
 this and other theories about boys 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.979
 of the neighborhood and create their own criteria 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.979
 with this I say goodbye until next time
