first three studs so that's all I like
to<00:04:01.470> think<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:06.360> then

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
to think of it just like that and then

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.410 
to think of it just like that and then
you<00:04:07.200> take<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:09.030> take<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.450> 1<00:04:09.990> by<00:04:10.230> 6<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.420> you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
you take you take that 1 by 6 and you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.949 
you take you take that 1 by 6 and you
put<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.170> second<00:04:13.860> one<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.300> it's<00:04:15.570> like

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
put it on this second one so it's like

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.840 
put it on this second one so it's like
this<00:04:18.170> sometimes<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.620> falls<00:04:19.799> out<00:04:20.040> easily<00:04:20.310> so

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
this sometimes it falls out easily so

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.090 
this sometimes it falls out easily so
because<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.420> string<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.770> like<00:04:23.070> to
