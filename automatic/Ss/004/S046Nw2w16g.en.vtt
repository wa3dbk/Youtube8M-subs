see<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:57.069> qualifying<00:01:58.069> day<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.460> even<00:01:58.609> on<00:01:58.789> fourth

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
see as qualifying day and even on fourth

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
see as qualifying day and even on fourth
one<00:01:59.270> day<00:01:59.450> we<00:01:59.569> don't<00:01:59.719> know<00:01:59.869> for<00:02:00.049> race<00:02:00.259> day<00:02:00.289> as<00:02:00.770> we

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
one day we don't know for race day as we

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.669 
one day we don't know for race day as we
saw<00:02:01.069> last<00:02:01.100> year<00:02:01.609> Honda<00:02:02.569> rocked<00:02:02.780> up<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.439> lot

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
saw last year Honda rocked up and a lot

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.789 
saw last year Honda rocked up and a lot
more<00:02:03.829> power<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:05.659> can<00:02:06.140> probably<00:02:06.469> expect

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
more power so you can probably expect

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.280 
more power so you can probably expect
that<00:02:06.979> again
