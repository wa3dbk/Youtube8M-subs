you're just going to come around and
pull<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.150> tight<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.930> make<00:02:29.530> sure<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.950> on

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
pull it tight and make sure it's on

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.130 
pull it tight and make sure it's on
there<00:02:30.130> flat<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.030> check<00:02:31.390> make<00:02:31.720> sure<00:02:31.750> there's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
there flat and check make sure there's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.500 
there flat and check make sure there's
no<00:02:32.890> big<00:02:33.310> bumps<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:34.060> no<00:02:34.420> guessing<00:02:36.450> okay<00:02:37.450> so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
no big bumps there's no guessing okay so

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.330 
no big bumps there's no guessing okay so
this<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> regular<00:02:38.489> electrical<00:02:39.489> tape<00:02:41.340> I'm

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
this is a regular electrical tape I'm

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.280 
this is a regular electrical tape I'm
really<00:02:42.670> bad<00:02:42.940> about<00:02:43.120> using<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.810> my<00:02:43.900> horses

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
really bad about using it on my horses

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.440 
really bad about using it on my horses
but<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:44.920> helps<00:02:45.400> keep<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> pole<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.209> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
but it really helps keep the pole on and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.860 
but it really helps keep the pole on and
make<00:02:46.569> sure<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.870> velcro<00:02:47.049> doesn't<00:02:47.500> come<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.799> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
make sure the velcro doesn't come up I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.069 
make sure the velcro doesn't come up I
stick<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.079> onto<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:51.340> velcro<00:02:52.209> park<00:02:52.690> that's

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
stick it onto the velcro park that's

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.740 
stick it onto the velcro park that's
easy<00:02:53.319> is<00:02:53.530> pretty<00:02:53.799> sick<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.489> then<00:02:55.239> pull<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
easy is pretty sick and then pull it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.809 
easy is pretty sick and then pull it
around<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.349> don't<00:02:56.769> want<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.069> tighten<00:02:57.670> it

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
around you don't want to tighten it

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.580 
around you don't want to tighten it
because<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.569> want<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.780> make<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> tight<00:02:59.260> spot<00:02:59.470> on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
because you want to make a tight spot on

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.660 
because you want to make a tight spot on
the<00:02:59.680> pillow<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.480> stretchy<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.260> it

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
the pillow but it is stretchy so it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.320 
the pillow but it is stretchy so it
doesn't<00:03:03.670> get

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.990 

okay<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.950> beak<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.520> front

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
okay so this is the beak on the front

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.479 
okay so this is the beak on the front
you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.150> see<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.540> Center<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.200> even<00:03:17.069> both

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you can see it Center and even both

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.750 
you can see it Center and even both
sides<00:03:17.849> go<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.200> same<00:03:19.410> angle<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.130> come

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
sides go about the same angle and come

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.830 
sides go about the same angle and come
up<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.090> both<00:03:21.690> layers<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.380> even<00:03:22.680> also<00:03:23.840> okay

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
up and both layers or even also okay

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.620 
up and both layers or even also okay
these<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.260> ripples<00:03:25.709> on<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.010> bottom<00:03:26.630> I'm

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
these little ripples on the bottom I'm

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.390 
these little ripples on the bottom I'm
getting<00:03:27.959> them<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.349> these<00:03:28.530> polos<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.190> think

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
getting them on these polos I think

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.699 
getting them on these polos I think
because<00:03:29.730> they're<00:03:29.760> thinner<00:03:30.150> thicker<00:03:30.900> polos<00:03:31.380> on

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
because they're thinner thicker polos on

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.680 
because they're thinner thicker polos on
a<00:03:31.769> special<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.610> different<00:03:32.790> horse<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.300> don't

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
a special and different horse and don't

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.360 
a special and different horse and don't
get<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.620> everything<00:03:34.980> else<00:03:35.130> should<00:03:35.220> be

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
get that so everything else should be

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.199 
get that so everything else should be
smooth<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.060> even<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> spacing<00:03:38.819> here<00:03:39.030> is

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
smooth and even the spacing here is

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.550 
smooth and even the spacing here is
really<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.660> depend<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:39.930> how<00:03:39.989> long<00:03:40.349> your

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
really going to depend on how long your

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.440 
really going to depend on how long your
pillows<00:03:40.950> are<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.400> how<00:03:41.550> long<00:03:41.819> your<00:03:41.970> personal<00:03:42.360> I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
pillows are and how long your personal I

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.380 
pillows are and how long your personal I
do<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:46.440> there<00:03:46.650> we<00:03:46.769> have<00:03:46.799> our<00:03:47.280> nicely<00:03:48.239> wrapped

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
do so there we have our nicely wrapped

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.900 
do so there we have our nicely wrapped
pulao
