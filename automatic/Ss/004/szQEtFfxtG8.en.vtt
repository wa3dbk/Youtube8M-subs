happened I can't delete them or anything

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
happened I can't delete them or anything
so<00:00:34.280> hopefully<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.370> figure<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.789> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so hopefully I can figure what I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.160 
so hopefully I can figure what I
happened<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.629> it<00:00:36.930> kind<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
happened out there because it kind of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
happened out there because it kind of
makes<00:00:37.289> everything<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.739> crazy<00:00:38.039> because<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
makes everything all crazy because I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.239 
makes everything all crazy because I
can't<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.989> can't<00:00:40.170> keep<00:00:41.039> things

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
can't you know I can't keep things

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.009 
can't you know I can't keep things
straight<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.819> that's<00:00:42.329> kind<00:00:42.569> of<00:00:42.600> my<00:00:42.690> problem

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
straight so that's kind of my problem

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:44.540 
straight so that's kind of my problem
right<00:00:43.109> now<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.800> i'll<00:00:43.859> figure<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.399> don't

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
right now but i'll figure it out don't

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.939 
right now but i'll figure it out don't
worry<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:44.999> also<00:00:45.870> let's<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.589> back<00:00:46.679> to<00:00:46.769> the<00:00:46.829> map

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
worry and also let's get back to the map

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:47.930 
worry and also let's get back to the map
now<00:00:46.979> all<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.579> called<00:00:47.789> bounce

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
now all right so it's called bounce

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.329 
now all right so it's called bounce
lounge<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.589> this<00:00:49.589> is<00:00:49.739> called<00:00:49.949> bounce<00:00:50.100> lounge

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
lounge and this is called bounce lounge

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.950 
lounge and this is called bounce lounge
because<00:00:50.609> while<00:00:50.999> you're<00:00:51.149> bouncing<00:00:51.479> around<00:00:51.569> on

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
because while you're bouncing around on

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.649 
because while you're bouncing around on
the<00:00:52.139> shield<00:00:52.440> doors<00:00:52.909> they<00:00:53.909> get<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> game<00:00:54.479> type

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
the shield doors they get the game type

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.299 
the shield doors they get the game type
forward<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.139> called<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.499> rocket<00:00:55.829> tunnel<00:00:55.979> rain

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
forward is called a rocket tunnel rain

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
forward is called a rocket tunnel rain
that's<00:00:56.999> because<00:00:57.479> its<00:00:57.749> internal<00:00:58.350> rain<00:00:58.559> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that's because its internal rain of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
that's because its internal rain of
rockets<00:00:59.329> basically<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.479> a<00:01:00.539> bottomless<00:01:00.870> clip

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
rockets basically of a bottomless clip

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
rockets basically of a bottomless clip
which<00:01:01.710> means<00:01:02.010> you're<00:01:02.159> constantly<00:01:02.609> launching

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
which means you're constantly launching

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.240 
which means you're constantly launching
rockets<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:04.260> each<00:01:04.440> other<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.860> grenades

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rockets at each other you have grenades

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.700 
rockets at each other you have grenades
but<00:01:05.610> um<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.120> is<00:01:06.299> mainly<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.140> rockets

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
but um you know is mainly for rockets

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.930 
but um you know is mainly for rockets
and<00:01:07.920> you're<00:01:08.010> constantly<00:01:08.340> launching<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
and you're constantly launching your

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.730 
and you're constantly launching your
rocks<00:01:09.120> at<00:01:09.299> each<00:01:09.330> other<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.870> it's<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
rocks at each other and it's kind of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
rocks at each other and it's kind of
chaotic<00:01:11.039> it's<00:01:11.909> meant<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.329> two<00:01:12.719> to<00:01:12.840> eight

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
chaotic it's meant for two to eight

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
chaotic it's meant for two to eight
players<00:01:13.310> but<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.399> can<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> 16<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.329> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
players but you can go up the 16 if you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's reason why it's been four to eight

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
it's reason why it's been four to eight
players<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.399> well<00:01:20.579> you<00:01:21.509> know<00:01:21.539> if<00:01:21.750> you

give up the 16 it's kind of crazy like

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.029 
give up the 16 it's kind of crazy like
if<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.479> pilot<00:01:24.869> even<00:01:25.200> work<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.500> 16<00:01:25.799> players
