against<00:00:58.679> this<00:00:58.829> team<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.639> my<00:00:59.760> formation

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
against this team I think my formation

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.360 
against this team I think my formation
will<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:01.109> well<00:01:01.319> as<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> center

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
will do well as I do have the center

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.259 
will do well as I do have the center
attack<00:01:02.549> admit<00:01:02.819> that<00:01:02.940> could<00:01:03.120> penetrate

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
attack admit that could penetrate

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.190 
attack admit that could penetrate
between<00:01:03.899> his<00:01:04.320> defense<00:01:04.910> but<00:01:05.910> um<00:01:06.090> let's<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:06.960> how

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
between his defense but um let's see how

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100 
between his defense but um let's see how
we<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.040> game<00:01:08.360> hopefully<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.960> can

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we get on in this game hopefully we can

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
we get on in this game hopefully we can
pull<00:01:10.350> off<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> result<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> getting<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.160> last

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
