00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
players and stuff and the first trick is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.209 
players and stuff and the first trick is
how<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.359> alternate<00:00:30.960> between<00:00:30.990> targets<00:00:31.769> with

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
how to alternate between targets with

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.520 
how to alternate between targets with
the<00:00:32.399> buzzards<00:00:32.910> lock-on<00:00:33.690> system<00:00:33.989> i'm<00:00:34.290> sure

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the buzzards lock-on system i'm sure

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
the buzzards lock-on system i'm sure
this<00:00:34.680> would<00:00:34.829> work<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.190> jets<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:35.640> well<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.420> as

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
this would work with jets as well but as

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
this would work with jets as well but as
the<00:00:36.809> Buzzard<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> more<00:00:37.590> stationary<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the Buzzard is more stationary in the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.540 
the Buzzard is more stationary in the
air<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.420> easier<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
air it's a lot easier to do so as you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
air it's a lot easier to do so as you
can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> I've<00:00:42.059> got<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.329> Rockets<00:00:42.629> equipped

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
can see I've got the Rockets equipped

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.900 
can see I've got the Rockets equipped
and<00:00:43.200> normally<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.399> aim

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and normally you have to like aim

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
and normally you have to like aim
someone<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> actually<00:00:45.930> lock<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.440> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
someone for it to actually lock on but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
someone for it to actually lock on but
if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> press<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.219> left<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.640> right<00:00:47.670> bumper

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
if you press the left and right bumper

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.880 
if you press the left and right bumper
you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> actually<00:00:48.899> alternate<00:00:49.469> between<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you can actually alternate between the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.279 
you can actually alternate between the
targets<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.520> locks<00:00:50.760> onto<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.960> only<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
targets and locks onto and it's only a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.510 
targets and locks onto and it's only a
small<00:00:52.559> trick<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.460> very

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
small trick bit is actually very

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160 
small trick bit is actually very
beneficial<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.629> me<00:00:54.780> fighting<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
beneficial as you see me fighting the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
beneficial as you see me fighting the
cops<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.850> few

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
cops you see me do it here in a few

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.520 
cops you see me do it here in a few
seconds<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> turn<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> right<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
seconds when I turn to the right a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
seconds when I turn to the right a
little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.489> which<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> switching

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.759> bullet<00:01:29.939> hole<00:01:30.090> went<00:01:30.329> on

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can see that a bullet hole went on

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
you can see that a bullet hole went on
to<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> fence<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.610> can

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
to this fence right here and you can

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
to this fence right here and you can
just<00:01:32.759> keep<00:01:32.880> doing<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> over<00:01:33.720> again

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
just keep doing this over and over again

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 
just keep doing this over and over again
so<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> try<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.920> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> shotgun<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.729> here

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
so I try it with the shotgun right here

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.010 
so I try it with the shotgun right here
and<00:01:36.030> you'll<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> fence<00:01:36.720> panel

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and you'll see that the fence panel

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.929 
and you'll see that the fence panel
actually<00:01:37.259> blows<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.549> proof<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
actually blows off so this is proof that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
actually blows off so this is proof that
the<00:01:39.299> bullets<00:01:39.570> actually<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:40.049> fire<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the bullets actually do fire out of your

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.899 
the bullets actually do fire out of your
gun<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:41.310> doing<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
gun when you're doing this and if you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.609 
gun when you're doing this and if you
look<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.210> top<00:01:42.479> right<00:01:42.689> hand<00:01:42.810> corner<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
look to the top right hand corner you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.260 
look to the top right hand corner you
can<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.159> am<00:01:44.310> shooting<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.729> few<00:01:44.939> bullets

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
can see that I am shooting a few bullets

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149 
can see that I am shooting a few bullets
it<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.259> difficult<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.829> shoot<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it can be a bit difficult to shoot the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.160 
it can be a bit difficult to shoot the
people<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> practice

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
people but with a little bit of practice

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
people but with a little bit of practice
and<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> luck<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:50.009> well<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.340> should<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and a bit of luck as well you should be

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.670 
and a bit of luck as well you should be
able<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:52.110> easy<00:01:52.320> trick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
able to do it but it's a nice easy trick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.050 
able to do it but it's a nice easy trick
so<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> were<00:01:53.189> getting<00:01:53.310> shot<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.790> or<00:01:53.939> if

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so if you were getting shot at or if

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
so if you were getting shot at or if
your<00:01:54.390> friends<00:01:54.659> were<00:01:54.750> getting<00:01:54.990> shot<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.380> then

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
your friends were getting shot at then

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.429 
your friends were getting shot at then
you<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> able<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.700> blind<00:01:57.420> fire<00:01:57.780> you'd<00:01:58.290> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you would be able to blind fire you'd be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.600 
you would be able to blind fire you'd be
able<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.680> stay<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.890> covering<00:01:59.340> you'd<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.520> able

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
able to stay in covering you'd be able

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.219 
able to stay in covering you'd be able
to<00:01:59.700> switch<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.240> shoot<00:02:00.450> without<00:02:00.630> even<00:02:00.960> reveal

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to switch and shoot without even reveal

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.240 
to switch and shoot without even reveal
yourselves<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> last<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:03.090> comes<00:02:03.659> from

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250
