00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
four and can go up to twelve so how they

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.939

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.200 
although if it was in the future and it
was<00:01:56.189> previous<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.759> still<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> future

regardless<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.430> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
regardless we don't really know the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
regardless we don't really know the
motivations<00:02:00.329> behind<00:02:00.450> what<00:02:00.840> happened<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.409> just

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
motivations behind what happened we just

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
motivations behind what happened we just
know<00:02:01.799> what<00:02:01.979> happened<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:03.090> really

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
