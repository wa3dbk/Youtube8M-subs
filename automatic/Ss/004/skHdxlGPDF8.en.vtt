00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.070
 I am no further move Schiphol airport oliver media is only check in the kiosk 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.970
 trace of that internet after the check in processors that you can capture 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.330
 because good luck you are there to break but now do not want to be by this 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.519
 the meeting was properly approached 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.309
 we are even further down on machines but this user for passengers 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.970
 Have checked in at home at four o'clock 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.609
 so that they themselves can also provide their own security for one 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.859
 faster flow from us 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.730
 I have just put purchased aside 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.080
 they tried to deliver themselves 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.390
 in the first instance it didn't go well in the second instance it did 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.970
 and it's actually pretty handy for the passengers 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.120
 a very good steering they can be a logical step in the future besides but 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.710
 in the internet traffic in check and through the kiosk they see it as a real like 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.970
 a next step to be in control of their own home 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.260
 from left to right parties like machines were the Schiphol airport 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.070
 that justice has peace 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.120
 local prosperity 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 in the machine 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.470
 we get the home screen 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.150
 then I have to know with the barcode of the boarding pass but it can be an ordinary one 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.970
 boarding pass and internet nice pass or the barcode on the mobile phone 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 we do have a red light 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 then it can check whether the data is correct 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.000
 kkr security questions 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 the label comes from the machine 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.800
 get that lee head out 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.520
 please note that it will stick together 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.970
 all you have to do 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.970
 is the end to do 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 are we done 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.450
 it is checked whether the label is correctly placed on the case 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.180
 We get the question if I can check someone else because I have three more 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.180
 kilo of government right now that is an ep 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.390
 the baggage is handling get job baggage proof from the device 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 and I keep it for other travel documents 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.479
 dr 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.799
 of course a lot easier 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.930
 only thinkers who do it more often make it even easier but I think it is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.549
 be nice actually 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.039
 that is, of course, it will be there 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:25.039
 expect the invention but did fine 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.109
 she stood doing 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.109
 very very sad the castle left back slightly occurs 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.849
