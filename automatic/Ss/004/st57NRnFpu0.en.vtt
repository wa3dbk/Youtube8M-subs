00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:06.509
 it's true when something will happen to the ability to understand how it works 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.779
 according to the magic 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:09.789
 and that is 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.789
 precisely what the ipad does 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.420
 it is difficult to understand how something so simple so delicate ica lightweight 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.319
 It can be so capable 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.410
 the iphone was a revolution we already asked so much of him 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.999
 slaty so many new technologies the applications the interfaces 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.590
 it was really 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.920
 an innovative product and we wanted to overcome that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.870
 and apply it to all a product new cases the altar is the best experience 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.450
 to browse the internet to watch photos and movies 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 if it's going to change the way we do the things we do all the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.810
 days the face of the product is defined if like a car 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.440
 perazzo multitouch glass castle 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.830
 there is no guidance I do not know 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.030
 there is no right or wrong way for noise 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 not change me 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 to adjust to the products product fit 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.000
 we looked at the device if we decided that we could 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 redesign it you must imagine to rebuild 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 each of the applications 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.760
 and adapt it specifically to the ipad this 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.730
 we could improve it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.860
 not just a little bit more without a magnitude 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.870
 much larger 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 the altar is the best way to surf the internet 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.440
 It's like having a magazine or a book or newspaper in your hands 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.030
 is having internet in your hands as you navigate 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.440
 and with a screen that size 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.270
 you can see more 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.710
 from Internet 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.920
 particularly for example 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 on Wednesday we can see all the stories 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.889
 and if we see something 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.269
 we do not touch 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.379
 and it gets bigger you do not even have to think about it 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.379
 you just do it 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.469
 on the list 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.730
 It also gives me possibilities functionalities immediately 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:30.089
 you can see and belts and month very quickly and in a funny way 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.389
 because he does it with your own hands 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.959
 you can use the keyboard 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.660
 to write one and a half 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.450
 6 this keyboard before almost the same size as that of a we by 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.409
 example 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.669
 If they want 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:50.189
 we want to see a photograph in a weather team showed tarlovsky so we can 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.189
 We concentrate on the content that interests us 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.110
 in list 3 the best way to see and share photos 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 you can see all the albums 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.319
 they 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.369
 8 yes you can this expensive to enlarge ap 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.969
 today and so to be able to see all the photographs they want to share with 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.930
 friends 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.730
 they just do not turn 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.080
 and on the ipad it automatically adjusts the photograph the correct orientation 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.059
 this is an amazing site type to watch videos 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.799
 the sportsfans 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.839
 face of users these very credible 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.459
 when we see something we touch it 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.039
 we started to give no 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.409
 the quality of the video is amazing 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.249
 we doubled 2 we played twice 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.399
 it stops 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.430
 also has a very good application to read more peace that is very fast 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.669
 and there is also an application 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.669
 for german darÃ­o as never seen before 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.439
 another thing that we are excited about that country bush 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.559
 you can read books that is really a pleasure 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.519
 but not only can you read the books 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.389
 but it also turns 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.940
 and reveals a whole library of costumes to 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.830
 and with the finger you can buy and download books immediately begin 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.229
 to read them 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.460
 in this way we have three bulls in him there are parents l addictions the of the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.830
 applications and now that's where it worked 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.740
 in it attentive payet 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.150
 does not fall more than 240 nil 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.259
 applications that are available and can be loaded on it there are parents 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.259
 then all the ways can be used 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.120
 we can play 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.999
 there are so many 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.339
 and also the developers are going to be doing specific applications 

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.449
 for the ipad 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.009
 so it's going to be a whole new range of applications for the iphone 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.819
 the ipad 2 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
 this most advanced technology with which I have worked 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.309
 the product innovator starts with this multi-touch function 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.919
 is the most advanced that has been included in a product and in this size this 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:22.759
 really we 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.669
 realizes the power 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.349
 represents 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.330
 two 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.789
 having both sensors in this design 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.289
 The huila precises bel the multi-touch functionary is 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.289
 amazing 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.419
 p 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.990
 I think our fifth experience of our clients with this is going to be 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.059
 amazing 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:53.509
 Holds an artist and ld act functionality shown 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.300
 in the screen display 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.319
 this is a technology based in irun that not only provides a great 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.379
 experience on the device 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.299
 if not also when sharing the device with another person 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.510
 the answer 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.639
 of this device is so good and you can really feel how it works 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.320
 and that has to do 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.570
 for the silicon that rose mons for 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.930
 on the ipad 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.159
 then to pink by a specialized team improves 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:30.070
 the performance 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.070
 in a way that I can understand imaginable 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.809
 also allows the battery to run all day 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.509
 has the battery technology of the software 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.509
 and with all this together 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.509
 we put them together in a way that other people could not do 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.219
 one of the most important characteristics of the design of the daughter that 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:59.689
 is 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.680
 Usually when you have the new technologies that starts a very price 

00:07:04.679 --> 00:07:05.460
 high 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.300
 and as more accessible decrease 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.330
 we wanted to do it in a different agile way 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.730
 we wanted to take this technology 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.099
 very advanced all this software 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.199
 and make frost 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.509
 to hands in the mass amount of people possible 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.149
 the discharge starts 499 and this is very exciting 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.129
 links the father on the one hand 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:32.729
 this is much bigger than a new product is a new category without 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.499
 But missions and millions of people are going to feel solidarity with him 

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.879
 to know how to use it 

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:44.159
 this defines many ways our vision and our sense of what I say
