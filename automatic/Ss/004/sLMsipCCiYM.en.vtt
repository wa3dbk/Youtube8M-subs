00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
it was cutting edge that most people

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.680 
it was cutting edge that most people
didn't<00:00:10.759> even<00:00:10.910> know<00:00:11.000> what<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:11.269> internet<00:00:11.660> was

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690

back then when I first got on the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.150 
back then when I first got on the
internet<00:00:14.030> I<00:00:14.389> actually<00:00:15.049> was<00:00:15.440> able<00:00:15.589> to<00:00:15.830> surf

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
evening so you can imagine how cool

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.910 
evening so you can imagine how cool
Steve<00:00:20.359> chambers<00:00:20.960> thought<00:00:21.260> it<00:00:21.410> was<00:00:21.590> when<00:00:21.800> he

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
Steve chambers thought it was when he

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.960 
Steve chambers thought it was when he
got<00:00:22.100> that<00:00:22.340> first<00:00:22.609> web<00:00:23.180> cam<00:00:23.539> 15<00:00:24.439> years<00:00:24.830> ago<00:00:25.220> he

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
got that first web cam 15 years ago he

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.160 
got that first web cam 15 years ago he
just<00:00:26.180> had<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.330> figure<00:00:26.510> out<00:00:26.689> what<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:26.990> do<00:00:27.140> with

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
just had to figure out what to do with

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.200 
just had to figure out what to do with
it<00:00:27.380> they<00:00:27.619> came<00:00:27.830> up<00:00:27.859> with<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.220> idea<00:00:28.429> well<00:00:29.029> what

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
it they came up with this idea well what

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.660 
it they came up with this idea well what
could<00:00:29.359> I<00:00:29.420> do<00:00:29.599> that<00:00:30.230> would<00:00:30.439> show<00:00:30.679> some<00:00:31.009> motion

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
could I do that would show some motion

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.570 
could I do that would show some motion
over<00:00:32.540> time<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.350> what<00:00:33.530> better<00:00:33.770> way<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.040> do<00:00:34.340> that

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
over time and what better way to do that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.840 
over time and what better way to do that
than<00:00:36.700> with<00:00:37.700> an<00:00:38.330> ant<00:00:38.750> farm<00:00:39.130> one<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.250> those<00:00:40.370> uncle

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
than with an ant farm one of those uncle

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.690 
than with an ant farm one of those uncle
milton's<00:00:41.360> ant<00:00:41.750> farms<00:00:42.170> he<00:00:42.320> had<00:00:42.530> as<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.740> kid<00:00:43.010> uncle

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.990 
milton uncle milton yeah Milton Levine
he<00:00:47.990> invented<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.470> ant<00:00:48.710> farm<00:00:48.980> in<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.220> mid<00:00:49.490> 50

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
he invented the ant farm in the mid 50

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300 
he invented the ant farm in the mid 50
then<00:00:50.300> there<00:00:50.510> was<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.900> 40<00:00:51.710> years<00:00:52.010> later

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
then there was the 40 years later

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.730 
then there was the 40 years later
putting<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:53.330> on<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.660> newfangled<00:00:54.230> interweb

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
putting one on that newfangled interweb

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.730 
putting one on that newfangled interweb
thingy<00:00:55.550> in<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.060> very<00:00:56.240> stop-motion<00:00:56.930> sort<00:00:57.470> of<00:00:57.560> way

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
thingy in a very stop-motion sort of way

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.950 
thingy in a very stop-motion sort of way
originally<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.640> wasn't<00:00:59.060> streaming<00:00:59.570> video<00:00:59.900> I

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
originally it wasn't streaming video I

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.750 
originally it wasn't streaming video I
think<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.530> best<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:00.890> could<00:01:01.040> do<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.340> an<00:01:01.430> update

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
think the best we could do is an update

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.670 
think the best we could do is an update
to<00:01:01.790> picture<00:01:02.300> every<00:01:02.570> minute<00:01:02.960> or<00:01:03.050> something<00:01:03.560> it

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
to picture every minute or something it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.470 
to picture every minute or something it
was<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> real<00:01:04.100> pain<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.400> actually<00:01:05.030> get<00:01:05.239> those

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
was a real pain to actually get those

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.170 
was a real pain to actually get those
images<00:01:05.810> online<00:01:06.140> too<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:07.040> would<00:01:07.340> dial<00:01:07.610> into

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
images online too I would dial into

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.970 
images online too I would dial into
seattle<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:08.960> distance<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.680> get<00:01:09.770> on<00:01:09.890> the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
seattle on distance to get on the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.410 
seattle on distance to get on the
internet<00:01:10.280> you've<00:01:10.550> been<00:01:10.760> hit<00:01:10.880> what<00:01:11.060> like<00:01:11.330> the
