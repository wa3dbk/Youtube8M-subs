fine
it<00:02:28.740> also<00:02:28.980> has<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> 2.5<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:31.650> phone<00:02:31.920> jack<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
it also has a 2.5 and my phone jack so

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.180 
it also has a 2.5 and my phone jack so
you<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.320> plug<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.470> microphone<00:02:34.590> there

you can plug in your microphone there

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.150 
you can plug in your microphone there
just<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> regular<00:02:36.870> Xbox<00:02:37.650> 360

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just like on the regular Xbox 360

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.390 
just like on the regular Xbox 360
controller<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.230> approximate<00:02:40.710> size<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
controller and the approximate size is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.440 
controller and the approximate size is
around<00:02:42.020> 109

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
around 109

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.250 
around 109
154<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:47.570> 60.5<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:49.020> high<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.860> that's<00:02:50.220> cool

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
154 and 60.5 on high so that's cool

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.350 
154 and 60.5 on high so that's cool
it<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.620> work<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> Xbox<00:02:53.310> 360<00:02:53.460> system<00:02:54.030> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it can work on the Xbox 360 system of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.330 
it can work on the Xbox 360 system of
course<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> PC<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> about<00:02:57.060> its<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:59.160> just

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
course for the PC and about its you just

toggle<00:05:04.019> stick<00:05:04.459> to<00:05:05.459> back<00:05:05.639> so<00:05:05.939> you<00:05:06.029> could<00:05:06.179> still

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
toggle stick to back so you could still

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.959

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.529 
loop but on here it has them on the
bottom<00:05:09.419> so<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.649> might<00:05:11.099> also<00:05:11.279> get<00:05:11.549> you<00:05:12.209> might

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.529 
bottom so that might also get you might
need<00:05:12.779> some<00:05:13.009> getting<00:05:14.009> used<00:05:14.249> to<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.509> a

need some getting used to this is a
tournament<00:05:15.959> Edition<00:05:16.499> my<00:05:16.860> way<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:17.249> it's<00:05:17.369> the

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:17.399

battlefield<00:05:17.879> 3<00:05:18.089> edition<00:05:19.159> the<00:05:20.159> design<00:05:20.639> of<00:05:20.939> it<00:05:21.089> I

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:21.119 
battlefield 3 edition the design of it I

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:24.939 
battlefield 3 edition the design of it I
really<00:05:21.839> really<00:05:22.409> like<00:05:23.099> I<00:05:23.339> think<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.849> looks

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
really really like I think it looks

really really like I think it looks
pretty<00:05:25.949> good<00:05:26.219> and<00:05:26.429> I<00:05:27.089> think<00:05:27.569> Razer<00:05:27.959> have

pretty good and I think Razer have
designed<00:05:28.649> this<00:05:28.799> quite<00:05:29.639> well<00:05:29.879> yes<00:05:30.149> of<00:05:30.749> course

designed this quite well yes of course
it<00:05:31.110> gets<00:05:31.199> some<00:05:31.379> getting<00:05:31.829> used<00:05:32.069> to<00:05:32.189> but<00:05:32.549> if<00:05:33.029> you

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:33.149 
it gets some getting used to but if you

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:35.629 
it gets some getting used to but if you
can<00:05:33.179> get<00:05:33.449> used<00:05:33.689> to<00:05:33.839> it<00:05:33.989> then<00:05:34.709> I<00:05:34.979> recommend<00:05:35.339> it
