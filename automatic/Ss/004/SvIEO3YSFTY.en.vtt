while longer without letting go and it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.180 
while longer without letting go and it
won't<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.120> so<00:01:47.900> that's<00:01:48.260> pretty<00:01:48.560> much<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:48.800> for

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
won't do it so that's pretty much it for

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.720 
won't do it so that's pretty much it for
cinch<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:50.810> we're<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.220> go<00:01:52.340> into<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
cinch and now we're going to go into the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.330 
cinch and now we're going to go into the
next<00:01:52.820> application<00:01:53.330> which<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.320> called<00:01:54.620> lock

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
next application which is called lock

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.320 
next application which is called lock
screen<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:58.210> lock<00:01:59.210> screen<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:01.330> another

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
screen to lock screen to is a another

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.160 
screen to lock screen to is a another
you<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.600> tweak<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:04.010> one<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.460> only<00:02:04.610> 199<00:02:05.570> right
