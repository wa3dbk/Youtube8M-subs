those tails after I split them I'm gonna
wrap<00:01:11.550> everything<00:01:12.550> back<00:01:12.850> up<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.150> hook<00:01:13.300> shank

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
of chartreuse mixed in with one strand

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.380 
of chartreuse mixed in with one strand
of<00:01:44.000> black<00:01:45.280> I'm<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.520> also<00:01:46.640> tie<00:01:46.940> those<00:01:47.150> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.510 
of black I'm going to also tie those in
on<00:01:47.960> top<00:01:48.230> of<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.500> hook<00:01:51.070> I'm<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.370> wrap

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
on top of the hook I'm going to wrap

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.300 
on top of the hook I'm going to wrap
backwards<00:01:56.830> then<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:57.920> stop<00:01:58.190> just<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.520> hair<00:01:58.700> short

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
backwards then I stop just a hair short

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.760 
backwards then I stop just a hair short
of<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.730> tails<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:03.080> give<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.350> first<00:02:03.500> wrap

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
of the tails to give that first wrap

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.340 
of the tails to give that first wrap
somewhere<00:02:04.280> two<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:05.000> go<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.780> now<00:02:05.960> as<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.200> wrap

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
somewhere two to go so now as you wrap

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:19.110 
somewhere two to go so now as you wrap
back<00:02:06.560> forward<00:02:06.950> do<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.220> nice<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:07.400> smooth

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 

I<00:02:19.209> know<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.049> trick<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.349> wrapping<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.040> super

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
I know the trick to wrapping the super

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.729 
I know the trick to wrapping the super
hair<00:02:21.549> is<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.760> make<00:02:21.909> one<00:02:22.090> loose<00:02:22.360> wrap<00:02:22.739> just

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
hair is you make one loose wrap just

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.059 
hair is you make one loose wrap just
like<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.220> then<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.090> use<00:02:25.269> your<00:02:25.299> fingernail

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
like that then you use your fingernail

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.110 
like that then you use your fingernail
to<00:02:27.069> actually<00:02:27.370> position<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:30.459> first<00:02:30.849> wrap

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
to actually position that first wrap

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.839 
to actually position that first wrap
where<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.540> want<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:33.129> then<00:02:33.280> once<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.790> do

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
where you want it and then once you do

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.280 
where you want it and then once you do
that<00:02:33.909> you<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.360> just<00:02:34.480> continue<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.930> wrap<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
that you can just continue to wrap it

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.020 
that you can just continue to wrap it
all<00:02:35.409> evenly<00:02:35.769> forward<00:02:38.670> once<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.760> get<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.000> going

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
all evenly forward once you get it going

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.190 
all evenly forward once you get it going
it<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.690> goes<00:02:40.840> real<00:02:41.019> smooth<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:43.629> tie<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.019> off

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
it just goes real smooth and tie it off

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.490 
it just goes real smooth and tie it off
at<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.530> head<00:02:51.390> once<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.629> you're

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
at the head once you do that you're

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.170 
at the head once you do that you're
gonna<00:02:53.560> actually<00:02:53.950> transition<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.640> some<00:02:54.970> brown

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
gonna actually transition to some brown

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.449 
gonna actually transition to some brown
thread<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> white<00:02:56.680> out<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.099> there<00:02:57.250> I

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
thread and get the white out of there I

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.550 
thread and get the white out of there I
do<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:58.540> by<00:02:58.840> having<00:02:59.079> another<00:02:59.200> bobbin

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
do that just by having another bobbin

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.240 
do that just by having another bobbin
handy<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.069> wrap<00:03:01.349> back<00:03:02.349> up<00:03:02.560> over<00:03:02.859> that<00:03:03.010> white

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
handy and wrap back up over that white

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.759 
handy and wrap back up over that white
thread<00:03:06.930> then<00:03:07.930> you're<00:03:08.200> going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.379> tie<00:03:08.560> in<00:03:08.739> a

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
thread then you're going to tie in a

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.569 
thread then you're going to tie in a
piece<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.340> CDCR<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.090> use<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.780> CDC<00:03:11.349> puffs<00:03:11.650> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
piece of CDCR I use the CDC puffs the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.500 
piece of CDCR I use the CDC puffs the
reason<00:03:12.819> I<00:03:12.909> do<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:14.879> tips<00:03:15.879> on<00:03:16.180> each<00:03:16.359> of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
reason I do that is the tips on each of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.149 
reason I do that is the tips on each of
the<00:03:16.569> puffs<00:03:17.790> are<00:03:18.790> even<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.739> makes<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:21.010> nice

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
the puffs are even so it makes a nice

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.030 
the puffs are even so it makes a nice
wing<00:03:21.840> there's<00:03:22.840> no<00:03:22.959> stray<00:03:23.260> fibers<00:03:23.470> or<00:03:23.889> anything

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
wing there's no stray fibers or anything

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.849 
wing there's no stray fibers or anything
on<00:03:24.310> them<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.989> I'm<00:03:26.049> gonna<00:03:26.169> see<00:03:26.380> there<00:03:26.560> how<00:03:26.799> the

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
on them so I'm gonna see there how the

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.599 
on them so I'm gonna see there how the
tips<00:03:27.220> are<00:03:27.459> all<00:03:27.609> nice<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.599> even<00:03:29.220> when<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.250> tie<00:03:30.489> in

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
tips are all nice and even when I tie in

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.780 
tips are all nice and even when I tie in
the<00:03:30.700> puffs<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.500> tie<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.769> fairly<00:03:33.250> long<00:03:33.489> to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
the puffs I tie it in fairly long to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.420 
the puffs I tie it in fairly long to
begin<00:03:33.910> with<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:36.340> two<00:03:36.849> wraps<00:03:37.680> over<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.799> then<00:03:39.400> I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
begin with I do two wraps over it then I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.449 
begin with I do two wraps over it then I
take<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.940> tag<00:03:40.629> ends<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.859> I<00:03:41.980> actually<00:03:42.099> just

pull pull on oopsie so I'll lay down a

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.270 
pull pull on oopsie so I'll lay down a
few<00:03:48.549> wraps<00:03:48.819> er<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.590> take<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.010> pull

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280
