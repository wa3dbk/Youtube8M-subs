00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.529
 let's prepare a letter sent last night 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.990
 for this we are going to need 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.109
 six or eight silvers 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.560
 400 grams of flour 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 messi is about yeast 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.479
 that spreads its marine branches 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 five games 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 430 grams of sugar 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.050
 let's start making the way 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.490
 we left 180 grams of sugar on the ground with a little water 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 we leave it 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.150
 until you start to put a little escuredo and start mixing 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.680
 stir well with a spoon 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 so that we do not burn 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.770
 when he has a brown color he cited we mix 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 non-stop 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.239
 until you have this group that immediately sees the chamas 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.599
 on the base the tailor the cake covering the entire base 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.099
 we have to do very fast if we do not get the carmen 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.809
 we can also use the candy already made although it would not be the same 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:29.779
 we stop to cut 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.459
 bananas 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.390
 between 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 and in several ways 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 to put them 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.409
 vigo 5 8 bananas because the understanding of the base that you are going to use I as 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.169
 stiglitz there was a very big 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.169
 I'm going to use more bananas 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.509
 from espartinas to each other we are placing ourselves 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.329
 all over the base 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.329
 there can not be any overturn 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.039
 and we reserve three bananas for the sponge cake 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.949
 well without a hole 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.909
 for masters add sugar 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:29.339
 I wish butter 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.339
 the 250 grams conjugate in your case 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.789
 and we mix well 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.459
 and well we emphasize the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.659
 and you know when we got the cake we brought him a little water bottle to 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.659
 I do not know I do not know what 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.889
 spider we gave the games a 1 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.389
 We were mixing well 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.479
 sections to shorten the three bananas in pieces stopped 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.880
 and that's where I wanna just like the ones who gave me here with my hand are not 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.270
 it crushes refers 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.270
 until you want a porridge and mash 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.949
 we already reserve others to medium or yeast charles 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.009
 to the flour 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.009
 we do not see well 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.559
 has there is more the 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.839
 Banana's mashed 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.839
 To the mix 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.180
 with dejected air and we simply mix it 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.180
 a little 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.460
 and there's more 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.630
 and added a little bit of vanilla essence powder but it's not 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.870
 essential just to give it a little more flavor 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.469
 to take it to the base 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:26.449
 and we take it to the oven 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:31.080
 at 180 degrees for approximately 35 45 minutes 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.580
 you're going to put a toothpick to see what the cake is made 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.110
 We were going to let it cool for a hundred for half an hour 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:50.869
 and when it is cold or we are going to pass a knife the base 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.110
 and we inform them with nothing with help a plate a tray going around 

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:58.249
 tow the fact 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:01.580
