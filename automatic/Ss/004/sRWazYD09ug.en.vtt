come<00:00:10.260> two<00:00:10.410> numbers<00:00:10.770> part<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.300> will

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.390 
come two numbers part two today we will

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.210 
come two numbers part two today we will
be<00:00:12.480> looking<00:00:12.630> at<00:00:12.930> highest<00:00:13.410> common<00:00:13.650> factor<00:00:13.680> and

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
be looking at highest common factor and

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.170 
be looking at highest common factor and
lowest<00:00:14.520> common<00:00:14.700> multiple<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> highest

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
lowest common multiple the highest

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.720 
lowest common multiple the highest
common<00:00:18.420> factor<00:00:18.450> of<00:00:18.930> two<00:00:19.560> numbers<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.190> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
common factor of two numbers is the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
common factor of two numbers is the
largest<00:00:21.060> number<00:00:21.210> which<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> factor<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.529> both

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
largest number which is a factor of both

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
largest number which is a factor of both
of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.190> numbers<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:24.060> example<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:25.050> highest

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of the numbers for example the highest

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.680 
of the numbers for example the highest
common<00:00:25.560> factor<00:00:25.620> of<00:00:26.040> 16<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.880> 24<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.780> 8

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.860 

this<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.489> largest<00:00:37.789> number<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.840> a

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
this is because the largest number is a

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.110 
this is because the largest number is a
factor<00:00:39.289> which<00:00:39.680> is<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.890> factor<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.340> both<00:00:40.699> numbers

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
factor which is a factor of both numbers

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.970 
factor which is a factor of both numbers
to<00:00:41.870> work<00:00:42.019> out<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.440> highest<00:00:42.710> common<00:00:42.949> factor

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
to work out the highest common factor

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.369 
to work out the highest common factor
you<00:00:43.460> must<00:00:43.670> put<00:00:43.850> both<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.570> numbers<00:00:44.600> in<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
you must put both of the numbers in the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.869 
you must put both of the numbers in the
product<00:00:45.769> of<00:00:45.949> its<00:00:46.070> prime<00:00:46.370> factors<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:49.250> 16

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
product of its prime factors so 16

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.000 
product of its prime factors so 16
branches<00:00:50.809> off<00:00:50.960> into<00:00:51.250> two<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.549> eight<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.890> so

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
branches off into two and eight just so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.039 
branches off into two and eight just so
we<00:00:55.190> don't<00:00:55.219> get<00:00:55.519> confused<00:00:55.820> we<00:00:56.390> will<00:00:56.540> circle<00:00:57.019> the

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
we don't get confused we will circle the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:04.530 
we don't get confused we will circle the
prime<00:00:57.440> number<00:00:58.540> 28<00:00:59.540> come<00:00:59.870> two<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.320> four

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.960 

and<00:01:04.720> four<00:01:05.470> can<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:05.890> branched<00:01:06.280> off<00:01:06.400> into<00:01:06.580> two

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
and four can be branched off into two

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.340 
and four can be branched off into two
and<00:01:07.240> two

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.820 

love<00:01:14.950> 16<00:01:15.549> is<00:01:15.790> two<00:01:16.330> times<00:01:16.780> two<00:01:17.049> times<00:01:17.080> two<00:01:17.680> times

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
love 16 is two times two times two times

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:32.180 
love 16 is two times two times two times
two

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:43.730 

24<00:01:33.190> we've<00:01:34.060> branched<00:01:34.270> off<00:01:34.570> into<00:01:34.600> two<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.470> 12

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.530 

12<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.790> branched<00:01:45.060> off<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.210> two<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> six

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.290 

and<00:01:49.140> 6<00:01:49.470> into<00:01:49.890> 2<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:50.430> 3

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:08.590 

so<00:01:54.840> 24<00:01:55.410> equals<00:01:55.620> 2<00:01:56.310> times<00:01:56.550> 2<00:01:57.030> times<00:01:57.480> 2<00:01:57.660> times<00:01:58.080> 3

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.680 

if<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.440> see<00:02:09.680> which<00:02:10.130> prime<00:02:10.910> numbers<00:02:11.330> they<00:02:11.660> both

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
if you see which prime numbers they both

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.830 
if you see which prime numbers they both
share<00:02:12.460> we<00:02:13.460> will<00:02:13.670> find<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.270> your<00:02:14.390> boss<00:02:14.600> said

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
share we will find that your boss said

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:29.500 
share we will find that your boss said
32

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.710 

look<00:02:30.260> at<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.470> numbers<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.129> share<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
look at the numbers that they share and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.900 
look at the numbers that they share and
choose<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.900> one<00:02:33.080> with<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> lowest<00:02:33.920> power

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.130 

on<00:02:40.420> 2<00:02:40.780> cubed<00:02:41.140> equals<00:02:41.710> 8

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.309 

lowest<00:02:47.980> common<00:02:48.220> multiple<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.840> lowest<00:02:50.140> common

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
lowest common multiple the lowest common

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.490 
lowest common multiple the lowest common
multiple<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:51.250> two<00:02:51.910> numbers<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.110> smallest

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
multiple of two numbers is the smallest

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.820 
multiple of two numbers is the smallest
number<00:02:54.120> which<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> multiple<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.319> both

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
number which is a multiple of both

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:11.440 
number which is a multiple of both
numbers<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:59.160> 18<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.400> 40<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.990> 360

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.839 

again<00:03:12.200> we<00:03:12.530> will<00:03:12.680> put<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> numbers<00:03:13.340> into<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
again we will put the numbers into the

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.839 
again we will put the numbers into the
product<00:03:14.090> their<00:03:14.540> prime<00:03:14.750> factors<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:16.129> 18<00:03:16.550> will

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
product their prime factors so 18 will

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.809 
product their prime factors so 18 will
be<00:03:16.879> rushed<00:03:17.269> off<00:03:17.510> into<00:03:18.080> two<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.530> nine

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.660 

nine<00:03:23.599> will<00:03:24.109> be<00:03:24.260> brushed<00:03:24.499> off<00:03:24.680> into<00:03:25.129> three<00:03:25.430> and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
nine will be brushed off into three and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.590 
nine will be brushed off into three and
three

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:42.590 

so<00:03:31.200> 18<00:03:32.270> equals<00:03:33.270> 2<00:03:33.870> times<00:03:33.900> 3<00:03:34.470> times<00:03:34.680> 3

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.350 

which<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.530> also<00:03:43.740> be<00:03:43.890> written<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.460> two<00:03:44.940> times

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
which can also be written as two times

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.110 
which can also be written as two times
three<00:03:45.870> squared

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.850 

now<00:03:51.659> 40<00:03:52.200> will<00:03:53.099> be<00:03:53.340> branched<00:03:54.030> off<00:03:54.239> into<00:03:54.560> 4<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
now 40 will be branched off into 4 and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.030 
now 40 will be branched off into 4 and
10

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.759 

for<00:04:00.700> will<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.180> branched<00:04:01.540> off<00:04:01.689> into<00:04:01.930> two<00:04:02.530> and

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
for will be branched off into two and

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.620 
for will be branched off into two and
two

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.940 

and<00:04:06.720> ten<00:04:07.590> into<00:04:08.310> two<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.700> five

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.080 

so<00:04:14.550> 40<00:04:15.180> can<00:04:15.870> be<00:04:15.989> written<00:04:16.169> as<00:04:16.440> 2<00:04:16.829> times<00:04:17.310> 2<00:04:17.639> times

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
so 40 can be written as 2 times 2 times

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:27.570 
so 40 can be written as 2 times 2 times
2<00:04:18.239> times<00:04:18.630> 5

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.540 

which<00:04:28.180> can<00:04:28.360> also<00:04:28.569> be<00:04:28.720> written<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:29.680> 2<00:04:30.099> cubed

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
which can also be written as 2 cubed

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.620 
which can also be written as 2 cubed
times<00:04:31.060> 5

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.590 

now<00:04:36.230> for<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.500> lowest<00:04:36.650> common<00:04:37.130> multiple<00:04:37.600> we

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
now for the lowest common multiple we

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.140 
now for the lowest common multiple we
look<00:04:38.840> up<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.590> numbers<00:04:40.370> they<00:04:40.550> share<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.030> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
look up the numbers they share and the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.260 
look up the numbers they share and the
ones<00:04:41.330> they<00:04:41.480> know<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:42.590> numbers<00:04:42.950> they<00:04:43.130> share<00:04:43.430> we

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
ones they know the numbers they share we

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:55.350 
ones they know the numbers they share we
look<00:04:44.480> at<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.780> one<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.650> highest<00:04:45.980> power

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.309 

so<00:04:56.020> in<00:04:56.199> this<00:04:56.349> case<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:57.280> would<00:04:57.400> be<00:04:57.580> written<00:04:57.909> as<00:04:58.319> 2

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
so in this case it would be written as 2

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:08.410 
so in this case it would be written as 2
cubed<00:04:59.770> times<00:05:00.340> three<00:05:00.849> squared<00:05:01.020> times<00:05:02.020> five

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.460 

which<00:05:09.020> can<00:05:09.260> be<00:05:09.380> written<00:05:09.500> as<00:05:09.770> eight<00:05:10.120> times<00:05:11.120> nine

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
which can be written as eight times nine

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.640 
which can be written as eight times nine
times<00:05:12.470> five

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:29.090 

can<00:05:18.280> be<00:05:18.400> written<00:05:18.520> as<00:05:18.759> 72<00:05:19.270> times<00:05:19.750> 5

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:38.879 

equal<00:05:29.790> to<00:05:29.840> 360

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.949
