00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:22.460
 Hello from the blog to show you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.460
 samsung 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:39.860
 fs 8 thousand to show some details 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.649
 for you and among other basic things 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.390
 It is also interesting that I 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.219
 I'll show you if you do not give in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.840
 video shows in other videos for you 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.840
 do not stay too long anymore 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:05.509
 I decided to record this video because it 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.340
 I found virtually nothing about this 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.869
 sound had practically no 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.970
 comments mainly dominguinhos 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.130
 pourris few comments they had 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.490
 were positive comments 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.490
 finally the Flemish 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.630
 here i am using the bluetooth function 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.840
 for some who had doubt that I saw 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:38.650
 some videos from some colleagues in the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:44.300
 youtube is that if you took it or not 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.640
 the bluetooth of your notebook or 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 computer or computer 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.369
 I do not know if I do not already know but I believe 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:03.080
 be the same as you can see 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:09.790
 music is playing on the notebook through 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.790
 of the bluetooth function here for you 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 maybe in another video if someone is 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.340
 It interests the post with setting the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.390
 bluetooth function 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.390
 but see here 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 getting the judge is here รณ samsung hifi 07 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:03:01.760
 the 23 f is exactly the beginning 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:03:04.280
 pithan twice will open a box of 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:11.000
 Year configuration problem so much that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:18.970
 it's already open here exactly here 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.970
 3rd house is my samsung notebook 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 connected 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:35.670
 if the connect object will stop there in the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 connect the ke ha to connect in there 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:46.730
 seems to disconnect passed the message 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:52.530
 back to the ride 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:58.400
 to connect a new device and oil 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.020
 go back to playing on a google notebook 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.820
 it works 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.970
 the first is a panel procedure 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.970
 of control 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.530
 connecting connect it plays to the sound 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:22.590
 well this part is that puts it to you 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.880
 that he not only with her did not vote through 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.160
 of the cell phone 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.580
 it connects through the computer 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.500
 I also thought 'ok automatically ' them 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.660
 connector came back high out came back to 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 launch the notebook and continued that it was 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.800
 in the tam 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:46.639
 when this happens because the links 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.639
 f &amp; c disconnects in control panel 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.650
 manage the audio device 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.270
 Of course this notebook tried bluetooth 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.860
 if you do not have to have a 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.849
 bluetooth adapter and come here speaking 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:17.449
 disconnected and reconnected is 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.449
 connected and connected pipe 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.970
 and that I'm here I was old 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:30.380
 was red was 10 teams 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.380
 which set default sam 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.300
 The people may have started. 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:06.130
 your name if it does not work on the first 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:06.130
 but I spend this even a manager 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:29.500
 anyway the sound came out in our 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:33.330
 booth did not celebrate without receiving and this 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.650
 is standard communication one hour 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.650
 just go there 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:51.040
 Technically this does not catch on top 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.620
 You come to the control bath that 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.080
 he connects what we are staying here 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.380
 I'll record other videos for 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.560
 detail some installation 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:10.450
 the front panel and rear panel as 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:19.780
 this central box a useful kiss 18 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:26.610
 versal of the spyder in here spoke to 12 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:31.750
 inches in here is for medium to severe 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:43.810
 or serious climb to 22 with two drive 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:46.450
 We called it the horn FAO says 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.750
 and shows you the installation as 

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.570
 got behind the equipment and how to 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:55.680
 impedance so as not to damage the 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.680
 It's over until the next video
