line<00:00:20.970> watch<00:00:21.180> where<00:00:21.420> your<00:00:21.570> lines<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.960> crossing

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
line watch where your lines are crossing

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
line watch where your lines are crossing
everywhere<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.580> keep<00:00:23.760> track<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
everywhere just so you keep track of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
everywhere just so you keep track of
everything<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> trip<00:00:26.010> line<00:00:26.250> goes<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
everything so trip line goes in the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.589 
everything so trip line goes in the
water<00:00:26.880> first

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
water first

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.509 
water first
once<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:28.529> boat<00:00:28.740> moving<00:00:29.010> away<00:00:29.250> from

once you see your boat moving away from
the<00:00:29.640> float<00:00:29.910> right<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.439> point<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the float right at that point then you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
the float right at that point then you
can<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.340> ahead<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.550> pick<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> parachute

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
can go ahead and pick up the parachute

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.790 
can go ahead and pick up the parachute
the<00:00:33.420> hardware<00:00:33.809> key<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.290> control<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the hardware key and control the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040 
the hardware key and control the
hardware<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.309> picking<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> ring<00:00:35.969> drop<00:00:36.809> all

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
hardware by picking up the ring drop all

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290 
hardware by picking up the ring drop all
that<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> water<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.460> keep<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.820> ring

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that into the water but keep the ring

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
that into the water but keep the ring
no<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.719> look<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> ring<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
no you look go of the ring and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.990 
no you look go of the ring and
everything<00:00:40.950> once<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.399> grab<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> hole<00:00:41.820> when

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
everything once you grab a hole when

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
everything once you grab a hole when
you're<00:00:42.120> picking<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.739> you<00:00:43.739> hold<00:00:43.950> onto<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> ring

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you're picking up you hold onto the ring

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.979 
you're picking up you hold onto the ring
so<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> doesn't<00:00:45.149> fall<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.329> enhance<00:00:45.750> you've

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so it doesn't fall out enhance you've

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
so it doesn't fall out enhance you've
got<00:00:46.110> lines<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.590> all<00:00:46.770> over<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.039> place<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
got lines going all over the place so

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
got lines going all over the place so
you<00:00:48.300> throw<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> shot<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you throw all that over one shot then I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
you throw all that over one shot then I
usually<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> guide<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> line<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.059> my

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
usually like to guide the line out my

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
usually like to guide the line out my
hands<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.469> personal<00:00:52.710> throw<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.520> all

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
hands but that's personal throw this all

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
hands but that's personal throw this all
in<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> water<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.539> once<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
in the water at once or you can do it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
in the water at once or you can do it
you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.280> pay<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> little<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> time

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.540 

your<00:01:05.019> signal<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.650> when<00:01:05.800> it's<00:01:05.950> time<00:01:06.010> to<00:01:06.280> go<00:01:06.400> in

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
your signal you when it's time to go in

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.160 
your signal you when it's time to go in
reverse<00:01:06.670> you'll<00:01:07.090> signal<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.660> go<00:01:07.870> in

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
reverse you'll signal you to go in

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.920 
reverse you'll signal you to go in
reverse<00:01:08.470> before<00:01:09.250> deploying<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.820> trip<00:01:10.030> line

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.510 

so<00:01:13.930> normally<00:01:14.229> we<00:01:14.350> point<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.770> direction<00:01:15.340> we

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
so normally we point the direction we

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.500 
so normally we point the direction we
want<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.910> go<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:16.270> we're<00:01:16.390> going

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
pointing backwards let me go

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:31.350 
pointing backwards let me go
Dorris<00:01:19.600> turn<00:01:29.580> okay<00:01:30.580> honey<00:01:30.790> try<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.180> head
