 things are always going to be chopped up 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:25.800
 the finger that cut bill was not that the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.189

 this is a very easy beauty recipe 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 this revenue basically consists of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 lie loves and onion 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 so here are the steps here 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 are not right because I 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.979
 I'm making food for six people. 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.950
 then this conditioned onion is more or 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.439
 less about four five onions for two 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.979

 here we are using double then and 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.290
 just want a bucket with eight onions 8 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.479
 chewing gum lentils and four losses 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 Let 's go the first step is that if you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.540
 They want to know how you do to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.079
 cut onion this way here it's just open 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.079
 the video here 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.080
 how can you continue to watch in 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:43.890
 thin this door in a small clump of water 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.890
 just lie 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.600
 Woe to those who seek to deceive us. 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.660
 cook until she gets more or less 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.660
 soft medium and mail still hard because it is 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.600
 when she's really in the middle of it 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:14.680
 middle of the line is still the point of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.680
 You stop for fucking olive oil. 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.220
 add the onion in the frying pan 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.239

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.930
 Last all this time you're leaving 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.370
 and oil and olive oil or partially 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.630

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.180
 it is completely golden almost 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.950

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.840
 it's onion has to really be 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 so caramelized to an extreme level 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.170
 when it reached this point of 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:58.549
 golden she is good to enter 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.400
 half of it in the old one the lentil 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.320
 people hung up here because she 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.370
 arrived before the sector 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.019

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.670

 your pan is the smell carefully 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:36.950
 not to overthrow it goes too far 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.400
 Hey you see with the toast it was a 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.400
 careful person 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.660
 add the seasonings we will use here 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.720

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.310
 if you have not pepper the CIA and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.510
 some reason you have pepper 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.570
 Jamaica 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.560
 use jamaica pepper plus cinnamon 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:02.030
 but the important thing here is a lot of pepper 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.510
 to Syria because that is the heart of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.400
 recipe and hop 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.520
 the water has to get up rice 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.170

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:21.590
