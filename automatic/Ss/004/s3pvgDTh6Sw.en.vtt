00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
hard tail this is the hardest our bridge

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.689 
hard tail this is the hardest our bridge
adjustable<00:00:59.109> saddles<00:00:59.469> you've<00:01:00.249> got<00:01:00.339> some<00:01:00.460> stock

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
adjustable saddles you've got some stock

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.880 
adjustable saddles you've got some stock
pickups<00:01:01.089> in<00:01:01.269> here<00:01:01.449> which<00:01:01.659> active<00:01:02.469> pick<00:01:02.739> up

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
pickups in here which active pick up

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.619 
pickups in here which active pick up
size<00:01:03.159> which<00:01:03.519> certain<00:01:04.089> companies<00:01:04.449> don't<00:01:04.600> make

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
size which certain companies don't make

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.130 
size which certain companies don't make
active<00:01:05.050> pickups<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.070> could<00:01:07.140> change

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
active pickups so you could change

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.039 
active pickups so you could change
anything<00:01:09.070> else<00:01:09.310> yeah<00:01:09.729> absolutely<00:01:10.060> ideal<00:01:10.630> for

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
anything else yeah absolutely ideal for

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:11.219 
anything else yeah absolutely ideal for
that

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
that

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.039 
that
and<00:01:12.189> obviously<00:01:12.310> it's<00:01:12.729> an<00:01:12.820> eight-string<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.540> we

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
and obviously it's an eight-string so we

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.120 
and obviously it's an eight-string so we
have<00:01:14.229> eight<00:01:14.649> strings<00:01:14.979> and<00:01:16.259> basically<00:01:17.259> you

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
have eight strings and basically you

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.730 
have eight strings and basically you
have<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> longer<00:01:19.079> scale<00:01:20.079> length<00:01:20.350> which<00:01:20.710> means

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
have a longer scale length which means

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.800 
have a longer scale length which means
basically<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> distance<00:01:22.000> between<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.570> nuts

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
basically the distance between the nuts

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.200 
basically the distance between the nuts
and<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.170> bridge<00:01:23.409> is<00:01:23.649> longer<00:01:24.430> than<00:01:24.610> your<00:01:24.850> six

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
and the bridge is longer than your six

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.870 
and the bridge is longer than your six
string<00:01:25.479> okay<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.680> actually<00:01:26.740> 27<00:01:27.520> inches

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
string okay this is actually 27 inches

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.050 
string okay this is actually 27 inches
between<00:01:28.600> no<00:01:29.020> now<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:29.979> compared<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.880> most

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
between no now so compared to most

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.499 
between no now so compared to most
standard<00:01:31.539> six<00:01:31.780> strings<00:01:32.020> about<00:01:32.289> 25<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.950> half

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
standard six strings about 25 and a half

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.209 
standard six strings about 25 and a half
so<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.539> guess<00:01:34.719> that's<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.469> hold<00:01:36.039> the

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
so I guess that's just the hold the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.859 
so I guess that's just the hold the
lower<00:01:36.399> tuning<00:01:36.850> isn't<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.659> stability

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
lower tuning isn't it so the stability

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.959 
lower tuning isn't it so the stability
of<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.380> tuning<00:01:38.770> stays<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.310> same<00:01:39.340> instead<00:01:39.909> of

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
of the tuning stays the same instead of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.840 
of the tuning stays the same instead of
it<00:01:40.119> go<00:01:41.969> absolutely<00:01:44.159> leaves<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.640> sort<00:01:45.820> of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
it go absolutely leaves you to sort of

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.520 
it go absolutely leaves you to sort of
experiment<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.630> string<00:01:46.899> gauges<00:01:47.289> that<00:01:47.409> you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
experiment of the string gauges that you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.749 
experiment of the string gauges that you
want<00:01:47.710> cuz<00:01:47.859> I<00:01:47.920> think<00:01:48.009> of<00:01:48.130> eight<00:01:48.250> strings<00:01:48.579> as

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
want cuz I think of eight strings as

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.920 
want cuz I think of eight strings as
well<00:01:48.789> people<00:01:49.119> are<00:01:49.270> experimenting<00:01:49.570> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
well people are experimenting a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.929 
well people are experimenting a
different<00:01:50.170> tunings<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.070> different<00:01:51.490> purposes

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
different tunings and different purposes

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.349 
different tunings and different purposes
as<00:01:52.119> well<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:53.130> lower<00:01:54.130> than<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.759> f-sharp

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
as well so lower than the f-sharp

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.120 
as well so lower than the f-sharp
some<00:01:55.630> people<00:01:55.810> are<00:01:55.869> choosing<00:01:56.020> down<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.710> e<00:01:56.740> I've

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
some people are choosing down to e I've

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.240 
some people are choosing down to e I've
got<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.399> in<00:01:57.579> E<00:01:57.759> at<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.939> moment<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:59.380> think<00:01:59.979> at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
got this in E at the moment I think at

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.370 
got this in E at the moment I think at
the<00:02:00.310> moment<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.729> comes<00:02:00.880> factory<00:02:01.689> setup<00:02:01.929> with

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
the moment it comes factory setup with

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.249 
the moment it comes factory setup with
probably<00:02:02.829> like<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.009> 62<00:02:03.729> okay<00:02:04.299> which<00:02:04.600> my

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
probably like a 62 okay which my

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.899 
probably like a 62 okay which my
personal<00:02:05.710> opinion<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.100> bit<00:02:06.460> like<00:02:06.609> but<00:02:06.820> you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
personal opinion is a bit like but you

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.760 
personal opinion is a bit like but you
could<00:02:07.060> always<00:02:07.210> get<00:02:07.509> strings<00:02:07.869> really<00:02:08.350> easy<00:02:08.560> now
