00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.040
 the jury understood the flaws but without 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.139
 But obviously he gave 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.480
 relevant comments she felt 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.339
 disappointed in her performance believes that 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.820
 he did continuity but he missed a lot 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.170
 more than giving today may be that yes take out 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 the nail we will see what were the 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.420
 reactions of alejandra alfaro forward 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.520
 presumably I did not deserve to pass 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.160
 obviously you have to judge the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.940
 presentation of the day but believe me 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.250
 tomorrow I leave with everything is 10 and 17 and 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.580
 here I have for a while until tomorrow I do not think 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 I will go to enjoy 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.320
 I like to be tomorrow 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.320
 but tomorrow I see it 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.899
 it's Alejandra's last chance 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.910
 well said sir is the last 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.770
 opportunity does not come saying the jury 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.900
 you constantly have to play the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.390
 everything for the whole you have to go out and kill 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.949
 I hope that makes Alejandra Alfaro us 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.030
 sing are white you 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.520
 dead island is the time to present to 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 Alejandra on the red fame scene 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.270

 I surrender 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.590

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.310
 one 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 descended 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.790
 well, once 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.180

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 rykwert about six of my goals 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.920
 Sun 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.690
 then a platform

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.630
 I am me 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.360
 and less 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519

 with your best Christian weapons sir 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.650
 what I just really is my place where 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.100
 is the jury has been the face of banias 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.820
 and Ã¶zil 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.830
 diego ulises stretched stretches it seems that 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.639
 the sensations are finally innate in 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.740
 exactly at last 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.169
 in fact, what I have been asking for 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.479
 started the program you have shown your best 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.759
 I was not wrong the other day 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.409
 when I said that it is indeed 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.240
 unforgivable that you have forgotten the 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.340
 letter but you have scenic dignity 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.620
 and that if you are an artist and that it can be 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.069
 better that I believe in you and that I wish you what 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.210
 I really really congratulate you 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.810
 Alexandra 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.699

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.500
 is the girl we saw in the casting 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.150
 Well here it is just tonight 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.189
 is the activity of some a casting of 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.479
 I congratulate everything you have done 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:34.479
 go empty 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.590
 for my absolute magic I have been 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.210
 enjoying fascinated I thank you for 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.560
 this interpretation of truth that you 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.690
 incredible past it seems to me is a 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.250
 wonderful interpreter thank you I tell you 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.969
 one thing this goes red you know why 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:56.830
 because the teachers the singing category 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.389
 the jury professors please good 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:03.430
 nights to the professors of the academy 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:06.490
 carla what is your comment on me 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.499
 I believe in you yes I think you have a 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.920
 beautiful voice have you had problems of 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:15.950
 weather 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.420
 I've had the falsettos 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:23.080
 serious has not been so accurate not if 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:27.490
 unfortunately I do not agree 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.490
 with what he swore he told them 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.230
 if I would like to rescue what I wanted 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.700
 tell them in the general teaching was 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.100
 very nervous singing with her eyes 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.580
 closed and did not move at any time 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.320
 and it did not transmit anything and I think with two 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.820
 indications have you raised all that 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.910
 interpretation I applaud 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.830
 that's the beauty of the rescue that the 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.340
 jury and teachers may not be 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.990
 of agreement and that is going to see the end to 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.610
 who rescues the jury and whom 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.980
 rescues the professors there is a replica 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.200
 from the jury that I think what 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.810
 they say the teachers is good is super 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.270
 valid if they question me at the time 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.630
 when the rhythm part mentioned this 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.300
 song accepts 5 to accept the 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.730
 I then phrased that rhythmic part to me 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.190
 it did not bother me in any case it made me 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.790
 that I like more suddenly I like 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.890
 when a phrase singer to quite 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.780
 are the opinions of the jury and 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.580
 teacher's opinions of teachers 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.050
 remember that today the rescue in each 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.120
 category to both the jury and the 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.400
 teachers will save some of the 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.010
 participants a lot of luck pesito por 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.010
