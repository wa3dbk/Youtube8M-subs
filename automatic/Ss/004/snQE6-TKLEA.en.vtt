 such a fresh air full I have something on 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840
 I don't think so 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.330
 now but some don't give pizza 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.760
 because some 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760

 this offers is busy in the garden 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.069
 these points 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.409
 that will no longer work 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 This brings the team working in a backyard 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.139
 and that he is his brother and this is also a name but now I am in that 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.469
 Give meaning 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.489

 it's about working in the garden 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.739
 and what do you think yourself 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.560
 it's a strange thing because after a massive departure from the Italian 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.560
 what falls anyway 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.039
 What's this 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.509
 she's right 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.219
 see the tights and that requires 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.239
 that doesn't have to be all about the gold 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.499
 beside him 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.659

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.359
 per 17 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.669
 or I have four femininity at my age 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.669
 and you're over eighty so you're 9 too 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.799
 the operating system 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.799
 these strict conditions 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.620
 he drives in the yellow leaves nothing in it he now stands in bare torso 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.680
 the piece is wrong to place I think the blows fell 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.769
 the police have become a mother 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.459

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.599
 the events 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.979
 The ordinary ones put the little ones on creation and start the road 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.470
 and while i have i have a 10 year old child 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.149
 you are not believing 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:00.149
 maybe i don't do anything 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.639
 earlier 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.639
 shares 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.569
 equally seriously i thought that remains monday to 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.870
 study i get i say opposite 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.569
 he stood still for a moment 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:46.949
 I am asking is the Vatican 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.250
 And then I don't have to make a man out of my bags 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.069
 to grab 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.680
 Sony doesn't really think seriously and Joel 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.779
 he doesn't call it that 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.779
 maybe 14 anp everyone needs cynic customer loyalty 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.360
 this is my life 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.740
 15 minutes not full 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.370
 and therefore you must keep your mouth shut about it 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.370
 whether it is what 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.090
 this is not an influence 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.090
 previous optimism on a woman who has been seriously ill since then 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.650
 that's how I have to do it patricia 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.259
 between nose and lips 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.719
 well against the plan 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.199
 but how does that work if you have promised too many questions 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.279
 he felt subtly 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.279
 he would eventually file you 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.349
 I do not believe in it 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.019
 And again is wrong just a week earlier but was best 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.659
 I have time just can afford the sweat signed another 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.669
 and tell you what you think okay okay 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.080
 I hold my heart 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 six o'clock 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.349
 the push 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:01.349
 laura 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.729
 if someone 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.800
 to be an idiot 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.029
 mess 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:10.689
 I signed 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.400
 here comes the set number 2 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
 the boost in the nights 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.939
 I don't know where to look 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.490
 well i know why not 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.229
 nothing should get 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.250
 that was the case with the Salvation Army 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.999
 reconstruction in particular 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.490
 that the team 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.770
 fifteen minutes before time 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.379
 here comes the sentiment 3 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.379
 put your number 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.490

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.169
 neat time 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.389
 you are in this time 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.210
 you are not the age 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.560
 I'm not sure if it's wise that you pick your clothes yourself 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.159
 I am very sure 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.779
 it is not wise that you pick your clothes yourself but pay for it 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:00.780
 did not have a driver's license 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.780
 Imagine a beautiful imagine you don't meet someone 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.469
 ordinary people with a large-scale 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.409
 but how 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.249
 I thought maybe that's but it wasn't 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.499
 ciman vries de brink offers 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:20.300

 that is 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.839
 you would be one 

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.839
 something all women in this position 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:46.309
 and find the nice woman 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.969
 critics thought for themselves 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:54.789
 you must understand well 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:57.789
