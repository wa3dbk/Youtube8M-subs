electrolytes<00:01:08.000> just<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.330> things

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
electrolytes just different things

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.760 
electrolytes just different things
frequencies<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.600> lucio<00:01:12.600> sites<00:01:13.020> throughout

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the year and reptiles just different

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.609 
the year and reptiles just different

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
things that a doctor might need and I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
things that a doctor might need and I
thought<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.220> cool<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.759> even

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
thought it was kind of cool they even

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.710 
thought it was kind of cool they even
had<00:01:21.240> stuff<00:01:21.540> about<00:01:21.750> blood<00:01:22.080> transfusions<00:01:23.720> like

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
had stuff about blood transfusions like

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.440 
had stuff about blood transfusions like
saying<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.380> most<00:01:26.070> blood<00:01:26.580> transfusions<00:01:27.210> will

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
saying how most blood transfusions will

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990 
saying how most blood transfusions will
probably<00:01:27.780> kill<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> donor<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> stuff<00:01:29.820> like

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
probably kill the donor and stuff like

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.530 
probably kill the donor and stuff like
that<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:31.890> interesting<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.970> was

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that so it was interesting it was

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.100 
that so it was interesting it was
definitely<00:01:35.570> educational<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> thought

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
definitely educational and I thought

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.039 
definitely educational and I thought
this<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.650> good<00:01:38.210> little<00:01:39.210> books<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.869> get

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this would be a good little books to get

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
this would be a good little books to get
and<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> goes<00:01:41.189> over<00:01:41.369> different<00:01:41.850> species<00:01:44.780> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and it goes over different species in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.219 
and it goes over different species in
serpents<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.740> stuff<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.369> long<00:01:48.060> as

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
serpents and stuff like that so long as

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.560 
serpents and stuff like that so long as
it's<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.470> different<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.420> definitely<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it's just different it's a definitely a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.440 
it's just different it's a definitely a
different<00:01:52.200> book<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> thought<00:01:54.270> it'd<00:01:54.420> be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
different book but I thought it'd be

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.200 
different book but I thought it'd be
cool<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.259> becoming<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
cool to have becoming of that and this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.859 
cool to have becoming of that and this

blizzards doll pattern losses on which
they<00:05:34.270> have<00:05:34.509> made<00:05:34.840> I<00:05:35.250> have<00:05:36.250> found<00:05:36.580> one<00:05:36.969> actually

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
they have made I have found one actually

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.350 
they have made I have found one actually
that<00:05:37.930> has<00:05:37.960> been<00:05:38.319> created<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:39.400> angel<00:05:39.879> reptiles

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
that has been created of angel reptiles

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.670 
that has been created of angel reptiles
has<00:05:40.690> created<00:05:40.930> a<00:05:41.520> bell<00:05:43.259> Murphy's<00:05:44.259> patternless

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
has created a bell Murphy's patternless

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.300 
has created a bell Murphy's patternless
so<00:05:45.550> they<00:05:45.759> are<00:05:45.969> able<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.569> be<00:05:46.779> created<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:47.560> you

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
so they are able to be created so you

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.959 
so they are able to be created so you
can<00:05:48.879> create<00:05:49.120> them<00:05:49.389> guys<00:05:49.629> it<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.680> a<00:05:50.710> farce<00:05:51.520> you

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
can create them guys it is a farce you

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.480 
can create them guys it is a farce you
can<00:05:52.210> do<00:05:52.419> it<00:05:52.599> though<00:05:52.839> it<00:05:53.080> is<00:05:53.650> hard<00:05:53.949> I'm<00:05:54.250> not

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
can do it though it is hard I'm not

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.920 
can do it though it is hard I'm not
saying<00:05:54.669> it's<00:05:54.879> easy<00:05:55.000> it's<00:05:55.449> like<00:05:55.659> the<00:05:55.779> bell

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
saying it's easy it's like the bell

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.890 
saying it's easy it's like the bell
blizzards<00:05:56.349> they<00:05:56.500> were<00:05:56.560> really<00:05:56.860> hard<00:05:57.099> to<00:05:57.219> make

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
blizzards they were really hard to make

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.899 
blizzards they were really hard to make
but<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.379> possible<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.279> that's<00:06:00.520> going<00:06:00.759> to<00:06:00.819> be

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
but it is possible so that's going to be

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.850 
but it is possible so that's going to be
awesome<00:06:01.229> incorporating<00:06:02.229> it<00:06:02.349> into<00:06:02.440> some

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
awesome incorporating it into some

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.980 
awesome incorporating it into some
really<00:06:03.219> cool<00:06:03.580> key<00:06:03.940> projects<00:06:04.629> and<00:06:04.779> I<00:06:04.810> have

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
really cool key projects and I have

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.490 
really cool key projects and I have
coming<00:06:05.229> up<00:06:05.500> which<00:06:06.159> I<00:06:06.279> can't<00:06:06.610> wait<00:06:06.909> for
