00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
I didn't want to go through that process

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.030 
I didn't want to go through that process
of<00:01:46.409> money<00:01:48.079> having<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> few<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.950> after<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.950 

um<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:55.150> yeah<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.780> got<00:01:56.410> some<00:01:56.710> again<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.330> second

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
um so yeah I got some again and second

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.840 
um so yeah I got some again and second
time<00:01:59.080> around<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.590> me<00:01:59.740> it<00:02:00.010> was<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.490> much<00:02:00.670> easier

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
time around to me it was so much easier

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.670 
time around to me it was so much easier
I<00:02:01.270> think<00:02:01.540> it's<00:02:01.690> because<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:01.990> already<00:02:02.230> knew<00:02:02.560> what

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
I think it's because I already knew what

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.310 
I think it's because I already knew what
I<00:02:02.740> was<00:02:02.890> doing<00:02:03.310> but<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.210> was<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:04.750> much<00:02:04.900> easier<00:02:05.050> to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
I was doing but it was so much easier to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.100 
I was doing but it was so much easier to
check<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.560> come<00:02:05.740> around<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.580> first<00:02:06.880> time

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
check to come around in the first time

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.020 
check to come around in the first time
um<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:09.690> did<00:02:10.690> swell<00:02:10.930> up<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.170> lot<00:02:11.470> my<00:02:11.920> kisses<00:02:12.460> and
