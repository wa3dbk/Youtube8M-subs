00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.890
 4 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.750
 oftentimes 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.650
 people observe near the resort and from this with the west 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.679
 during the morning and saw owen is to grow 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.630
 a very bright star 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.829
 for this star they call it a star of dawn but will that 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.410
 really is a star 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 keep an eye on is starting another observatory 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.240
 in fact it is not a star but all the planet Venus 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.820
 the ancient Greeks believed that they had conquered two planets 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.949
 to the dawn 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.449
 they called it sales the goddess of beauty and by nightfall called it 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 eve the evening star 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.170
 but then with the passage of time they realized that it was a doll 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.920
 planet 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.690
 and remained the name of what we owe the goddess of beauty but must 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.020
 to rule planet does not have to have anything 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 here's how your 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.250
 venetian surface surfaces 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 here it is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.409
 since it does not have a beautiful atmosphere like the earth because it is because 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.490
 this atmosphere formed of approximately 98% of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.869
 carbon and about 2% of other cases since it is not possible to live 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:29.890
 winters 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.760
 Besides that 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.670
 the temperature in paris 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 too hot 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.750
 Venus is a warmer planet from solar systems with the temperature at 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 get what is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.890
 to 462 degree celsius 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.640
 its translation movement 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.450
 its revolves around the sun and about 225 days pr 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.460
 has a rotation movement is something very special 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.649
 see here we indicate with negative sign 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.240
 this means that to have a retrograde movement 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 or in contrast to the movement of the earth 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.620
 then the voting moves within its own axis is well minus 243 days 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.820
 terrestrial 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.970
 in addition his equatorial father 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.210
 approximately six thousand and fifty kilometers, that is the average 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.040
 sun is indecent 8 million 208 thousand nine hundred and thirty kilometers 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:25.409
 more or less on the 30th day since 81 a space probe for wine was sent to 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:31.029
 probe revere 13 and it came to land on the surface - rihanna on March 1 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.750
 1982 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.769
 but for now there was not much time left 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.650
 why this probe worsens 3 ended up giving in and having the intense heat of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.249
 wines not only is the ca'doro something predominant on this planet but there 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.260
 it also rains 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.249
 but it's a rain 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.229
 aids 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 therefore it is not possible to live on the Venus planet 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.259
 - then with its greenhouse effect in the world 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:59.069
 very intense the solar rays to penetrate through the thick clouds of the 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.900
 Venus planet and over there 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.820
 can not get out 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.799
 and so is the heat 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.439
 I run to get an idea imagine that we have a car but if you 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.629
 is inside a car in a desert 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.180
 here in brazil so we can understand a little better 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.070
 But you're in a car on a day, yes, no, noon, at the beach. 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.530
 It's too hot there, and all the windows in the car 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.639
 I do not care about air conditioning 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.619
 and you will be fine 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:28.579
 It's good to heat up a lot because the sun's rays will not 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.180
 car 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.340
 and will never get the title in. 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.860
 is more or less what happens there on the planet Venus because of the fans 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.530
 thick clouds 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.599
 is the greenhouse effect 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.610
 so here 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.140
 observatory 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.140
 we leave the message of preservation of planet earth 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.349
 because if we do not take care of the planet earth it could be a Venus planet 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.509
 an intense greenhouse and rather rain artist 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.770
 if you have any questions any suggestions 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.670
 send an email to us a mega-action name with aval of climatempo porto com 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.510
 br br 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.680
 it was expected 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680
 in the next he observed thorÃ³ until there 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.919
