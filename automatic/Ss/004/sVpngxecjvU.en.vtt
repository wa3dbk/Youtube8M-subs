that that's the key reason number three

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.680 
that that's the key reason number three
is<00:04:39.330> kind<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.139> link<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.650> number<00:04:41.190> two<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.389> is

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
is kind of link to number two and it is

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.680 
is kind of link to number two and it is
to<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.200> with<00:04:43.440> being<00:04:43.680> too<00:04:44.130> stressed<00:04:44.729> when<00:04:45.510> you

too stressed you release cortisol and

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.620 
too stressed you release cortisol and
that<00:04:49.680> begins<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.370> negatively<00:04:50.820> affect<00:04:51.030> your
