00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.880
 fruit of that sectional legs 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.129

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.880
 before this panel 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.270
 thought the city the sides 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.550
 the legs 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.290
 it is not lowered 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.819
 this part of the arms 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.420
 according to these panels well 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.760
 and it opens to form the arms 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.050
 Nestor is who 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.390
 besides the work of who 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 he has broken his head 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.010
 it is put here in its place 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.310
 presentation under ita and lotina 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.350
 he foresaw that all this he writes his roh way 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.350
 a very simple case inspired by the one 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 and as I say and I can find for a hundred the bombachas hurt what 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.560
 I found 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.680
 next to megatron ap to explain timba mbuti 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.850
 all this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.980
 inspired by the g1 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.130
 turned around and got the pro postpone it's over 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.780
 to see if I find it per year 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.220
 but no group of experts 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.100
 well now following the main figure in this case 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.060
 at 30 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.400
 by the way this city I had it before 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.070
 I had bought used on ebay 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.950
 and this xv in english on my channel you russek st 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.109
 but I did it in Spanish 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.389
 and now that he will get it together with 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:12.500
 I did not know I had 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.749
 buckley textile collecting the 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.699
 all the classics that you can 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.709
 aam can you go and buy this 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.779
 is complete 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.779
 with your missile 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.459
 and you can see that those who suffer is this 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.069
 this spaceship 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.139
 so they can see that she is cheeta chinche 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.139
 every one here you notice what is the bullet train part 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.399
 because it is that we are otan add a train is in tibu and played very g1 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.399
 but rather on a bullet train 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.259
 here you can fly 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.999
 these tires 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.739
 if it can be removed 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.879
 the people 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.260
 this crying asean + jean-marie suspend 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 also movable as much as they can 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.539
 but 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:08.529
 others can see efe 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.469
 it's almost perfect the way it looks 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:12.850
 the mute 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.949
 the new space 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.949
 how rebels and prisoners have their hologram inc 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.149
 so they left in 2006 although if they were not called construction 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.339
 little different 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.259
 they are two penthouses 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.359
 but the revision is classist in 2006 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.399
 two first classics that started to come out 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.229
 i chile 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.629
 part of the collection 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.029
 everything goes 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.009
 ee 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.239
 another way there will be an end the first thing we're going to go 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.749
 is to transform it in its way 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.149
 ccoo bullet train 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.349
 what you have to do is first turn the back wing here and open it 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.119
 this way 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.869
 I read here 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.869
 grafts to get low 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:06.509
 put it to dyn 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:09.629
 sultans sherd leaves the bullet train 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.929
 turn it around 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:12.129
 and join them 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.189
 both of them 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.189
 here the opposite 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.699
 this way 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.659
 we do not think 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.990
 we give you a rotation here 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.470
 annoyed by the rockets 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.590
 like these panels 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.219
 are the wings 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.080
 for these and others 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.909
 and we put the gun 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:36.930
 I live 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.979
 and they have it 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.979
 Castro brakes his bullet train mode 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.659
 and you can see it 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.020
 2 83 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.169
 i for now very well 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.659
 it is a bullet train 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.379
 with your shot 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.330
 very good this figure 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.139
 the star as what counts 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.110
 and now abuse transform it into its robbers way 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.110
 only that a choice of lakes 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:10.569
 extend this these powerful fuselages 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.229
 to remove them 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.120
 pieces like stepánek fifth 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.069
 waiters with nazi estepona 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.309
 spinning gave turn and the Senate 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.949
 inform that prevents 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.949
 we will do the same thing k 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.809
 this way 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.430
 we have adopted this is part of the album by way its chest 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.379
 cc quaranta 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.150
 this the cold front parts of the bullet train 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.939
 the turn 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.490
 to form your arm 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.340
 we take this part of the bullet train to be able to bend and on the elbow 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.620
 the fuel arm 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.620
 we expect the same thing k 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.599
 we do not open this back panel 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.379
 we put out our heads 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:04.919
 we passed the panel 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.539
 we put the room is back and this one four as subtitles 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.210
 Of course 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.710
 I saw here they have it 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.129
 to your forehead 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.129
 in its way 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.509
 and I could see what 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.619
 a very simple figure anyway 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:29.779
 and it's a classic 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.800
 this one must have in his collection 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.830
 the genk and 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.189
 per hundred of this the Japanese version of this one to suffer 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.999
 It is painted in gray with purple 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.879
 He recommended a lot and I did not get it, I hope 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:45.819
 someday get it because this 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.819
 painted according to the crops 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.639
 the three bridges 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.129
 in this case the jiménez test 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.020
 boehner crew in the arms 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.689
 also double x 1 in the knee 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.419
 and movement 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.419
 circulatory aena on the court 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.999
 an excellent collection figure 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:11.119
 if you have not got it which considers and used on ebay 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.469
 a club or in your profile 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:15.710
 totally 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.439
 it's worth it as part 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:20.689
 from the collection of the classics 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.689
 there they have the classic suffer 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.240
 what about tecate like my camera latina borrowed 

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.729
 but although I have to agree with him 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:34.849
 came to have more loved for a hundred Spanish very soon in this 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:35.680
 week 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.950
 tomorrow they will pick up a package of mine 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.710
 in that package I have an omen since 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.080
 already when kaka 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.509
 lugo 11 of the rivers of its two 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.749
 here I lack the live of stars because of the unpredictability 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.999
 celje 2 

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:55.610
 we abandon that the peron auroristas 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.539
 I left the figure in the pool 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:58.869
 that is to say 

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:01.830
 merkel offices of navarra by a 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.699
 put the psuv batteries 

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:05.869
 the meeting also 

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:07.129
 for now 

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.719
 by the way that and borowski see you until the next
