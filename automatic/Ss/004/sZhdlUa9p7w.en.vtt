little<00:01:40.369> over<00:01:40.520> halfway<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:41.210> then<00:01:41.750> we<00:01:41.810> got<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
little over halfway and then we got the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.639 
little over halfway and then we got the

we<00:01:45.770> could<00:01:45.920> set<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.250> over<00:01:46.549> to<00:01:46.670> flat<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:49.840> which

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
we could set that over to flat and which

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:00.550 
we could set that over to flat and which
will<00:01:51.020> offer<00:01:51.229> no<00:01:51.590> EQ<00:01:52.159> curve<00:01:52.579> at<00:01:52.700> all

which<00:02:13.440> obviously<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:14.099> very<00:02:14.250> bassy<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> we're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
which obviously is very bassy so we're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.180 
which obviously is very bassy so we're
gonna<00:02:16.650> set<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.980> back<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.129> bright<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.799> turn<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
gonna set it back to bright and turn the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:31.240 
gonna set it back to bright and turn the
game<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.970> little<00:02:21.239> bit

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.119 

just<00:02:32.250> got<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.550> very<00:02:32.790> cool<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:34.260> ban<00:02:34.500> tone<00:02:34.800> like

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
just got that very cool to ban tone like

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.309 
just got that very cool to ban tone like
an<00:02:35.280> amp<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.819> turned<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.300> five<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.569> six

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
an amp that's turned up to five or six

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.050 
an amp that's turned up to five or six
but<00:02:37.800> actually<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.280> Princeton<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.700> only<00:02:38.879> turned

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
but actually my Princeton is only turned

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.430 
but actually my Princeton is only turned
up<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.330> about<00:02:39.480> two<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.840> half<00:02:39.870> right<00:02:40.290> now

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
up to about two and a half right now

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.699 
up to about two and a half right now
here<00:02:41.250> I've<00:02:41.430> got<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> gain<00:02:41.970> dimed<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:43.440> bright

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
here I've got the gain dimed the bright

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.250 
here I've got the gain dimed the bright
switch<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.180> volume<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.019> little

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
switch on and the volume just a little

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.890 
switch on and the volume just a little
over<00:02:46.440> halfway<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.280> you'll<00:02:47.849> hear<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.300> quite

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
over halfway and you'll hear it's quite

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
over halfway and you'll hear it's quite
distorted<00:02:49.380> almost<00:02:50.069> fuzz<00:02:50.370> tone

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:08.680 

you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.180 

Oh

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:37.930 
you
Oh

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.619 

and<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.330> will<00:03:39.450> sustain<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.110> feedback<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:41.629> of

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
and it will sustain and feedback and of

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.660 
and it will sustain and feedback and of
course<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.500> pedal<00:03:43.769> cranked<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.310> can<00:03:44.550> use

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
course with the pedal cranked I can use

00:03:44.670 --> 00:04:09.740 
course with the pedal cranked I can use
my<00:03:44.849> guitars<00:03:45.180> volume<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.959> dial<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.319> down

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.270 

you<00:04:10.750> could<00:04:10.930> also<00:04:11.079> use<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.470> manifold<00:04:11.829> drive<00:04:12.040> as

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
you could also use the manifold drive as

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.240 
you could also use the manifold drive as
a<00:04:12.340> clean<00:04:12.849> boost<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.530> here's<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.860> amp<00:04:15.069> without

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
a clean boost so here's the amp without

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.400 
a clean boost so here's the amp without
the<00:04:15.549> effect<00:04:17.489> with<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:22.389> I<00:04:22.449> set<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.110> gain

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
the effect with it so I set the gain

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.820 
the effect with it so I set the gain
just<00:04:24.190> barely<00:04:24.460> on<00:04:24.699> I<00:04:25.000> put<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.080> switch<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
just barely on I put the switch to the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:37.200 
just barely on I put the switch to the
flat<00:04:27.070> EQ<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:28.210> volume<00:04:28.630> is<00:04:28.750> dime<00:04:29.020> doubt<00:04:36.210> so

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
flat EQ and the volume is dime doubt so

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.670 
flat EQ and the volume is dime doubt so
we<00:04:37.360> ask<00:04:37.509> more<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> tube<00:04:38.289> amp<00:04:38.500> that's

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
we ask more like a tube amp that's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.700 
we ask more like a tube amp that's
cranked<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.100> ten<00:04:40.169> well<00:04:41.169> there<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.380> have<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.650> a

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
cranked to ten well there you have it a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.230 
cranked to ten well there you have it a
