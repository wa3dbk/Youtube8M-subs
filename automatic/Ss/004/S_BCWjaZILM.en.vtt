00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.730
 nickel 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.620
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.960
 new video so on gta 5 for the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 presentation of the new dlc so in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 this video i will show you the price 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.269
 of all new vehicles with a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.400
 little before taste so new 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.810
 camouflage so let's go we'll go 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 on the website which is right here 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.800
 in the long dish we will go directly on 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.019
 edit ah if you are going to have a very 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.939
 big surprise look at the gift price of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 the udc comes out of luxury so the plane mass 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.019
 with the solid gold plane costs 10 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.090
 millions of dollars which frankly that's 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.550
 really abused then here one to the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 follow luxury this one costs 5 million 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 hundred and fifty thousand dollars hawks who 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 is not given either after what is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 cool with them with the plane is that it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 there are still eight places in it so 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.840
 with your friends it would be a little more 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 funny the helicopter only features him 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.640
 four places so that will be a little more 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 limited then we will go to the new 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.449
 vehicle so in the legendary motors 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 who is right here at the plane the more you 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.030
 can also see that the site has changed 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
 frankly they made a new 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.859
 design and the really stylish ones so the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 left four new vehicles 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 four new cars here we have the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.260
 gas peace osiris so a million nine 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.150
 one hundred and fifty thousand dollars so 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 almost 2 million which is not 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 given but we can see that the car 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.430
 is really stylish look there we have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.659
 parts and the new presentation of the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.110
 site with small pictures like that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.540
 frankly it's really stylish then 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.530
 here we have the bd factors sterling I was 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.420
 at $ 975 1000 like two flat spots 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 with the small pictures the doors like 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.970
 that too that opens is the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.979
 frankly it's really a dinguerie 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 then here we went to albanie virgo so 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.369
 195 thousand dollars according to my opinion it's 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 the vehicle that costs the least in 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 this update so a small vehicle 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 who frankly he has nothing of them 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.090
 nothing special it is still 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 enough town you did not really have way 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.180
 well the custom this one but it's 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.659
 compare to other vehicles it's not 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.780
 really a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 it's not really great and here we go 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.310
 so finish with the the most vehicle 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.170
 the most what the fuck is there and null 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.509
 windsor so eight hundred and forty five 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 thousand dollars 2 places but this one 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.990
 look at we have camouflages that change 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.640
 so as we could see that still 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.479
 rockstar announced the dlc 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.540
 we have the first shot 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.980
 the monogram stopped in has nine so hop 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.230
 she is like that then we have the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.390
 second in white with small logos 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.290
 two colors here she is this one at 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.799
 heaven and not bad with little ones 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.970
 triangles enal to ninja yeti in color 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.930
 monochrome camouflage perceived so in 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.629
 brown with little white men 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.430
 like that there monochrome perceived this worm 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.540
 like the same small patterns but with 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.220
 this time upside down so it's not 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.299
 terrible but in my opinion we can 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190
 surely change the colors where 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.180
 go this custom 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.700
 then we have this one who is really 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.019
 beautiful laguÃ« by sotoca bras it's 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.129
 good it's a little weird but I 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.420
 find it's pretty damn flashy like 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.099
 that and maybe even for shopping or 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.170
 what for the videos it can really 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.510
 be stylish and we'll finish with the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.609
 python probably at 4 so and just 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.049
 here the car has snake camouflage 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.780
 like that a little too a little luxury 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.489
 frankly it's really stylish then 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.230
 what else is there at the Bartok level ? 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.510
 we have nothing else so here we have the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.609
 messin but this one was already at 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.680
 level of the boats are not new 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.049
 boats and then at the level so the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.530
 site that's right here no new 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.910
 vehicles 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.099
 I will go down to the level of 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.389
 like motorcycles there the site page has 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.989
 changed frankly it's really stylish 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.090
 that they did that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.130
 I hope the 6 g guys it's not 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.150
 just for that at the highest level of 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.760
 motorcycles and or no there is no 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.109
 new bikes and then so there I 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.519
 will show you the vehicles that are 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.730
 just here so here we have all the new ones 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.959
 camouflage flat boxer the sky is 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.069
 really stylus like that in pink and 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.169
 I hope we can change the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.700
 colors see a little what it gives 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:42.340
 lorna this one the para gay version which 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.250
 here is it if I found show 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.800
 hostile and this with my underwear look 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.480
 so this one this one perso I do not like 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.490
 too there too so this one is the one 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.450
 we had seen that rockstar announced on 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.400
 dlc that's the camouflage so not the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.050
 rare paint but that's the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.790
 camouflage snake hop here and there we have them 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.600
 vehicles with doors that open 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.209
 normally in the air here it is 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.540
 stylish little door like that look 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.769
 and here it is a good little 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.329
 novelty frankly it really does 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.820
 pleasure to see stuff that changes a 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.080
 little in the game this one this is it 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 we had seen on the crime of rock 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.240
 on the screen excuse me from rockstar and 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 this one sees the most beautiful in my 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.640
 notice the same with the doors that 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.900
 open like that hop the magnificent and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.100
 So here we come to the end of this 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.700
 little video I really hope she 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.440
