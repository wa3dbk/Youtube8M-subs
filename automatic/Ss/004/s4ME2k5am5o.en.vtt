00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
seconds um show you all this sideshow so

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.099 
seconds um show you all this sideshow so
basically<00:00:14.700> tells<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.150> basic<00:00:15.780> features

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
basically tells you the basic features

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.010 
basically tells you the basic features
so<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> has<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.039> controller<00:00:17.730> over<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:18.510> it's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
so it has the controller over here it's

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.429 
so it has the controller over here it's
left<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.500> right-handed<00:00:20.119> like<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.330> body<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
left or right-handed like that body you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.830 
left or right-handed like that body you
know<00:00:22.640> proportional<00:00:23.640> server<00:00:23.910> steering

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
know proportional server steering

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500 
know proportional server steering
everything<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.340> also<00:00:26.460> change<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
everything and you can also change the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
everything and you can also change the
frequency<00:00:27.990> crystals<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.010> very<00:00:29.279> useful

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
frequency crystals which is very useful

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.530 
frequency crystals which is very useful
for<00:00:29.660> racing<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.470> six<00:00:31.679> pounds<00:00:32.070> so

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
for racing which is up to six pounds so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.590 
for racing which is up to six pounds so
as<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:36.510> yeah

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
that's the cards off the controller

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.690 
that's the cards off the controller
charger<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.469> battery<00:00:40.500> pack<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.370> also

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
charger and a battery pack it is also

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.319 
charger and a battery pack it is also
clearly<00:00:42.600> stated<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:44.059> packaging<00:00:45.059> itself

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
its down let's say thank you to me that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
its down let's say thank you to me that
this<00:01:54.600> way<00:01:57.110> say<00:01:58.110> unless<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.450> there<00:02:00.450> are<00:02:00.570> some

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this way say unless that there are some

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.350 
this way say unless that there are some
basic<00:02:01.399> toggles<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.549> off<00:02:03.350> that's<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.560> smooth

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
basic toggles on off that's very smooth

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.619 
basic toggles on off that's very smooth
for<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.540> antenna

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
for the antenna

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.890 
for the antenna
I<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> steering<00:02:11.640> wheel<00:02:11.900> forward

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
I think that's a steering wheel forward

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.750 
I think that's a steering wheel forward
reverse<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.410> doing

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
reverse is doing

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.050 
reverse is doing
so<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.209> has<00:02:14.390> got<00:02:14.690> tuning<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:16.040> fix<00:02:16.849> it

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so it has got tuning so you can fix it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.500 
so it has got tuning so you can fix it
remotely<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.610> provide<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.120> with<00:02:20.299> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
remotely if you provide you with a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.990 
remotely if you provide you with a
Nicole<00:02:21.670> 9-volt<00:02:22.670> battery<00:02:23.090> ah<00:02:26.709> yes<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.819> is

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
Nicole 9-volt battery ah yes this is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.550 
Nicole 9-volt battery ah yes this is
going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.239> do<00:02:29.330> with<00:02:29.450> body<00:02:29.599> pins<00:02:29.959> I<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.349> serve

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
going to do with body pins I can serve

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.039 
going to do with body pins I can serve
up<00:02:30.739> um<00:02:31.040> I'm<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.150> sure<00:02:32.209> what<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.660> does<00:02:32.690> though

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
up um I'm not sure what it does though

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.660 
up um I'm not sure what it does though
