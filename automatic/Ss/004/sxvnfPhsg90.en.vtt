00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.400 

the<00:00:33.480> goal<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.810> particular<00:00:33.960> piece<00:00:34.380> was

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the goal of this particular piece was

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
the goal of this particular piece was
one<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.830> the<00:00:34.920> dive<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> legal<00:00:35.700> engine

universe with a bigger more diverse cast
I<00:00:38.630> think<00:00:39.630> it's<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.900> about<00:00:40.080> flushing<00:00:41.040> things

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I think it's just about flushing things

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
storytelling because it's animation so

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.440 
storytelling because it's animation so
there's<00:04:06.350> no<00:04:06.620> production<00:04:07.130> track<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:08.120> start
