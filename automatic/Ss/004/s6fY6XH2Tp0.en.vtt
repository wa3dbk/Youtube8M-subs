00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
Washington I do think George Washington

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.660 
Washington I do think George Washington

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
will have the upper hand because a ten
was<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> superior<00:00:39.270> conference<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
was a superior conference to the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
was a superior conference to the
American<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:40.829> honestly<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.489> george

washington's<00:00:42.840> face<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.260> bunch<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> good

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
washington's face a bunch of good

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
washington's face a bunch of good
opponents<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> held<00:00:44.969> their<00:00:45.149> own<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.719> think

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
opponents and held their own so i think

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
opponents and held their own so i think
that<00:00:46.079> they'll<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.320> fine<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.129> moving

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that they'll be fine in this one moving

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.750 
that they'll be fine in this one moving
on<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> round<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.059> 32<00:00:49.340> harvard<00:00:50.340> lost<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
on to the round of 32 harvard lost to

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900 
on to the round of 32 harvard lost to
you<00:00:51.000> khan<00:00:51.510> by<00:00:52.050> five<00:00:52.379> points<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.160> Cincinnati

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you khan by five points and Cincinnati

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.560 
you khan by five points and Cincinnati
loss<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> uconn<00:00:54.510> twice<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.710> therefore<00:00:56.340> i<00:00:56.969> think

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
loss to uconn twice so therefore i think

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.939 
loss to uconn twice so therefore i think
that<00:00:57.809> Harvard<00:00:58.320> will<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.559> able<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> beat

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that Harvard will be able to beat

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
that Harvard will be able to beat
Cincinnati<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.989> whole

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
Cincinnati it's not really that whole

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
Cincinnati it's not really that whole
reason<00:01:01.530> why<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.120> said<00:01:03.390> think

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
reason why but I do like I said think

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
reason why but I do like I said think
the<00:01:03.870> American<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.830> good

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the American was not very good

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
the American was not very good
conference<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.880> Harvard<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.479> come

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
conference and I think Harvard will come

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
conference and I think Harvard will come
out<00:01:06.869> try<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> prove<00:01:08.100> something<00:01:08.520> man<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.150> you're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out try to prove something man if you're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.850

any<00:01:09.479> team<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> nation<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
any team in the nation right now do you

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
any team in the nation right now do you
really<00:01:11.130> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.430> playing<00:01:11.549> Michigan<00:01:11.909> State

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
really want to be playing Michigan State

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
really want to be playing Michigan State
I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:13.200> dello<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.860> decent<00:01:14.280> team<00:01:14.490> but

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I think dello is a decent team but

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.700 
I think dello is a decent team but
Michigan<00:01:15.570> State<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.990> came<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.560> in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
Michigan State they came out here in

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
Michigan State they came out here in

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
obliterated Michigan today and I thought

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.850 
obliterated Michigan today and I thought
they're<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> number<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.500> seed

you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.800> see<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.220> hi<00:02:38.519> kind<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.360> hastily<00:02:39.780> put

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
you can see there hi kind of hastily put

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
you can see there hi kind of hastily put
UConn's<00:02:40.560> name<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.340> think

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
UConn's name in there but I do think

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.550 
UConn's name in there but I do think
that<00:02:41.730> they're<00:02:41.910> gonna<00:02:41.970> beat<00:02:42.209> st.<00:02:42.480> Jews<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.989> think

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
that they're gonna beat st. Jews I think

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080 
that they're gonna beat st. Jews I think
st.<00:02:43.950> Joe's<00:02:44.160> he's<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> bad<00:02:44.610> match<00:02:44.850> it

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
st. Joe's he's got a bad match it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.420 
st. Joe's he's got a bad match it
because<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.840> cons<00:02:46.050> really<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.739> seven-seat

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
because you cons really not a seven-seat

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.710 
because you cons really not a seven-seat
they<00:02:47.580> should<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.850> ranked<00:02:48.090> much<00:02:48.239> higher<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.600> my

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
they should be ranked much higher in my

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.850 
they should be ranked much higher in my
opinion<00:02:50.180> Nova<00:02:51.180> who<00:02:51.330> was<00:02:51.450> very<00:02:51.660> very<00:02:52.019> close<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
opinion Nova who was very very close to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.830 
opinion Nova who was very very close to
being<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.100> number<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.519> seed<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.690> they

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
being a number one seed I think they

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.990 
being a number one seed I think they
should<00:02:55.019> have<00:02:55.050> no<00:02:55.230> problem<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.560> Milwaukee

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
should have no problem with Milwaukee

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.580 
should have no problem with Milwaukee
they<00:02:57.000> should<00:02:57.239> advance<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.750> around<00:02:57.900> 32<00:02:58.350> without

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
they should advance it around 32 without

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.280 
they should advance it around 32 without
many<00:02:58.769> problems<00:02:59.040> if<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.310> ask<00:02:59.459> me<00:03:00.290> George

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290

think Virginia with her I think they're

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.180 
think Virginia with her I think they're
on<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> very<00:03:16.079> hot<00:03:16.290> streak<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.829> into<00:03:17.130> this

because I think that DeAndre Kane it's
just<00:04:41.889> gonna<00:04:41.949> be<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.160> difference<00:04:42.460> maker<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.789> that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970
