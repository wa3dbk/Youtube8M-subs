the barber man calm and today I'm going
to<00:00:08.370> attempt<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.880> explain<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.630> reason<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
to attempt to explain the reason it is

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.950 
to attempt to explain the reason it is
that<00:00:11.040> us<00:00:11.400> hair<00:00:11.670> clippers<00:00:12.090> make<00:00:12.390> a<00:00:12.420> terrible

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that us hair clippers make a terrible

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.590 
that us hair clippers make a terrible
bang<00:00:13.200> noise<00:00:13.500> when<00:00:14.220> operated<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.570> a

that<00:00:22.680> I'm<00:00:23.190> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.520> everyday

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
that I'm going to use everyday

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.760 
that I'm going to use everyday
situations<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> then<00:00:26.730> slowly<00:00:27.270> progress

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
situations and then slowly progress

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.560 
situations and then slowly progress
slightly<00:00:28.770> more<00:00:28.949> technical<00:00:29.190> to<00:00:30.060> work<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
slightly more technical to work you in

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
slightly more technical to work you in
slowly<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> understand<00:00:31.830> why<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.609> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
slowly so you understand why this is so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.350 
slowly so you understand why this is so
let's<00:00:33.539> do<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.670> mechanical<00:00:35.670> movement<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.270> a

human a kangaroo's mechanical movement

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
human a kangaroo's mechanical movement
would<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> hop<00:00:49.500> hop<00:00:50.309> hop<00:00:51.090> hop<00:00:52.309> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
would be to hop hop hop hop the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
mechanical movement of a hair clipper is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
mechanical movement of a hair clipper is
made<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.230> legs<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:59.040> arms<00:00:59.790> you<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
made up of not legs but arms you have a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.979 
made up of not legs but arms you have a
fixed<00:01:00.690> arm<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.200> a<00:01:02.100> moving<00:01:02.520> arm<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
fixed arm and a moving arm and the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.430 
fixed arm and a moving arm and the
natural<00:01:04.939> thing<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.630> been<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:07.079> fixed

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
natural thing this has been the fixed

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.060 
natural thing this has been the fixed
arm<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.190> one<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.640> being<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:10.070> moving

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
arm and this one here being the moving

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.430 
arm and this one here being the moving
arm<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.820> move<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:14.090> towards<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.360> fixed<00:01:16.110> arm

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
arm is to move in towards the fixed arm

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.399 
arm is to move in towards the fixed arm
but<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.580> importantly<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.750> moving<00:01:19.170> arm

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
but more importantly the moving arm

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
but more importantly the moving arm
moves<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> fixed<00:01:20.610> arm<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.600> before

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
moves to the fixed arm and just before

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.070 
moves to the fixed arm and just before
it<00:01:22.229> gets<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> fixed<00:01:23.130> arm<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.880> returns<00:01:24.330> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it gets to the fixed arm it returns just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.120 
it gets to the fixed arm it returns just
before<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> gets<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> fix<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.970> returns

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
before it gets to the fix on it returns

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
before it gets to the fix on it returns
that's<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.369> natural<00:01:29.549> reaction<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.960> going

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that's the natural reaction now going

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.960 
that's the natural reaction now going
back<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.310> earlier<00:01:33.290> explanation<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.500> video

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
back to my earlier explanation or video

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.020 
back to my earlier explanation or video
basically<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> hurt<00:01:36.390> egde<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.520> speed

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
basically the hurt egde is the speed

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.940 
basically the hurt egde is the speed
which<00:01:39.990> these<00:01:40.500> arms<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> these<00:01:41.580> blades<00:01:42.000> move

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
which these arms and these blades move

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
which these arms and these blades move
so<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.540> us<00:01:45.540> hair<00:01:46.049> clipper<00:01:46.409> requires<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.490> 60

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so this us hair clipper requires a 60

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170 
so this us hair clipper requires a 60
Hertz<00:01:48.299> cycle<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:49.200> means<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.740> faster<00:01:50.400> than

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Hertz cycle which means it's faster than

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.670 
Hertz cycle which means it's faster than
what<00:01:51.930> comes<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.950> UK<00:01:53.400> which<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.790> 50<00:01:54.299> Hertz

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
what comes in the UK which is 50 Hertz

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.179 
what comes in the UK which is 50 Hertz
so<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> show<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> mechanical

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
so just to show you the mechanical

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.889 
so just to show you the mechanical
movement<00:01:59.790> actually<00:02:00.119> work<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.869> my

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
movement actually work and when I put my

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.590 
movement actually work and when I put my
screwdriver<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.369> Clipper<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> move<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
screwdriver in the Clipper and move this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740 
screwdriver in the Clipper and move this
arm<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.119> bottom

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
arm you will see that are the bottom

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.889 
arm you will see that are the bottom
blade<00:02:06.960> moving<00:02:07.710> from<00:02:08.159> left<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.700> right<00:02:09.119> left<00:02:09.659> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
blade moving from left to right left to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.999 
blade moving from left to right left to
right

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
right

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.649 
right
-<00:02:11.129> right<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.700> what<00:02:12.000> happens<00:02:12.360> when<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
- right so this is what happens when you

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.910 
- right so this is what happens when you
power<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:13.430> now<00:02:14.870> 50<00:02:15.870> Hertz<00:02:16.110> where<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.830> are

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
power it up now 50 Hertz where we are

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.180 
power it up now 50 Hertz where we are
plugged<00:02:17.310> into<00:02:17.549> right<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.720> when<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.739> moving

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
plugged into right now when this moving

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.030 
plugged into right now when this moving
arm<00:02:20.459> moves<00:02:20.940> towards<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.510> fixed<00:02:22.080> arm<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
arm moves towards the fixed arm the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.390 
arm moves towards the fixed arm the
reaction<00:02:23.909> is<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.510> quick<00:02:25.049> enough<00:02:25.379> for<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.159> to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
reaction is not quick enough for it to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.479 
reaction is not quick enough for it to

moves towards fixed arm the reaction is

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.140 
moves towards fixed arm the reaction is
not<00:02:33.629> quick<00:02:33.900> enough<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.440> 50<00:02:34.950> Hertz<00:02:35.129> as<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> result

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
not quick enough at 50 Hertz as a result

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.440 
not quick enough at 50 Hertz as a result
it<00:02:36.360> bends<00:02:37.049> at<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.590> end<00:02:37.829> now<00:02:38.819> the<00:02:38.879> terrible

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
it bends at the end now the terrible

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.960 
it bends at the end now the terrible
noise<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.930> hear<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.310> basically

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
noise that you hear is that basically

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.880 
noise that you hear is that basically
banging<00:02:42.420> banging<00:02:42.840> banging<00:02:43.049> banging<00:02:43.680> banging

banging banging banging banging banging

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.830 
banging banging banging banging banging
so<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.579> putting<00:02:44.849> a<00:02:44.879> lot<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> pressure

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
so it's putting a lot of pressure

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080 
so it's putting a lot of pressure
I<00:02:45.980> wanted<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> clip<00:02:47.280> up<00:02:47.459> because<00:02:47.910> it's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
I wanted to clip up because it's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.910 
I wanted to clip up because it's
continuously<00:02:48.750> banging<00:02:49.200> because<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.530> doesn't

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
continuously banging because it doesn't

continuously banging because it doesn't
react<00:02:50.190> quickly<00:02:50.489> enough<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:51.269> you're<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> your

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
react quickly enough if you're in your

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.160 
react quickly enough if you're in your
car<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.000> you're<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.480> rear<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> another

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
car and you're at the rear of another

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.199 
car and you're at the rear of another
car<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.829> do<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.129> hit<00:02:56.340> your<00:02:56.459> brakes<00:02:56.849> in

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
car and you do not hit your brakes in

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.229 
car and you do not hit your brakes in
time<00:02:57.480> you're<00:02:58.079> going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> bang<00:02:58.650> into<00:02:59.609> the<00:03:00.000> rear

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
time you're going to bang into the rear

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.690 
time you're going to bang into the rear
of<00:03:00.269> somebody<00:03:00.900> else<00:03:01.140> that's<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.829> same<00:03:02.069> 50

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
of somebody else that's the same 50

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.650 
of somebody else that's the same 50
Hertz<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.599> reaction<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.950> quick<00:03:05.280> enough

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
Hertz the reaction is not quick enough

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.309 
Hertz the reaction is not quick enough
so<00:03:06.660> when<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.430> turn<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.640> clipper<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.090> 50<00:03:09.900> Hertz

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
so when I turn this clipper on 50 Hertz

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:19.170 
so when I turn this clipper on 50 Hertz
you'll<00:03:10.500> hear<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.890> terrible<00:03:11.129> noise

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.850 

like<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> said<00:03:20.360> that's<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.380> reaction

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
like I said that's because the reaction

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.850 
like I said that's because the reaction
is<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.190> slow<00:03:22.900> bang-bang-bang<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.620> keeps

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
is so slow bang-bang-bang it keeps

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.320 
is so slow bang-bang-bang it keeps
hitting<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.310> because<00:03:25.580> if<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.849> reaction<00:03:26.300> is

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
hitting it because if the reaction is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.150 
hitting it because if the reaction is
too<00:03:26.569> slow<00:03:26.870> when<00:03:27.800> we<00:03:27.950> take<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.400> from<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:30.040> 50<00:03:31.040> Hertz

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
too slow when we take it from a 50 Hertz

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.780 
too slow when we take it from a 50 Hertz
cycle<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.420> plug<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.870> into<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.860> 60<00:03:34.340> Hertz<00:03:34.370> cycle

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
cycle and plug it into a 60 Hertz cycle

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.300 
cycle and plug it into a 60 Hertz cycle
which<00:03:35.510> comes<00:03:35.810> from<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.110> frequency<00:03:36.530> 60<00:03:37.099> Hertz

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
which comes from the frequency 60 Hertz

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.690 
which comes from the frequency 60 Hertz
converter<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:41.720> operates<00:03:42.230> normally<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
converter it operates normally and the

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.880 
converter it operates normally and the
reason<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.269> operating<00:03:44.900> normally<00:03:45.500> is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
reason it's operating normally is

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.330 
reason it's operating normally is
because<00:03:46.459> at<00:03:47.120> 60<00:03:47.780> Hertz<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.650> faster

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
because at 60 Hertz it's a faster

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.320 
because at 60 Hertz it's a faster
movement<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.450> faster<00:03:51.410> movement<00:03:52.010> will<00:03:52.489> allow<00:03:53.000> a

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
movement a faster movement will allow a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.710 
movement a faster movement will allow a
quicker<00:03:53.870> reaction<00:03:54.560> as<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.430> result<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.299> moving

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
quicker reaction as a result the moving

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.070 
quicker reaction as a result the moving
arm<00:03:56.959> moves<00:03:57.560> towards<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.069> fix<00:03:58.370> arm<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.080> just

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
arm moves towards the fix arm and just

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.350 
arm moves towards the fix arm and just
before<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.709> hits<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.160> because<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.730> reaction

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
before it hits it because the reaction

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.199 
before it hits it because the reaction
is<00:04:02.540> fast<00:04:02.900> enough<00:04:03.140> it<00:04:03.799> returns<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.670> this

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
is fast enough it returns and this

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.140 
is fast enough it returns and this
creates<00:04:05.680> smooth<00:04:06.680> movement<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.430> your<00:04:07.910> blades

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
creates smooth movement of your blades

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.539 
creates smooth movement of your blades
and<00:04:08.510> smooth<00:04:09.019> movement<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.860> mechanics<00:04:10.340> in

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
and smooth movement of the mechanics in
