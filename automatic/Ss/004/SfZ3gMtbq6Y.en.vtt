00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.340
 and any magician can throw a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.350
 spell or two and some can that 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.690
 they even study enough to 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.739
 become groups but only the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.170
 most talented 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.140
 he is allowed to be recognized as a magician 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.750
 however as in any circle of 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.330
 sorcerers the meaning of the community 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.970
 never guarantees that the competition is 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.830
 polite even being mushroom ready 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.380
 renown and a great scholar 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.030
 world of sorcery to ruben never 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.190
 it had crossed his mind that maybe 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.870
 had wood to be a wizards up 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.239
 find yourself in the middle of your seventh 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.220
 intent and murder where before the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.200
 sound of a snap of fingers or a 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.840
 hand wrapped in flames would have 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.960
 done jumping for joy now all 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 he had become very predictable he craved 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.690
 have a greater competition for that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.310
 donning his combat mask and 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.860
 just that any luxury that I would like 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 rise in rank would he announced his 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 intentions to kill a magicians 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.219
 but ruby did not take long to discover that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.950
 threatened magicians are supposed to threaten the 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.780
 to all and all of them corresponded 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 with forcefulness 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.229
 each enemy enchantment was a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.030
 unstoppable torrent of energy and each 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 attack a lethal blow well calculated 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 but then something happened that the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.009
 rubik's enemies did not expect their arts 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.710
 they seemed to turn against them in the middle 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.469
 of that magical ruby triad believed between 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.840
 teeth reading and subtly replicating 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.750
 the powers of one to throw them against 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.030
 another sowing chaos among those who 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.369
 they had allied against him they started to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.470
 accusations of treason and to the little 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.640
 the sorcerers became 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.950
 against the others 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.860
 without suspecting who was behind 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.970
 supervision when the battle concluded 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.739
 finally everyone was 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.180
 embraced frozen soaked cut 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.160
 drilled more than one already dead 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 for the arts of a ruby ally 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.569
 He remained part sore but delighted 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.730
 with the show nobody had the 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.250
 forces to discuss when he presented his 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.600
 petition for a solution to the public council 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.180
 and all 11 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 substantial parties agreed to grant 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.000
 the title of great magician and that's how 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.000
 ruby became the great magicians
