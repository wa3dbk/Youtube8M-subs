hi<00:00:05.890> I'm<00:00:06.280> Kent<00:00:06.520> with<00:00:06.700> Orion<00:00:06.790> telescopes<00:00:07.420> and

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
hi I'm Kent with Orion telescopes and

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.210 
hi I'm Kent with Orion telescopes and
binoculars<00:00:07.660> and<00:00:08.320> this<00:00:08.710> is<00:00:08.830> the<00:00:08.950> orion

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
binoculars and this is the orion

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.240 
binoculars and this is the orion
starshoot<00:00:09.550> video<00:00:10.150> eyepiece<00:00:10.540> -<00:00:10.870> it's<00:00:11.860> a<00:00:12.010> small

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
starshoot video eyepiece - it's a small

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.950 
starshoot video eyepiece - it's a small
video<00:00:12.490> camera<00:00:12.910> built<00:00:13.240> inside<00:00:13.630> an

video camera built inside an
inch-and-a-quarter<00:00:14.410> nozzle<00:00:15.250> so<00:00:15.519> it's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
inch-and-a-quarter nozzle so it's

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.179 
inch-and-a-quarter nozzle so it's
designed<00:00:16.209> to<00:00:16.360> sit<00:00:17.320> into<00:00:17.439> the<00:00:17.590> focuser<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.099> your

television VCR DVR so instead of looking
through<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.510> telescope<00:00:31.689> you<00:00:32.080> can<00:00:32.290> display

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
through the telescope you can display

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.189 
through the telescope you can display
the<00:00:33.340> image<00:00:33.610> on<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:34.330> large<00:00:34.570> television<00:00:34.989> screen

the image on a large television screen

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.170 
the image on a large television screen
it's<00:00:35.559> great<00:00:35.769> for<00:00:35.920> public<00:00:36.220> outreach<00:00:36.550> or<00:00:36.910> for

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
it's great for public outreach or for

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.049 
it's great for public outreach or for
friends<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.600> family<00:00:37.899> -<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.410> view<00:00:39.059> it's

friends and family - to view it's

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.540 
friends and family - to view it's
designed<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.720> look<00:00:40.870> at<00:00:41.110> solar<00:00:41.890> system<00:00:42.220> objects

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
designed to look at solar system objects

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.670 
designed to look at solar system objects
so<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.059> moon<00:00:43.270> and<00:00:43.570> very<00:00:43.719> good<00:00:43.840> detail<00:00:43.989> craters

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
so the moon and very good detail craters

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.370 
so the moon and very good detail craters
on<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.800> moon<00:00:45.270> planets<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.690> rings<00:00:46.840> of<00:00:46.960> Saturn

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
on the moon planets the rings of Saturn

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.340 
on the moon planets the rings of Saturn
moons<00:00:48.040> around<00:00:48.190> Jupiter<00:00:48.540> also<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.780> Sun<00:00:50.020> if<00:00:50.260> you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
moons around Jupiter also the Sun if you

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.450 
moons around Jupiter also the Sun if you
have<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.469> proper<00:00:50.739> solar<00:00:50.950> filter<00:00:51.280> on<00:00:51.370> the

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
have a proper solar filter on the

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.280 
have a proper solar filter on the
telescope<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:52.090> can<00:00:52.780> see<00:00:52.930> individual

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
telescope you can see individual

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.260 
telescope you can see individual
sunspots<00:00:53.770> with<00:00:53.950> something<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:54.219> those<00:00:54.340> and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
sunspots with something like those and

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.790 
sunspots with something like those and
also<00:00:55.420> during<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.809> day<00:00:55.960> -<00:00:56.020> if<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.410> just<00:00:56.559> wanted

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
also during the day - if you just wanted

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.380 
also during the day - if you just wanted
to<00:00:56.890> use<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.219> telescope<00:00:57.640> as<00:00:57.789> a<00:00:57.850> terrestrial

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
to use the telescope as a terrestrial

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.389 
to use the telescope as a terrestrial
spotter<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.530> record<00:00:59.860> the<00:00:59.980> view<00:01:00.160> out<00:01:00.280> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
spotter and record the view out the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.930 
spotter and record the view out the
window<00:01:00.430> this<00:01:00.969> would<00:01:01.120> work<00:01:01.239> very<00:01:01.300> well<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:03.340> in

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
window this would work very well it in

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.180 
window this would work very well it in
addition<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.270> the<00:01:04.449> RCA<00:01:05.199> video<00:01:05.590> plug<00:01:05.830> it's<00:01:06.009> got

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
addition to the RCA video plug it's got

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.320 
addition to the RCA video plug it's got
a<00:01:06.930> power<00:01:07.930> input<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.399> comes<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:09.789> the<00:01:09.910> AC<00:01:10.000> DC

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
a power input so it comes with the AC DC

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.609 
a power input so it comes with the AC DC
adapter<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:10.929> you<00:01:10.959> just<00:01:11.110> plug<00:01:11.259> it<00:01:11.410> into<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
adapter so you just plug it into the

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.040 
adapter so you just plug it into the
wall<00:01:11.649> for<00:01:12.039> power<00:01:12.509> again<00:01:13.509> inch-and-a-quarter

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
wall for power again inch-and-a-quarter

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.809 
wall for power again inch-and-a-quarter
nozzle<00:01:14.470> it's<00:01:14.619> threaded<00:01:14.950> for<00:01:15.100> filters<00:01:15.459> and

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
nozzle it's threaded for filters and

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.210 
nozzle it's threaded for filters and
it's<00:01:16.330> got<00:01:16.450> very<00:01:16.600> small<00:01:16.720> pixels<00:01:17.200> 5.6<00:01:17.800> micron

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
it's got very small pixels 5.6 micron

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.919 
it's got very small pixels 5.6 micron
pixels<00:01:18.399> so<00:01:18.789> it's<00:01:18.819> got<00:01:19.149> a<00:01:19.179> lot<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.420> resolution

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
pixels so it's got a lot of resolution

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.080 
pixels so it's got a lot of resolution
in<00:01:20.020> there<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:20.410> on<00:01:21.039> a<00:01:21.069> telescope<00:01:21.610> especially

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
in there so on a telescope especially

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.150 
in there so on a telescope especially
with<00:01:22.179> a<00:01:22.209> long<00:01:22.390> focal<00:01:22.660> length<00:01:22.780> or<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:23.979> even

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
with a long focal length or you can even

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.339 
with a long focal length or you can even
put<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.310> barlow<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.910> doubler<00:01:25.360> underneath<00:01:25.869> the

00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:26.349 
put a barlow a doubler underneath the

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.680 
put a barlow a doubler underneath the
