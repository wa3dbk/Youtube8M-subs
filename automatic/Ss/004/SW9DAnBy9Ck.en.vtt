00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 classic 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.830
 let's remove this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.530
 we are going to 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.630
 the box and here we have nothing else here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.160
 this comes a very nice box the futvp 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.910
 It comes with this little because we will 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.910
 take it out 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.190
 let's see what shows in the box brings 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 the control that is the control that these 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.450
 are going to use that one of the 57 buttons to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.840
 go up lower right left and the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 center to press ok the menu and pause 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.150
 and play 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.150
 in this we will see what more trailers 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.160
 it brings its very long connection cable is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.160
 good 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.670
 this is a script that nobody reads 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 to see if he brings busti kers 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.790
 He brought a cyclist everywhere 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.220
 and all these things that were there but 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.560
 you do not need it 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.560
 let's open the control 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.270
 the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.270
 the last generation battery 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.090
 the wire 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 Y 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.230
 and we will remove the rest 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.000
 that you can have as we already mentioned to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.420
 1080p backlight has netflix which is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.180
 something new 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 they are going to put the lawsuit of that then 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.180
 down here comes with this very good rubber 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.340
 so that the goal is sustained , 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.340
 go to move very resistant let's go 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.210
 the band around 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.530
 and on the other hand it 's very similar to lace 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.400
 and last here they have their 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.690
 this is the power mac and here you have 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.819
 a dpa cable 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.310
 hdmi that is not included then go 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.930
 to have to buy one here for mini 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.660
 optical and optical usb to audio but in 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.380
 connect your crop via wifi 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.710
 can tell it wired mind for a 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.540
 cable 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.380
 so if you compare it with the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.010
 past is equal changed is the internal 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.100
 It also comes with a new one with a new 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.310
 interface very similar to ios and if I've 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.650
 been in boxing the new apple tv if you already 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.270
 have the past not only recommend that 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.569
 I also accepted that they want the 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.560
 definition because as I say 1080p is 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:16.850
 almost like Murray is amazing 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:21.500
 audio everything is perfect 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.900
 and hopefully that's all give him like the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.300
 control all that they see like to share it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.819
 facebook twitter has installed 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.000
 subscribe to this magical channel we have not 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.000

 do not
