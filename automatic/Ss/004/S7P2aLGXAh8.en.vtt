00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.230
 It's a pleasure to estimate today's customers how to indicate how it works 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.669
 the multifunction mpro150 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.069
 with the contention ink system 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.069
 in the first instance we have to review 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.599
 the ink tank this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.130
 here I mean project 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 why these 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.909
 They must be 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.159
 separated 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.720
 so there's a pressure on me 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.980
 and can go down in the cartridges 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440
 Second instance 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 we have to review 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.220
 we have to review 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 if the crown is well placed 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.830
 as we can observe the hose correction ing a difficulty 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.080
 that is the position that the hose must be so that it does not get tangled 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.170
 We will send from the computer 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.060
 to the multifunction 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.000
 some impressions of weights to leave after checking the operation 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 mpro150 candle 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 as we can see at this moment is printing 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 some advertisements 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 with this we have finished the number one tutorial of how to use 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:21.629
 the multifunction third is canon with the system of 15 continued 40 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.699
 I listen to offers
