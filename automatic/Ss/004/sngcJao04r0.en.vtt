00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.670
 welcome to the channel today 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.500
 I bring the look you are seeing right now 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.590
 he approached them so you see it is a 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.270
 fuchsia look with very cute black and very 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.039
 fun to go out at night what 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.859
 finish animating like super lips 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.380
 super fuchsia I hope you like it very much 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.749
 the video that you enjoy it enough and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.029
 well i still keep trying how 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:34.400
 that balance the super being 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.290
 effervescent to the state would be then yes 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 some investment is because they have impro 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.260
 free or anything like that if what 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.930
 I'm trying to balance is and good 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.160
 let's see if we get it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 soon in all subjects the girls 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.329
 command a little kiss I hope you like it 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.129
 the video and the 243 chau chau we are going to 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.289
 start by placing as you want a pre 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.800
 trick for our shadows in this case 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.550
 I'm using a cream shadow 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.829
 skin color 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.559
 newt like who says but you can 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.339
 use a proofreader or a proof 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.110
 for eyes 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.170
 now let's take a shade of color 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.150
 fuchsia that is not going to give life to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.070
 our look and we're going to put it to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.400
 light touches to our eyelid 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.400
 mode 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.630
 without going over the basin 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.930
 then we do this step we take 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.710
 a light brown shadow and with a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.200
 brush type pen or pen type let's go 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.590
 to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.659
 just by placing this shadow where it is 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.219
 the cut that has already been created with the 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.909
 fuchsia shadow that we place with 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:48.159
 priority and we will upload it only one 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.679
 bit 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.679
 without reaching the beginning of our 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.860
 after this we are going to eliminate the cut 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.530
 with a brush to blur this 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.630
 brush girls or this brush that does not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 have absolutely no product 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.510
 we take a black shadow matte though if 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.360
 it's your taste of your preference can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.760
 also have brillito and let's do 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.760
 key 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.829
 will be a little bit a little bit 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.280
 more above the brown shadow that 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.280
 we use 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.519
 and since it's a black color, let's start 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.379
 to put little by little so you do not 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.680
 make us a blot or to be able 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.180
 if we fail to correct wrong not 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.330
 We will take it to the beginning of 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.430
 our eye but nothing more than half 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.430
 and we are going to go up little by little 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.890
 after doing this we place the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.740
 illuminator below the eyebrow and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.050
 we outline we take a brown shadow 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.740
 clarita and we will place it from the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.780
 tear to the middle of our eye and 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.690
 then we are going to take the black shadow that 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.920
 we used previously 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.360
 They are there and we will drop from 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.460
 half of our eye until the end to 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.150
 connect the colors 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.520
 after this a black pencil and we put 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.380
 our dust base that now I'm going to 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.380
