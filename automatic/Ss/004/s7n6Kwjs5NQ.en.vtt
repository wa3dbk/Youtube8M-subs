00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.210
 of savings since barrel 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.760
 this is a hard load case that I 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.820
 it came in this strange package of 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 aluminum from the USA sw box 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.059

 by the user's manual 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.380
 The user's manual includes how to use 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 the case that apart from charging protects 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.890
 how to load it how to be careful with 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.110
 when it's not in use and load them 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.800
 every so often if it is not in 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.240

 is everything that the case brings and a 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.220
 cable the microusb cable to be able

 top up and ready over there 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.979
 we can put the device and in a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.960
 moment we see that and close it of the same 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.340
 way sliding but to the side 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 opposite down 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.550
 Y 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.990
 to see how much it has charge 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.560
 we press the button in the part 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.759
 lower and it will show us four dots 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:13.900
 four means one hundred percent 375 250 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.329
 and 125 percent load 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.930
 let's load it by connecting it to the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.930
 computer 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.400
 as I mentioned earlier 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.379
 page is that double box where there 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.150
 very cheap prices and it is a page 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.150
 similar to my ex 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.420
 we remove loading the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.280
 and we see that when a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.830
 puntito means that you are loading 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.650
 that percentage when it is shining is 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.240
 that already charged and you can approve it to nothing 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.340
 we need more down and 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.050
 we press the button for three seconds 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.290
 so that it begins to load and we see there 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.270
 how he started loading now if this has 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.880
