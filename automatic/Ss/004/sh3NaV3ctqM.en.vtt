00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
its side
where<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.409> action<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.070> where<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> right

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
where this action here where the right

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.359 
where this action here where the right
forearm<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.810> underneath<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.860> left<00:01:53.009> forearm

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
forearm is underneath the left forearm

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.300 
forearm is underneath the left forearm
it<00:01:54.149> would<00:01:54.390> generally<00:01:55.020> mean<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> clubface

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it would generally mean the clubface

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.399 
it would generally mean the clubface
would<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.719> than<00:01:58.229> your

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would be more to the right than your

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.240 
would be more to the right than your
path<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> path<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> going<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.920> clubface

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
path so the path is going the clubface

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.459 
path so the path is going the clubface
is<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.329> left<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.810> we've<00:02:04.350> got

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
is going to the left because we've got

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.959 
is going to the left because we've got
other<00:02:04.619> issues<00:02:04.740> we've<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.189> brick<00:02:05.399> issues<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
other issues we've got brick issues of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
other issues we've got brick issues of
art<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.630> path<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.140> further<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
art and the path is going further to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.380 
art and the path is going further to
left<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.369> there's<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.640> difference<00:02:09.000> between

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
left so there's that difference between

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.020 
left so there's that difference between
the<00:02:09.629> path<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:11.280> off<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.580> left<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the path going way off to the left and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.270 
the path going way off to the left and
the<00:02:12.120> face<00:02:12.360> going

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the face going

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 
the face going
a<00:02:13.340> bit<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> left<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.140> on<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> left

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
a bit to the left so this on the left

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.990 
a bit to the left so this on the left
comes<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.160> this<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> right<00:02:16.670> hand<00:02:16.940> side

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
comes like this on the right hand side

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.260 
comes like this on the right hand side
this<00:02:17.270> image<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:17.780> what<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.200> did<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.470> made<00:02:18.680> our

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
this image here what it did it made our

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.790 
this image here what it did it made our
path<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.510> our<00:02:20.720> face<00:02:21.370> square<00:02:22.370> up<00:02:23.020> so<00:02:24.020> then<00:02:24.380> we

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
path and our face square up so then we

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
path and our face square up so then we
talked<00:02:25.040> about<00:02:25.160> changing<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.819> path<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.300> fact

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
talked about changing the path in fact

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.449 
talked about changing the path in fact
let<00:02:26.660> me<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.750> show<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.080> this<00:02:27.260> from<00:02:28.069> down<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
let me just show you this from down the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.860 
let me just show you this from down the
line<00:02:28.700> view<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.150> what<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.420> were<00:02:29.510> doing<00:02:29.750> before

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
line view of what we were doing before

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.770 
line view of what we were doing before
so<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.730> down<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.910> loop<00:02:32.090> down<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.569> line

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
so this is down the loop down the line

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.020 
so this is down the loop down the line
view<00:02:33.140> of<00:02:33.590> our<00:02:33.800> path<00:02:34.130> before<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.730> after<00:02:34.940> this

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
view of our path before and after this

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.330 
view of our path before and after this
this<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> left<00:02:35.870> before<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:37.190> can

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
this is in the left before and you can

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340 
this is in the left before and you can
see<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.580> club<00:02:37.850> shaft<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.750> way<00:02:38.840> down<00:02:39.080> here

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
see the club shaft on the way down here

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.470 
see the club shaft on the way down here
comes<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.739> little<00:02:39.830> bit<00:02:40.040> outside<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.819> little<00:02:41.390> bit

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
comes a little bit outside a little bit

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.290 
comes a little bit outside a little bit
over<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.870> top<00:02:42.400> now<00:02:43.400> we've<00:02:43.610> started<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.120> cross

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
over the top now we've started to cross

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.920 
over the top now we've started to cross
our<00:02:44.480> forearms<00:02:45.230> better<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:47.030> encouraged<00:02:47.510> Kevin

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
our forearms better we encouraged Kevin

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.470 
our forearms better we encouraged Kevin
to<00:02:48.080> swing<00:02:48.320> more<00:02:48.560> from<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.920> inside<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.730> to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
to swing more from the inside and to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.990 
to swing more from the inside and to
stop<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.170> golf<00:02:51.380> ball<00:02:51.650> going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.280> left<00:02:52.459> so

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
stop the golf ball going to the left so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.509 
stop the golf ball going to the left so
because<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> now<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.470> path<00:02:54.920> was<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
because the now the path was that the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.370 
because the now the path was that the
face<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:55.760> Square<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.450> path<00:02:56.750> because<00:02:57.350> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
face was Square to the path because the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.620 
face was Square to the path because the
forearm<00:02:57.980> release<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.700> crossover

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
forearm release and crossover

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.870 
forearm release and crossover
we've<00:03:00.350> got<00:03:00.500> Kevin<00:03:00.830> swinging<00:03:01.190> much<00:03:01.400> more<00:03:01.700> from

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
we've got Kevin swinging much more from

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.290 
we've got Kevin swinging much more from
the<00:03:01.970> inside<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:03.230> look<00:03:03.350> at<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.500> difference

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
the inside and just look at a difference

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.580 
the inside and just look at a difference
unbelievable<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:05.900> see<00:03:06.080> on<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.350> left

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
unbelievable you can see on the left

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.710 
unbelievable you can see on the left
hand<00:03:06.830> side<00:03:07.069> there<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> club<00:03:07.640> is<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.239> steep

and on the right hand side the shaft

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.400 
and on the right hand side the shaft
angle<00:03:10.910> there<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.390> pretty<00:03:11.630> much<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.319> way

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
angle there is pretty much all the way

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.900 
angle there is pretty much all the way
through<00:03:12.650> his<00:03:12.739> right<00:03:12.950> forearm<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.670> is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
through his right forearm it is

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.449 
through his right forearm it is
sensational<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.680> way<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.040> ball<00:03:16.250> would

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
sensational that way the ball would

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.940 
sensational that way the ball would
start<00:03:17.320> relatively<00:03:18.320> straight<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.769> start

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
start relatively straight and start

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.430 
start relatively straight and start
drawing<00:03:19.430> back<00:03:19.610> towards<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.840> left<00:03:21.079> hand<00:03:21.290> side

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
drawing back towards the left hand side

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.720 
drawing back towards the left hand side
or<00:03:21.620> back<00:03:21.769> towards<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.190> middle<00:03:22.280> when<00:03:22.519> he<00:03:22.610> got

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
or back towards the middle when he got

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.750 
or back towards the middle when he got
the<00:03:22.880> face<00:03:23.090> perfect<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:25.280> worked<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.640> little

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
the face perfect and we worked a little

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.160 
the face perfect and we worked a little
bit<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.180> grip<00:03:26.420> with<00:03:26.600> Kevin<00:03:26.900> as<00:03:26.989> well

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
bit on the grip with Kevin as well

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.110 
bit on the grip with Kevin as well
towards<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.620> end<00:03:27.680> because<00:03:28.190> his<00:03:28.370> grip<00:03:29.000> was

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
towards the end because his grip was

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.060 
towards the end because his grip was
just<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.390> tiny<00:03:29.750> bit<00:03:30.079> strong<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:30.650> even<00:03:30.890> when<00:03:30.980> he

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
just a tiny bit strong so even when he

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.250 
just a tiny bit strong so even when he
hit<00:03:31.280> draws<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:32.239> ball<00:03:32.450> would<00:03:32.570> start<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.930> little

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
hit draws the ball would start a little

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.710 
hit draws the ball would start a little
bit<00:03:33.380> too<00:03:33.650> straight<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.269> we'll<00:03:35.420> turn<00:03:35.660> to

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
bit too straight and then we'll turn to

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.750 
bit too straight and then we'll turn to
the<00:03:36.019> left<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.380> we<00:03:36.470> improved<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.400> grip<00:03:37.640> we

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
the left so we improved the the grip we

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.030 
the left so we improved the the grip we
neutralized<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.540> up<00:03:38.630> making<00:03:39.620> sure<00:03:39.769> you<00:03:39.950> could

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
neutralized it up making sure you could

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.680 
neutralized it up making sure you could
only<00:03:40.190> see<00:03:40.459> two<00:03:40.730> knuckles<00:03:41.090> on<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.299> back<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.600> his

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
he did change the path it suited the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.259 
he did change the path it suited the
downswing<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.040> he<00:03:49.100> could<00:03:49.280> hit<00:03:49.400> these<00:03:49.579> lovely
