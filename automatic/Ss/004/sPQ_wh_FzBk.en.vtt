00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.150
 teach how to make alioli oil as 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.879
 we say here in valencia well let's 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 need two or three cloves of garlic a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.260
 egg at room temperature 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.940
 sunflower oil a pinch of salt a 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.930
 bowl and blender 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:33.570
 ok let's start by putting the garlic to 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 small pieces of maria and in the bowl 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.100
 now let's put the egg 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.850
 if it is not at room temperature we will 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.930
 set the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.930
 the tea water 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.630
 now we give you a spark salt tub 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.399
 and now we will throw like a glass of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.399
 Sunflower oil is thrown all together 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.640
 and now let's put the blender 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.910
 and we're not going to lift it until it's 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.730
 The value is in leaving it 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.260
 still and when it rises it is curdled 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.620
 then you start to move the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.620
 mixer 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.650
 and it was already beginning to set and now 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.620
 we want more quantity because we can go 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.500
 throwing the trickle as you see here I have 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.490
 more hands are coming out will shape 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490
 needing 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:42.350
 and good we go 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.240
 beating and as you can see it is very easy 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.730
 adding so that more is done and that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.300
 make more garlic oil and until 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.380
 we need you can make up one kilo 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.140
 If you want 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.830
 and now we turn off the mixer and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.830
 enjoy it 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.400
 because it is the best with a teaspoon 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.970

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.000
