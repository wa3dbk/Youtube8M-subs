00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 children are born as rats 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.840
 children are generated as rats 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 are placed in the world as rats and not 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 come with this story that was 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 God that gave me God gave the proof. 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:25.310
 God, no, no, no, no, no, we are. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.310
 that we make kids or it 's not personal 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.219
 then this story that the son came 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.920
 of mother came from pv comes from god that god 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 God gave me strengths and conditions for you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.930
 plant and harvest 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.940
 then you planted the seed on the woman 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.550
 so will you beget a son? 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 And how many times do you do this? 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.649
 generate children 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:03.090
 sometimes these children generate other children 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:09.860
 and these children are being generated without 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.850
 father without mother sometimes without father without mother 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:19.310
 are played in the world suffer the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 consequences of social injustice 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:28.040
 What's up, God? 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 Then God gave us one where they are in us. 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.009
 enabled him he gives us conditions it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.759
 we were not but we have to use 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.350
 these hands to work and give us 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 legs so that we can 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 and we moved from intelligence to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.590
 people can use it but it is not 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.720
 responsible for our maladies 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.049
 our ills astral who are we 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.009
 same when we listen when 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:06.600
 we hear a gentleman who is not the master 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.250
 jesus takes his problems his 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.530
 our problems 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 they were arranged by ourselves 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.970
 Of course the devil uses he inspires him 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.450
 also it will avoid that one 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:32.670
 kick but still who 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:37.130
 decide who determines us 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 we chose that we chose here
