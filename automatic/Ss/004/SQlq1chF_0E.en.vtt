00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
talking about self generating walls and

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.450 
talking about self generating walls and
self<00:00:08.280> building<00:00:08.880> walls<00:00:09.769> idea<00:00:10.769> came<00:00:11.429> from

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
self building walls idea came from

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.120 
self building walls idea came from
sethbling<00:00:12.450> channel<00:00:14.120> he<00:00:15.120> did<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> video<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:16.130> self

sethbling channel he did a video on self

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.640 
sethbling channel he did a video on self
building<00:00:17.580> walls<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.119> since<00:00:18.600> i<00:00:18.750> play<00:00:18.990> factions

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
building walls and since i play factions

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.390 
building walls and since i play factions
and<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:22.100> faction<00:00:23.100> based<00:00:24.980> videos<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and I have a faction based videos I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.900 
and I have a faction based videos I
decided<00:00:27.380> hey<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> could<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> idea<00:00:29.640> for

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
decided hey I could use this idea for

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
decided hey I could use this idea for
factions<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.840> then<00:00:31.080> spread<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> throughout

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
factions and then spread it throughout

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400 
factions and then spread it throughout
the<00:00:32.130> faction<00:00:32.610> community<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.780> help<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.230> guys

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the faction community to help you guys

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
the faction community to help you guys
build<00:00:34.800> your<00:00:35.040> base<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.760> faster<00:00:36.180> so

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
build your base a little bit faster so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.299 
build your base a little bit faster so
let's<00:00:38.030> check<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.960> works

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
let's check it out see how it works

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
let's check it out see how it works
basically<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:42.690> dispenses<00:00:43.379> lava<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.329> then<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
basically it dispenses lava and then it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.380 
basically it dispenses lava and then it
dispenses<00:00:46.079> lava<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> mean<00:00:47.160> water<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
dispenses lava or I mean water on top of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.189 
dispenses lava or I mean water on top of
the<00:00:48.480> lava<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.680> creates<00:00:50.039> cobble<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.199> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the lava and it creates cobble and so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.270 
the lava and it creates cobble and so
basically<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> self<00:00:53.579> building<00:00:54.120> base

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
basically you have a self building base

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.670 
basically you have a self building base
and<00:00:58.190> throughout<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> faction<00:00:59.789> community

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
and throughout the faction community

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.709 
and throughout the faction community
people<00:01:01.680> spend<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.340> lot<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> time<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.449> their

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
people spend a lot of time on their

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.850 
people spend a lot of time on their
walls<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.070> thinking<00:01:05.460> man<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> can

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
walls so I was thinking man you can

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.570 
walls so I was thinking man you can
seriously<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:09.560> really<00:01:10.560> fast<00:01:10.860> instead<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
seriously do this really fast instead of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.910 
seriously do this really fast instead of
hours<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.270> hours<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.750> hours<00:01:13.200> place<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
hours and hours and hours place and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
hours and hours and hours place and
block<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.340> block<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:17.000> get<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.270> dispensers

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
block by block you get some dispensers

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.399 
block by block you get some dispensers
hook<00:01:19.290> them<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> redstone<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.259> let<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
hook them up to redstone and let it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.149 
hook them up to redstone and let it
build<00:01:22.590> itself<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.950> go<00:01:26.130> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
build itself really so there you go you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.749 
build itself really so there you go you
have<00:01:26.400> your<00:01:26.880> own<00:01:27.299> base<00:01:27.689> already<00:01:28.320> built<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
have your own base already built all you

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.539 
have your own base already built all you
need<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.119> dispensers<00:01:30.869> lava<00:01:31.549> redstone

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
need is dispensers lava redstone

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.310 
need is dispensers lava redstone
repeaters<00:01:34.250> in<00:01:35.250> actuality<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.420> only<00:01:36.900> need

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
repeaters in actuality you only need

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.190 
repeaters in actuality you only need
buckets<00:01:37.829> lava<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.090> water<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:39.960> really

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
buckets lava and water you don't really

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.359 
buckets lava and water you don't really
need<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.710> automatic<00:01:41.549> dispensing<00:01:42.210> part<00:01:43.369> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
need the automatic dispensing part so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
need the automatic dispensing part so
there<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:44.970> you've<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.950> your<00:01:46.950> base

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there you go you've got your base

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.230 
there you go you've got your base
already<00:01:48.119> built<00:01:49.040> TNT<00:01:50.040> proof<00:01:50.369> it's<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.790> hybrid

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
already built TNT proof it's not hybrid

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.080 
already built TNT proof it's not hybrid
Cana<00:01:51.689> proof<00:01:52.079> yet<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.909> idea<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
Cana proof yet so my idea is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.679 
Cana proof yet so my idea is
to<00:01:56.020> do<00:01:56.259> this<00:01:56.619> multiple<00:01:57.369> times<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.229> you'll<00:01:59.560> have

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
to do this multiple times so you'll have

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.630 
to do this multiple times so you'll have
spaces<00:02:01.689> in<00:02:01.929> between<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.560> blocks<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.219> did

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
spaces in between the blocks if you did

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.090 
spaces in between the blocks if you did
this<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.840> pattern<00:02:05.049> goes<00:02:05.469> like<00:02:05.679> this<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.069> goes

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
this the pattern goes like this it goes

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.910 
this the pattern goes like this it goes
to<00:02:06.869> 1<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:10.200> 1<00:02:11.200> or<00:02:11.470> 1<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.069> 2<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:14.319> if<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.680> did

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
to 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 and then if you did

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.020 
to 1 to 1 or 1 to 2 and then if you did
this<00:02:15.069> multiple<00:02:15.670> times<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:17.160> could<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:18.580> your

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
this multiple times you could have your

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.479 
this multiple times you could have your
water<00:02:19.330> layer<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.049> then<00:02:20.440> your<00:02:20.650> lava<00:02:20.830> layer<00:02:21.129> so

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
water layer and then your lava layer so

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.860 
water layer and then your lava layer so
I<00:02:21.519> did<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.910> 3<00:02:22.360> times<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.760> outer<00:02:25.390> wall

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
I did this 3 times so this outer wall

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.339 
I did this 3 times so this outer wall
would<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:27.250> right<00:02:27.519> here<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.000> then<00:02:28.630> you

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
would be this right here and then you

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
would be this right here and then you
placed<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.860> dispensers<00:02:30.519> two<00:02:30.880> blocks<00:02:31.180> behind

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
placed your dispensers two blocks behind

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.190 
placed your dispensers two blocks behind
it<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.079> then<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:34.000> would<00:02:34.209> be<00:02:34.360> air<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:34.989> then

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
it and then that would be air and then

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.870 
it and then that would be air and then
you<00:02:35.530> would<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.920> come<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.489> put<00:02:36.700> water

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you would have to come in and put water

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.789 
you would have to come in and put water
in<00:02:37.329> between<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.360> a

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
in between it and this is a

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.910 
in between it and this is a
self-generating<00:02:41.799> wall<00:02:42.010> meaning<00:02:42.910> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
self-generating wall meaning it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.080 
self-generating wall meaning it's
totally<00:02:44.920> TNT<00:02:45.519> proof<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:47.549> cannon<00:02:48.549> proof<00:02:48.790> or

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
totally TNT proof and cannon proof or

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.979 
totally TNT proof and cannon proof or
sand<00:02:49.840> cannon<00:02:50.260> for<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.620> hybrid<00:02:50.829> cannon<00:02:51.430> proof

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
sand cannon for a hybrid cannon proof

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.009 
sand cannon for a hybrid cannon proof
meaning<00:02:53.190> if<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.370> gets<00:02:54.549> hit<00:02:54.790> by<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> sand<00:02:55.540> cannon

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
meaning if it gets hit by a sand cannon

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.470 
meaning if it gets hit by a sand cannon
it<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.440> auto<00:02:56.739> regenerate<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.329> is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
it will auto regenerate so this is

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.470 
it will auto regenerate so this is
actually<00:02:59.170> very<00:02:59.200> amazing<00:02:59.980> if<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.880> really

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
actually very amazing if you really

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.979 
actually very amazing if you really
wanted<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.859> know<00:03:02.910> unreadable<00:03:03.910> base<00:03:04.420> so

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
wanted to you know unreadable base so

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.699 
wanted to you know unreadable base so
they<00:03:05.170> say<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:07.239> that's<00:03:07.389> that's<00:03:07.840> my<00:03:08.109> take<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.650> it

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
they say so that's that's my take on it

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.150 
they say so that's that's my take on it
it<00:03:09.010> takes<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:10.019> lot<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.049> effort<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.650> get<00:03:11.950> all

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
it takes a lot of effort to get all

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it takes a lot of effort to get all
these<00:03:12.370> lava<00:03:12.880> buckets<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.760> spend

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
these lava buckets but if you spend

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.270 
these lava buckets but if you spend
hours<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.750> hours<00:03:16.870> playing<00:03:17.290> factions<00:03:17.889> it

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
hours and hours playing factions it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.809 
hours and hours playing factions it
might<00:03:18.819> be<00:03:19.000> worth<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.790> just

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
might be worth it and then this is just

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.830 
might be worth it and then this is just
example<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.980> auto<00:03:24.549> regenerating<00:03:25.389> wall

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.440 

so<00:03:29.840> this<00:03:30.020> could<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:30.830> right<00:03:31.100> now<00:03:31.400> hit<00:03:32.150> stop

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
so this could this right now hit stop

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.860 
so this could this right now hit stop
hybrid<00:03:33.230> cannons<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:33.950> regular<00:03:34.910> TNT<00:03:35.450> Candace

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
hybrid cannons and regular TNT Candace

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.450 
hybrid cannons and regular TNT Candace
so<00:03:36.440> I'll<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:36.710> demonstrate<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.490> you<00:03:37.580> put

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
so I'll just demonstrate it you put

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.350 
so I'll just demonstrate it you put
saying<00:03:40.460> on<00:03:40.730> top<00:03:40.970> of<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.300> TNT<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:43.360> sand

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
saying on top of the TNT so the sand

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
saying on top of the TNT so the sand
blocks<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.990> water<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.590> TNT<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.190> can

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
blocks the water to the TNT you can

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.660 
blocks the water to the TNT you can
ignite<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.630> bam<00:03:50.990> it<00:03:51.200> blows<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:51.800> and<00:03:51.950> then<00:03:52.370> Auto

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
ignite and bam it blows up and then Auto

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.750 
ignite and bam it blows up and then Auto
regenerates<00:03:53.330> so<00:03:54.110> there's<00:03:54.290> actually<00:03:54.590> no<00:03:55.220> way

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
regenerates so there's actually no way

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.930 
regenerates so there's actually no way
people<00:03:56.350> can<00:03:57.350> get<00:03:57.740> through<00:03:58.010> these<00:03:58.130> walls<00:03:58.459> if

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
people can get through these walls if

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.170 
people can get through these walls if
you<00:03:59.270> had<00:03:59.450> them<00:03:59.570> set<00:04:00.140> up<00:04:00.320> correctly<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.940> hope

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
you had them set up correctly so I hope

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.350 
you had them set up correctly so I hope
you<00:04:02.300> guys<00:04:02.450> enjoyed<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.050> video<00:04:03.170> leave<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:03.980> like

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
lot of factions myself just trying to

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.350 
lot of factions myself just trying to
get<00:04:12.920> some<00:04:13.160> ideas<00:04:13.340> out<00:04:13.760> there<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:14.239> make

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
get some ideas out there to make

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.319 
get some ideas out there to make
factions<00:04:14.930> even<00:04:15.650> even<00:04:16.640> more<00:04:16.790> fun<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:19.329> thanks

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329
