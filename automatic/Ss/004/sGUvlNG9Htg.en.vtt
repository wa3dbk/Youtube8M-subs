00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that black which I like I think it looks

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.820 
that black which I like I think it looks
nice<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.140> adidas<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> whole<00:01:19.470> thing<00:01:19.650> saying

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
nice and adidas has a whole thing saying

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.140 
nice and adidas has a whole thing saying
the<00:01:19.890> boost<00:01:20.159> foam<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.520> only<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> white

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the boost foam can only be in a white

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.870 
the boost foam can only be in a white
which<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> total<00:01:22.920> total<00:01:23.159> lie<00:01:23.520> on

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
which i think is a total total lie on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
which i think is a total total lie on
they've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.630> they've<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.200> if

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
they've got to be they've got to be if

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
they've got to be they've got to be if
not<00:01:25.650> already<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.220> developed<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> make

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
not already have developed a way to make

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
not already have developed a way to make
it<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.290> different<00:01:28.439> color<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.340> if

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it a different color I don't know if

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
it a different color I don't know if
maybe<00:01:30.500> how<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.530> make<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.070> put

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
maybe how they make it if they put

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.679 
maybe how they make it if they put
another<00:01:32.579> coating<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.060> color<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
another coating of color over if it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
another coating of color over if it
would<00:01:33.780> change<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> boost<00:01:35.159> does

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
would change the way that the boost does

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480 
would change the way that the boost does
or<00:01:35.610> something<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.210> no<00:01:36.390> idea<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.340> then

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
or something I have no idea and then

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.740 
or something I have no idea and then
she'll<00:01:38.700> area<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.329> I've<00:01:39.420> seen<00:01:39.600> pictures

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
she'll area when I've seen pictures

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.179 
she'll area when I've seen pictures
online<00:01:40.049> I've<00:01:40.350> always<00:01:40.560> thought<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> little

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
online I've always thought it's a little

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
online I've always thought it's a little
weird<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.729> didn't<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
weird I didn't know what it was like but

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.060 
weird I didn't know what it was like but
it's<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:45.470> not<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> fleece

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it's kind of like a not really a fleece

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.149 
it's kind of like a not really a fleece
but<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.990> weird<00:01:48.990> hairy<00:01:49.439> material<00:01:50.130> I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
but just like a weird hairy material I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
but just like a weird hairy material I
can't<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> name<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
guess you could say fleece catches a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.719 
guess you could say fleece catches a
little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> dirt<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.890> easily<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.610> it's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
little bit of dirt there easily but it's

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389

these<00:02:10.319> are<00:02:10.440> 120<00:02:10.860> retail<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.840> not<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> super

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
these are 120 retail so it's not a super

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
these are 120 retail so it's not a super
low<00:02:13.470> price

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
low price

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.140

like<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> Roshi<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.670> been<00:02:14.760> compared

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
like the Roshi these have been compared

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.220 
like the Roshi these have been compared
to<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.330> Roshi<00:02:15.510> which<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.810> don't<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.200> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to the Roshi which I don't think is a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.560 
to the Roshi which I don't think is a
very<00:02:16.560> fair<00:02:16.860> comparison<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.240> might<00:02:18.480> be

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
very fair comparison but I might be

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140 
very fair comparison but I might be
making<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> pair<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.140> sin<00:02:19.850> comparison<00:02:20.850> anyway

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
making a pair of sin comparison anyway

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.870 
making a pair of sin comparison anyway
with<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.080> ZX<00:02:22.410> flux<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> Roshi<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.520> maybe

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
with the ZX flux and the Roshi and maybe

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.630 
with the ZX flux and the Roshi and maybe
even<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> free<00:02:24.330> run<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:25.980> due<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.340> nature

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
even the free run see due to the nature

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.700 
even the free run see due to the nature
the<00:02:26.700> material<00:02:27.030> used<00:02:27.300> some<00:02:27.810> color<00:02:28.110> migration

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the material used some color migration

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.150 
the material used some color migration
may<00:02:28.830> occur<00:02:29.070> during<00:02:29.280> we're<00:02:30.410> not<00:02:31.410> exactly<00:02:31.950> sure

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
may occur during we're not exactly sure

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.320 
may occur during we're not exactly sure
that<00:02:32.190> means<00:02:32.460> I'm<00:02:32.550> guess<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:32.880> pertaining

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that means I'm guess that's pertaining

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.860 
that means I'm guess that's pertaining
to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.990> city<00:02:34.680> blur<00:02:34.920> upper<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.600> guess<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.750> haven't

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
to the city blur upper I guess I haven't

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.450 
to the city blur upper I guess I haven't
really<00:02:37.380> seen<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.040> guess<00:02:38.280> that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
really seen that so I guess that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.550 
really seen that so I guess that
pertains<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.270> um<00:02:40.250> I'm<00:02:41.250> guessing<00:02:41.610> yeah<00:02:42.560> so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
pertains to this um I'm guessing yeah so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560 
pertains to this um I'm guessing yeah so

opinion<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.050> would<00:03:25.080> say<00:03:25.380> go<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:25.740> half<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.190> size

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
opinion I would say go up half a size

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
and these but of course if you can try

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.120 
and these but of course if you can try
them<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.459> always<00:03:29.760> works<00:03:32.060> well<00:03:33.860> very<00:03:34.860> nice

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130

them on that always works well very nice
feeling

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670

real nice husband see a hot and laced up
just<00:03:48.690> tied<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.050> regularly<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.800> think<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.340> is

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
just tied up regularly I think this is

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.620 
just tied up regularly I think this is
the<00:03:50.580> only<00:03:50.760> way<00:03:50.910> I'm<00:03:50.970> gonna<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.120> wearing<00:03:51.330> them<00:03:51.540> I

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
the only way I'm gonna be wearing them I

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.720 
the only way I'm gonna be wearing them I
don't<00:03:51.690> see<00:03:51.900> myself<00:03:52.050> wearing<00:03:52.530> them<00:03:52.650> any<00:03:53.610> other

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
don't see myself wearing them any other

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.330 
don't see myself wearing them any other
way<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:57.300> think<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.540> feels<00:03:57.750> real<00:03:57.959> nice<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
way I just think it feels real nice the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.310 
way I just think it feels real nice the
concentration<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> boost<00:04:00.420> for<00:04:00.900> obvious

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
concentration of the boost for obvious

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.040 
concentration of the boost for obvious
reasons<00:04:01.650> as<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.860> can<00:04:02.010> see<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.490> more<00:04:03.360> in<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
reasons as you can see is more in the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.310 
reasons as you can see is more in the
heel<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.180> then<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.300> course<00:04:06.330> I<00:04:06.540> have<00:04:06.660> offset<00:04:07.080> in

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
heel and then of course I have offset in

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.640 
heel and then of course I have offset in
the<00:04:07.920> forefoot<00:04:08.430> which<00:04:09.320> really<00:04:10.320> like<00:04:10.470> any

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
the forefoot which really like any

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.350 
the forefoot which really like any
running<00:04:11.100> shoot<00:04:11.370> that's<00:04:11.700> usually<00:04:12.180> what<00:04:12.270> you

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
running shoot that's usually what you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.440 
running shoot that's usually what you
see<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.660> see<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.989> heel<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> little<00:04:13.650> higher<00:04:14.450> but

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
see you see the heel a little higher but

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.880 
see you see the heel a little higher but
I<00:04:15.480> won't<00:04:15.840> obviously<00:04:16.260> be<00:04:16.350> using<00:04:16.590> these<00:04:16.680> for
