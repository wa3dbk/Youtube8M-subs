00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.870
 from the left side to what are our 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.190

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.320

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.899
 let's dial this contact 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.629

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.790
 what is a computer with android we are going to 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.970
 enter the tab in which the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.530
 name of the contact and throw a click 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 after that we will appear a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.390
 screen where are the options of 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.190
 send messages free calls and 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.180

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.400
 here you have just started a call 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.470
 free for facebook 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.150
 here we are seeing how the sony team 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 with android is receiving 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.700
 without any problem 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.860
 this is a new way 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.140
 of facebook to make calls 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.420
 free normally we all have 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.789
 facebook on our devices now 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.789
 let's make from the other iphone 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.580
 to the first team 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 let's go back to the contact tab 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 and we will apply for free call 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 and we will answer 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.550
 these types of calls do not have any 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.660
 kind of time limit always and 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 when you have connection either 3g or wi-fi 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 the call has an excellent signal 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.020
 let's say you can substitute very 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.750
 easily to the wta and see 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.780
 without asking anything we will cancel the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.780
 call 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 and we're also going to check that we can 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.390
 close our bubbles 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.610
 and deactivate the calls good friends 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.850
 is this type of application serves to 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:48.040
 any android equipment with them 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.730
 grapo to make free calls 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.730
