these are the tools you're going to need
to<00:00:08.599> regular<00:00:09.599> pushpins<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:10.860> you're<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
to regular pushpins now you're going to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.120 
to regular pushpins now you're going to
take<00:00:11.670> your<00:00:11.910> chain<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.630> you're<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> just

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
take your chain and you're going to just

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300 
take your chain and you're going to just
put<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> pins<00:00:15.809> randomly<00:00:16.740> into<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
put one of the pins randomly into the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.640 
put one of the pins randomly into the
center<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.150> mess<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> take

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
center of the mess you're going to take

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.010 
center of the mess you're going to take
the<00:00:19.830> other<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.699> you're<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> tease

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the other one and you're going to tease

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.820 
the other one and you're going to tease
away<00:00:23.570> pick<00:00:24.570> another<00:00:24.779> spot<00:00:25.050> you're<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.650> going

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
away pick another spot you're just going

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.400 
away pick another spot you're just going
to<00:00:25.859> tease<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> apart<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.900> you're<00:00:28.109> teasing

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
to tease it apart and as you're teasing

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.389 
to tease it apart and as you're teasing
it<00:00:28.680> apart<00:00:29.039> you're<00:00:29.760> creating<00:00:30.330> openings<00:00:31.399> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it apart you're creating openings so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.889 
it apart you're creating openings so
that<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.660> complete<00:00:34.730> total<00:00:35.730> mess

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that it's not just a complete total mess

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
that it's not just a complete total mess
so<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:38.100> actually<00:00:38.309> probably<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so this actually probably is going to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.319 
so this actually probably is going to
take<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> while<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:42.059> not

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
take a while and I actually do not

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
take a while and I actually do not
recommend<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.649> desk<00:00:43.980> as

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
recommend that you do it on your desk as

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.600 
recommend that you do it on your desk as
you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:46.250> scratching<00:00:47.250> my

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you can see I'm kind of scratching my

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
you can see I'm kind of scratching my
little<00:00:47.879> leather<00:00:48.090> cover<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> look

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
little leather cover but if you look

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.979 
little leather cover but if you look
closely<00:00:50.129> you'll<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.550> that's<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> first

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
closely you'll see that's not the first

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.860 
closely you'll see that's not the first
time<00:00:52.289> once<00:00:53.250> you've<00:00:53.489> teased<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.149> apart<00:00:54.510> quite<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
time once you've teased it apart quite a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.240 
time once you've teased it apart quite a
bit<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:57.360> least<00:00:57.750> two<00:00:58.469> chains

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
bit this is actually at least two chains

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
bit this is actually at least two chains
I<00:00:59.670> picked<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.480> client<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.109> this

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I picked it up for my client like this

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
I picked it up for my client like this
and<00:01:01.559> she's<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.739> please<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.820> untangle

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and she's like please can you untangle

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280 
and she's like please can you untangle
this<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.580> good<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> store<00:01:06.270> your<00:01:06.330> chains<00:01:06.869> so

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
this a good way to store your chains so

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
this a good way to store your chains so
they<00:01:07.380> don't<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they don't get like this is to put the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830 
they don't get like this is to put the
clasp<00:01:10.110> together<00:01:10.909> one<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> biggest<00:01:12.540> causes

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
clasp together one of the biggest causes

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.580 
clasp together one of the biggest causes
of<00:01:13.380> tangling<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.520> leave<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.000> clasp

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
of tangling is to leave the clasp

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.969 
of tangling is to leave the clasp
separate<00:01:16.700> from<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> chain<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
separate from the chain and then it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.240 
separate from the chain and then it
allows<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:21.780> different<00:01:22.170> chains<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.920> get

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
allows the two different chains to get

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
allows the two different chains to get
tangled<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.820> each<00:01:24.000> other<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.840> even<00:01:25.200> allows<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
tangled with each other it even allows a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.600 
tangled with each other it even allows a
chain<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> tangle<00:01:27.060> with<00:01:27.240> itself<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.340> if<00:01:29.340> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
chain to tangle with itself so if you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.539 
chain to tangle with itself so if you
store<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.530> quite<00:01:31.530> separately<00:01:32.100> at<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
store them quite separately at this

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.090 
store them quite separately at this
point<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> pick<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.140> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
point I'm going to pick this up and just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.179 
point I'm going to pick this up and just
manually<00:01:35.850> try<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> ha<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:37.829> these<00:01:37.979> are

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
manually try to ha you see how these are

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
manually try to ha you see how these are
together<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:40.009> for

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
together with it like this for

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.480 
together with it like this for
untangling<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> undo<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
untangling you want to undo all the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.130 
untangling you want to undo all the
clasps<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.140> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
clasps so now when I get in here I just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.300 
clasps so now when I get in here I just
pulled<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.950> clasp<00:01:50.939> apart<00:01:51.659> or<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.110> end<00:01:52.350> part

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
pulled that clasp apart or that end part

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.200 
pulled that clasp apart or that end part
away<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.470> knot<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.800> now<00:01:56.510> less<00:01:58.370> huge<00:01:59.370> than

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
away so the knot is now less huge than

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
away so the knot is now less huge than
it<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.540> before<00:02:01.130> they<00:02:02.130> were<00:02:02.430> making<00:02:02.610> progress

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it was before they were making progress

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.430 
it was before they were making progress
here<00:02:03.950> when<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> travel<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.700> chains<00:02:06.440> it's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
here when you travel with chains it's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.949 
here when you travel with chains it's
really<00:02:07.920> good<00:02:08.220> never<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.179> put<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.630> chains

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
really good never to put your chains

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.590 
really good never to put your chains
together<00:02:10.640> even<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.880> have<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> pretty

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
together even if you have a pretty

together even if you have a pretty
little<00:02:12.750> pouch<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.709> looks<00:02:13.920> all<00:02:14.070> organized
