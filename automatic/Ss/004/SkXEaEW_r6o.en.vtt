 Hello and welcome to another small rooms 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.219
 Year tutorial from me because I was asked namely in the Comments percent 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.230
 to clarify the age terms 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.020
 yes that is possible I have there also the link of Andy 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.550
 Description posted Grossmann Video 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.669
 Pamphlet and masts 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.060
 but I should all that too normal 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.749
 self explain and percent 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.519
 even though here is the explanation in English if I have the whole thing now 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.410
 nor my German and Turks so Amann 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 So click here Sinclair Comments 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.330
 that's percent 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.790
 probably important for well finished 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.820
 that's also here as a comic pack for download 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 and those are officially in my account - will 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.090
 Zinnecker Comments 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.929
 go 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.030
 quite far to the end of the first post 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 and get here the choice for each different versions 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.020
 to download 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.909
 we decide for the newest version times very difficult from 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 and so Landers down 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.340
 preferably, of course, perhaps the one who died in May and go 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.900
 he achieved by, for example, the Bundesligen 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 below with this client but fine Zeiler 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.200
 that was in percent signs 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.750
 and partners 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.150
 give presents 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.640
 And of course a visit warns out that was not planned and yet 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 times 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.730
 dapd AFP 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.950
 are with it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.420
 and here come straight to Baghdad Romain week the man dies 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.010
 So you ended up here interpreted on Rome and my Kreft 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:46.990
 choose 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.030
 that's all we're doing there and already the scene player here 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.480
 Comments as show packs 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.390
 so we go on as with every other murder in their mind Clair 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 want to use 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.760
 by going off 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.570
 in the folder the Mike Ritscher 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.570
 with a pact program open preferably WinRAR 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:08.790
 so 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.370
 Now we get a list of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.249
 Ortenau and classes 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.919
 in my power stands Klier typical Niemetal vaccination program 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.009
 this is very important 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.769
 without that no murder and percent works 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 after deleting condition this is important 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.519
 that we now 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.289
 Heyne 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:32.339
 this 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.229
 Folder here 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.209
 all classes are pure 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 A copy of July does not necessarily have to be 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 and that will be completely confirmed 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.099
 he wanted to be yes 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.899
 they could not do this 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.459
 a in this file but 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.739
 become the godparents 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 the in-or 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.999
 and now 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.039
 Let's start 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.039
 So learn again here Kruse 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.259
 does not always pull 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.259
 Woerth is 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 and I'm curious what comes out of it 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.879
 finally finished 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 very nice 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.209
 OK 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.439
 the first can now call with the chat or whatever projects 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.569
 has the chat and around 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.409
 that would have for example / st 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.409
 Criteria also one 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.410
 arming 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.529
 consist of many 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.189
 most commands that work here 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.229
 that's all percent of Modick he also gave as already presented 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.659
 she could do it with 31 for example 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.549
 and pull Peacocks fetch 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.849
 and J 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.849
 then you enter again directly Rosh but so far track 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:10.889
 to 4 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.959
 Norman always beautiful 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.919
 7 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.799
 Radios 5 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.639
 important is 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.249
 that would be even the range set that is otherwise percent 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.669
 just stop it I do not know what limited but you can not do that 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.059
 working far into the distance 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.360
 but buildings with stones and I do not know 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.340
 UN dat hunn datt 50m luxury 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.710
 quite relaxed 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.900
 So I could arise 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.939
 after a right click for example 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.229
 we come here now 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.249
 the Porsche 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:47.740
 Tel Aviv 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.219
 so no problem 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.219
 probably the left scene player 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 as available as in the multiplex 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.560
 So I cook I hope I could help you specifically Dior Maik Rathje and the 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.309
 I hope we see you soon again and have fun until then
