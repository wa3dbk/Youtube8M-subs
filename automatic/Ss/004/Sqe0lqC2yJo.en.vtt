00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.140
 personal speech of youtube beauty here is the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.810
 marlon from the ex gamer channel bringing 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.580
 You more of a video galera in the video of 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.970
 today we will have various information 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 about future updates of gta 5 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.680
 both in the story mode and in the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.450
 online mode mainly based on 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.460
 some codes that are within the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.950
 game and not only this but also another 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.860
 information on the return of the sea 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.320
 gt history mode dlc a 5 but with 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.580
 said it has already left down here and we'll 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.110
 there for information 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 I have some printscreens as well 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.250
 about these codes that 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.810
 are there in the pc version is much more 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.030
 easy access to these codes 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.220
 including all politicians you go 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.170
 see these directories where these are 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.210
 files even if you have installed 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 You can all wet yourself but 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.140
 How do I view our first code? 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.659
 mysterious strange suspect who has 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.340
 within gta 5 is one that mentions the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.220
 a how do I see the name of the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.970
 archive is andré nienaber da ny yankees 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.530
 unb andré 0 1 point and d 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.030
 there is one that has another format that 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.830
 are yf tym try.it of actually these 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.960
 formats here they are 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.670
 texture file formats of the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.650
 three-dimensional models that are 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.680
 inside the game and pilon of 10 means 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.560
 add draws and ypf means 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.470
 fragmented object and mt means 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.400
 meta-data yt of dictionary 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.750
 textures 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.430
 so for those who understand programming 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 must have understood that I say that they are 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 simply file formats of 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.210
 texture within the game and they are all 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.280
 for such a zombie as you see 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
 are all very small files and the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.630
 gta edith site he says that these 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.490
 Texture file formats they 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 can be edited as the tool 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.140
 developed by module called ceiling 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.180
 This kit is only possible because 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 rockstar as gta open source action 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 allowing the molds to be 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.920
 made 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.319
 this is how 3d modeling molds and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.269
 textures are made for equal play 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.280
 to the molds of super heroes you saw 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.530
 that in the last video of modding saints 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.260
 for example among other things and as 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.690
 you should already know 5 gt to 5 already have one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.760
 ivanilde blue bikini but the ones 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.620
 modules 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.739
 with that code which is not 21 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 bollywood and cindy another 3d modeling of 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.790
 some a bi that has not yet been placed 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.920
 in the game because pieces of the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.549
 codes and going in the future to the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 game 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.120
 very likely in one of them and in the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.379
 history or maybe even one of them and 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.209
 online mode 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.890
 not only this but also has that second 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.629
 why you are seeing with there 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.360
 three files are there seeing that he 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.349
 calls dlc andrés apparently or 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 be flat 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.129
 anders krohn something else in case 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.420
 have called wizard harry 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.120
 in case you do not know wizard harry 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.549
 means brushing your hair 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.989
 The second one is brush which means in 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.420
 English brushing teeth 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.280
 and the third is the star made which means 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.250
 wash your face, how are you? 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.470
 their format is point to wc 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.659
 for those who do not know the toilet is a 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.150
 audio file to use 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.159
 less space and w means 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.810
 one of the sonorous 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.629
 basically the following are files from 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.190
 sounds and sound effects within game 1 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.620
 is the sound effect of brushing the hair 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.720
 others brush their teeth and the third of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.000
 wash your face or possibly 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.160
 some sound effects that could come 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.230
 project online after all the name 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.090
 of file is theirs and angers cut 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.949
 apparently is something that 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.579
 should come to the gta apartments 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.560
 online 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.090
 maybe an update will come in the future 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.709
 some option for us to brush the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 hair brush teeth face wash 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.639
 in the bathroom including how you already know 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.410
 Is not how you shower in the bathroom? 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.239
 the maine hotel which is a thing that in the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.099
 actually has a utility or serve to 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.299
 you clean your character when he 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.099
 It's full of blood, for example, if you 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.150
 It's an apartment and take a shower. 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.680
 everything will be clean 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.959
 only those options here to fix the 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.849
 hair brushing your teeth wash your face 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.590
 does not have much function but still 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.599
 could be something that resembles some 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.280
 future should be gt online so still 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.049
 so it 's very interesting to see that this is 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.209
 within the game that these sound effects 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.579
 are inside the game still have the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.250
 third in which it is called reg 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.500
 andraus court type anders krohn force 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.659
 point x ml for those who do not know this 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.449
 xml file is a language of 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:27.310
 html-like programming that can 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.409
 be edited by text is that they contain 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.120
 codes and rules that can be 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.760
 being read for humans as well as for 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.900
 by machines as the game itself is 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.449
 a machine 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.580
 cml means who knows the middle field 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.860
 light where and how you know horse 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.360
 English means horse and it's one thing 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.039
 that we wait a long time 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.229
 could be an animal that could come 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.360
 pro game mainly in dlc casinos 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.250
 and could open that jockey club that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.169
 behind the casino with 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.270
 bet of horses and everything else then 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.190
 really the schedule for horses 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.259
 It's really in the game guys, what's good? 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.120
 I suspect why hawks is putting this 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.070
 lots of things are things that would not go 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.020
 come to the game as I said adele and do 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.759
 way history could be one of them and 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.590
 for each of the characters, ie a 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.960
 delicious I put clothes on by michael and one 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.550
 by franklin and even the clover would 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.889
 get closer to an assault within 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.630
 of the casino would basically be a 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.850
 of the stories that would tell in 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.979
 this delight from trevor and could very 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.050
 well worth points in this dlc 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.090
 see also after everything else or else 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.250
 perhaps I would also be designed online 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.470
 interesting as they are seeing the name of the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.810
 file r doll for those who do not know the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.970
 guidom means test doll 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.919
 basically and is the name of physics 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.169
 that is applied to the bodies of the 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.479
 characters and also of the cnp ses when 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.949
 for example you fall from a high place or 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.810
 when they are hit by a car and 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.970
 he turns that doll that makes an effect 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.750
 realistically resembling the physics of 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.310
 real world 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.139
 so how did you see there were three 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.970
 print screens with some files as well 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.770
 suspects inside the game both talking 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.849
 about zombies as we also talk about 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.919
 things that could come to the 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.659
 online mode of apartments and also 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.580
 horses then why do these files 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:01.990
 they would be in the game if they will not be 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.789
 used for nothing rockstar would not lose 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.650
 time if you were not going to use a 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.810
 Hi, what are you doing? 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.130
 secrets are strange files that make 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.720
 we stop to think it will be that 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.500
 could this really come pro game 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.270
 someday 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.090
 remembering that all these codes are 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.580
 in directories that reference dlc 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.930
 which is even more suspicious in the crowd and 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.270
 one last piece of information I have to 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.380
 Here you guys are about leslie. 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.360
 johnson 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.550
 if you do not even know johnson it 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.560
 is a friend of the fountain floor in case you 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.020
 also do not know already the content is the actor 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.699
 who made the game frank lero already posted 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.490
 several pictures there is not too big 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.919
 and links johnson is an actor too 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.440
 friend leave a workout and even excite 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.570
 johnson makes character lamar davis 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.940
 in front of the game guys and look that out 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.500
 He posted an instagram on the photo. 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.700
 What is this photo you see there? 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.830
 As I see he's in a study. 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.600
 looks like it might be the rockstar studio 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.880
 but it looks like he 's recording the audio 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.370
 for something and the picture description 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.520
 says the following by returning to my old 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.590
 work hashtag guess who came back 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.200
 because it's the guys he wrote it on 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.970
 caption of the photo if it until 2013 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.710
 worked with rockstar doing the 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.060
 lamar davis character and he is 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.800
 now saying he's coming back to 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.630
 your old job means not 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.310
 can be anything right guys they 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.710
 are recording and the audios proclaim 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.650

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.610
 confirmation of the actors of the 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.050
 rockstar practically confirming that it is 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.330
 them and the story mode is being 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.770
 really done but the guys that you 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.810
 they think that means a lot of 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.400
 file that you have inside the game is a 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.110
 mount of secret file mount of 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.580

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.860
