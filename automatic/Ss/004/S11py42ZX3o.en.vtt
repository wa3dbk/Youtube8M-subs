00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.190
 welcome to gel fashion checkpoint and the one we offer you a series of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.610
 video analysis however to make you share even if in this place in 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.830
 rather reduced form of those of what is the work we do in 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.590
 afternoons of the white weeks in which we carry out the sex gel courses a full house 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.830
 immersion 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.790
 we will see the students were taken back to the morning on the snow we will see i 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.640
 our demonstrators trying to identify fundamental errors and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 solutions to these errors or in any case try to really understand which one should 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.500
 be the croissant gesture 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.730
 let's see the first student 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.130
 and we move videos 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 let's start the images at normal speed 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.440
 It is possible to positive a certain ability to manage the edge in 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.560
 closing curve a certain sense of rhythm 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 however we also note a vertical extension of the bust with a 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.890
 complete for the bust a back set in the shoulders and this thing 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.920
 it does not make the body move in the right direction and above all on slopes 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 steep can make you trouble ok let's go see the stranger arra slow 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.330
 and we see in the moment of change what happens 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.230
 we stop it and see the extension very vertical 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.640
 and this then leads to a delay in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.000
 the entry into corner grip in the next curve 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 we also stop it in this so we see that on both sides the type 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.240
 of distension eheh identical that is too vertical 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.630
 let's go on a bit more and see that in this phase of entry 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.630
 curve the edge is still not active 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.719
 very backward on this side the relaxation we are going to see now 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.439
 on the blackboard what we should do and then we'll see the demonstrator 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.929
 let's imagine we see the skier from above 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.430
 this is the route taken by the skis 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 this is the line taken by the great mass of the skier, that is from dal 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.010
 trunk and this is the distance of the two paths that we see that is maximum in 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.539
 this area then the skier 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.799
 it should be able to move in the first part of the curve 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.899
 this amount more or less 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.569
 what happens? 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.029
 when 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:06.179
 arrived at this point, the mass is stretched vertically does this 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:08.479
 route 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:14.349
 and therefore in this point of the curve there is not enough inclination for 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.879
 to allow 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.549
 adequate edge hold 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.579
 ok so there is a delay in the development of the angulation movement 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.409
 let's go now see our demonstrator let's see how it behaves 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.159
 right in the phase that goes 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.989
 from this point 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.029
 to this 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.999
 changeover phase steep terrain curve and high speed and the la 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.530
 distension is controlled not vertically 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.120
 so that there is a passage from one angle to the other with the maximum 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.480
 effective jade the entrance into the curve we see it in slow motion we see how the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.560
 body line crosses that of the skis equal angulation already a lot 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.389
 effective a moment 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.979
 and we start from the other side now we stop it in the most demanding phase 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.349
 of the curve to the left in closing 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.119
 and now you will see that the mass of the body cruising the ski line to bring 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:15.379
 immediately towards the inside of the new curve a with the edge that immediately attacks the 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.009
 new curves of the external lower limb that can give strength to create the 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.419
 reaction of the ground that the one that keeps us in trajectory 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.779
 the curve lasts a moment because if the ski is well deformed and you are 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.279
 rounded that you can start for the next curve 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.589
 and therefore a problem of direction of movement not upwards but 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:38.689
 predominantly lateral and forward 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.409
 now let's see on a easier terrain a slightly milder curve but always 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.449
 active round bucket that we see as in the phase of changing the shoulders are 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.960
 on the tips of the toes and are not set back and do not go up and down 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.020
 movement is to remove angle 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.800
 give the new curve an angle - immediately make the edge effective 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.930
 then we saw our demonstrator 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.520
 and how closing this curve already let his body go into 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.710
 then direction of this next curve area 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.650
 summarizing we will be able to tell our student when you are in this area not 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.840
 worry about the end of this curve but be worried rather than starting 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.249
 to go away towards this 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.330
 direction 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.379
 so that your body 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.569
 as they go wider, your body may have this angle 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.759
 allow 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:40.939
 to be well balanced and with deine boots cracked with skis well 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.849
 inclined in edge grip on snow
