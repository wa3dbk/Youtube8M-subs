all

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
all

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.350 
all
what<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> would<00:00:11.400> try<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.790> ground<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.150> just

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
what I would try on the ground is just

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.450 
what I would try on the ground is just
to<00:00:12.450> hop<00:00:12.599> into<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> foot<00:00:13.110> jam<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.530> balance<00:00:14.219> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
to hop into the foot jam and balance and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820 
to hop into the foot jam and balance and
then<00:00:14.969> after<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.480> figured<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.650> try

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
then after I figured that out and we try

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
then after I figured that out and we try
and<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> foot<00:00:17.310> jam<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.699> then<00:00:17.789> hop<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.390> my

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and do a foot jam and then hop to my

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
and do a foot jam and then hop to my
right<00:00:18.720> cuz<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.020> spin<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> right<00:00:19.680> over<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
right cuz I spin to the right over a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.250 
right cuz I spin to the right over a
line<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:20.970> helped<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.449> after<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
line and that helped a lot after I

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.990 
line and that helped a lot after I
figured<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.800> out<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.400> went<00:00:23.820> ahead<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
figured all that out I went ahead and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
figured all that out I went ahead and
took<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> wedge<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.560> started<00:00:25.980> on

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
took it to the wedge first I started on

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
took it to the wedge first I started on
the<00:00:26.490> slant<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> witch<00:00:27.269> she's<00:00:27.840> kind<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
the slant of the witch she's kind of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
the slant of the witch she's kind of
getting<00:00:28.260> rolling<00:00:28.650> into<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> foot<00:00:29.220> jam

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
getting rolling into the foot jam

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.400 
getting rolling into the foot jam
holding<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> foot<00:00:30.570> jam<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> second<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
holding the foot jam for a second and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.930 
holding the foot jam for a second and
then<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.590> were<00:00:31.710> trying<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> hop<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> pull<00:00:32.820> my

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
then I were trying to hop and pull my

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.780 
then I were trying to hop and pull my
arms<00:00:33.239> down<00:00:33.450> towards<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> flat<00:00:34.230> bottom<00:00:34.790> after

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
arms down towards the flat bottom after

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.729 
arms down towards the flat bottom after
I<00:00:36.090> perfected<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.960> went<00:00:37.230> ahead<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> try<00:00:37.680> to

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I perfected that I went ahead and try to

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
I perfected that I went ahead and try to
do<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> deck<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.300> wedge

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

that<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> little<00:00:40.800> bit<00:00:40.920> harder<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> took

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that was a little bit harder and it took

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.700 
that was a little bit harder and it took
a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.910> more<00:00:42.149> technique<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> once<00:00:43.590> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
a little bit more technique and once I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.470 
a little bit more technique and once I
got<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.610> definitely<00:00:44.789> ready<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.300> a

easier<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.460> end<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> dropping<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
easier if your back end is dropping that

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
easier if your back end is dropping that
just<00:01:21.720> means<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.650> nosedive

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just means that you're not nosedive

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
just means that you're not nosedive
enough<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.299> lean<00:01:24.479> forward<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
enough you want to just lean forward a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.870 
enough you want to just lean forward a
little<00:01:24.990> bit<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> vice-versa<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.640> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
little bit more and vice-versa if you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
little bit more and vice-versa if you
happen<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.270> falling<00:01:27.689> forward<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.470> just

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
happen to be falling forward that just

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.929 
happen to be falling forward that just
means<00:01:28.860> you're<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.250> too<00:01:29.369> nosed<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.759> which

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
means you're a little too nosed up which

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
means you're a little too nosed up which
is<00:01:30.060> actually<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.450> good<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.960> means

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is actually a good thing it just means

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
is actually a good thing it just means
you're<00:01:31.409> committed<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.250> start<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you're committed just start not to do it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
you're committed just start not to do it
as<00:01:33.240> much<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.950> you're<00:01:35.670> having<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> hard<00:01:36.150> time

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
as much if you're having a hard time

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
as much if you're having a hard time
getting<00:01:36.900> back<00:01:37.229> into<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> ramp<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:38.250> you're

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
getting back into the ramp when you're

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.039 
getting back into the ramp when you're
in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> foot<00:01:38.909> jam<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.689> ahead<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.990> look

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in the foot jam just go ahead and look

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.600 
in the foot jam just go ahead and look
at<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> flat<00:01:40.530> bottom<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> it'll<00:01:41.220> help<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
at the flat bottom and it'll help you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
at the flat bottom and it'll help you
pull<00:01:41.880> towards<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.409> foot<00:01:43.619> jam<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.070> too

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
pull towards it so foot jam is not too

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
pull towards it so foot jam is not too
