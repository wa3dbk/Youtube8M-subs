00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 The beauty guys in this video here I go 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.030
 You're talking about the metabolic rate. 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.330
 basal to famous tmb what would it be and how 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.510
 calculate is in the case the metabolic rate 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.609
 baseline is the amount of energy your 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
 body needs to maintain the functions 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.420
 vital even while at rest by 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 example the heart beating the organs 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.559
 all working or breathing and these 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.989
 things would not be totally at rest 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.649
 no album activity 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 so for it has this form here this 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.829
 which is a highly regarded formula and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 much used by nutritionists and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 area specialists 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 despite being from 1919 for example the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 the following would have one for the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.480
 men and one for women 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 So he's one of the men who did the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:14.580
 next 66 plus 13 points seven times the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.100
 weight that is put in kilos plus five 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.810
 times the height that is placed in a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 centimeters you average and 80 would 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:30.259
 180 centimeters or only 180 - 6.8 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.220
 green the age put in years 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.590
 So you're going to be picking up the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.320
 calculator to replace these values 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.799
 here you will reach the metabolic rate 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.409
 basal is in the case there was this table that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.390
 so automatically then just vote 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.689
 substituting the values ​​here for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.830
 then one idea here assuming a 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:01.510
 adult is 80 pounds 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:04.030
 one meter, eighty-six, and 29 years old 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:09.190
 therefore it would be the metabolic rate 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.470
 of 1894 calories and that totally in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.150
 rest for those characteristics that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.310
 I put it here is now for the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 women for women have another 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:27.760
 form would also be this 665 plus nine 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:32.110
 points six times the weight given in 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.480
 that one more point 86 height that is 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.520
 placed centimeters - 4.7 live age 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.459
 so I 'll give you an example 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:49.240
 are also points that this woman thesis 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:53.670
 50 kilos and is 1 60 high and one 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.320
 age of 30 years for these 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.900
 characteristics the metabolic rate would be 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.820
 of 1,292 calories, ie to maintain the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.750
 features of a woman's body 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.900
 with these characteristics without activity 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.550
 physics the world 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.010
 then it would be 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.860
 so for those of you who are calculating the 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.820
 nails is only using this shape to 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.180
 women 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.850
 and this formula for men then in the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.739
 next video I'll be speaking to 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:35.260
 respect to the calculation of caloric expenditure is 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.300
 approximate daily using the same 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.330
 form but only from that enters a famous 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.280
 additional line is coming to us 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.989
 values ​​close to this metabolic rate 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.890
 basal 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.739
 she's a rate what kind she has 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:58.630
 some changes but for example to 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:02.050
 changing values or changes to 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.090
 age or weight generally 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.940
 It takes time for a person to 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.849
 A matter of years understood but for example 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.530
 weight may be different and age will 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.660
 increasing as the age goes 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.820
 increasing will decrease this rate 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.609
 basal metabolic rate 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.580
 now if your weight increases it increases 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.669
 also decreasing it also decreases 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.889
 because the cultivation of less energy for 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.070
 keep - mass 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.680
 my activity is not there if someone 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.310
 Did you like your video and was it useful? 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.190
 way is to play a game and subscribe to the 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.490
 channel and as I said I'll do another 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:49.210
 regard to daily caloric expenditure 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.210
 approximate and that's who will raise
