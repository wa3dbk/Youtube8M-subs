use<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.890> feature<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.789> I'm<00:00:48.149> sure

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
use this feature then you know I'm sure

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.470 
use this feature then you know I'm sure
so<00:00:50.760> ya<00:00:50.940> koi<00:00:51.480> cam<00:00:51.750> feature<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.800> basically<00:00:53.480> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so ya koi cam feature it's basically you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
so ya koi cam feature it's basically you
see<00:00:54.629> why<00:00:54.780> did<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.199> inserted<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> new

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
see why did there I just inserted a new

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
see why did there I just inserted a new
camera<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
camera I think this is going to be

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.549 
camera I think this is going to be
mainly<00:00:58.530> used<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.809> tomahawks<00:01:00.809> following<00:01:01.469> them

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
mainly used for tomahawks following them

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.959 
mainly used for tomahawks following them
across<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> map<00:01:02.100> getting<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.579> new<00:01:02.699> angles

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
across the map getting some new angles

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.620 
across the map getting some new angles
on<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.680> viewpoints<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
on the viewpoints for people like

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.740 
on the viewpoints for people like
montage<00:01:07.140> makers<00:01:07.530> edited<00:01:07.920> stuff<00:01:08.040> either<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:09.030> if

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
montage makers edited stuff either or if

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
montage makers edited stuff either or if
it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.250> useful<00:01:11.310> for

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's a pretty be really useful for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
it's a pretty be really useful for
people<00:01:11.820> who<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.240> making<00:01:12.990> their<00:01:13.260> own

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
people who are making their own

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.359 
people who are making their own
machinima<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> basically<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
machinima as well so basically what is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
machinima as well so basically what is
you<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.880> some<00:01:18.030> cameras<00:01:18.420> along<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> path<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you set up some cameras along a path and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
you set up some cameras along a path and
the<00:01:19.979> cameras<00:01:20.369> join<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> next<00:01:21.600> camera

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the cameras join up to the next camera

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.550 
the cameras join up to the next camera
and<00:01:22.220> hey<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> dirty<00:01:24.659> cam<00:01:24.930> mode<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and hey if you're in dirty cam mode and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
and hey if you're in dirty cam mode and
you<00:01:25.680> press<00:01:25.950> play<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.570> dot<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.200> camera

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you press play the dot the camera

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.350 
you press play the dot the camera
follows<00:01:28.890> where<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.700> path<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
follows where you the path of the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.179 
follows where you the path of the
cameras<00:01:30.720> deeper<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> also<00:01:31.950> adjust

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
cameras deeper and you can also adjust

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.100 
cameras deeper and you can also adjust
the<00:01:32.520> speed<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.150> each<00:01:33.299> camera<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:33.990> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the speed of each camera so you can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
the speed of each camera so you can
either<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.470> slow<00:01:34.740> motion<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.280> fast<00:01:35.909> motion

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
either be in slow motion or fast motion

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.580 
either be in slow motion or fast motion
depending<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.630> each<00:01:36.689> camera<00:01:36.990> where<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> set

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
depending on each camera where you set

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.210 
depending on each camera where you set
that<00:01:37.710> setting<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.799> I'm<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:40.979> following

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that setting so see I'm just following

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.060 
that setting so see I'm just following
the<00:01:41.400> tunnel<00:01:41.610> across<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.299> map<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.619> gonna

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the tunnel across the map and I'm gonna

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
the tunnel across the map and I'm gonna
put<00:01:44.340> some<00:01:44.430> cameras<00:01:44.790> around<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.329> guy<00:01:45.570> enough

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
put some cameras around this guy enough

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
put some cameras around this guy enough
effing<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> end<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.649> video<00:01:46.770> I'll<00:01:47.100> show<00:01:47.340> you

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
effing in the end of video I'll show you

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
effing in the end of video I'll show you
how<00:01:47.750> how<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> ends<00:01:49.140> up<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> can't<00:01:50.579> put<00:01:51.060> two

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
how how it ends up you can't put two

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
how how it ends up you can't put two
cameras<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.729> same<00:01:53.970> place<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
cameras in the same place in the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
cameras in the same place in the
timeline<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> fast<00:01:56.790> forward

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
timeline so you can have to fast forward

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
timeline so you can have to fast forward
a<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.450> rewind<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.649> put<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.860> new<00:01:58.979> camera<00:01:59.219> in

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a bit or rewind to put a new camera in

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.690 
a bit or rewind to put a new camera in
you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.600> put<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.049> 50<00:02:01.380> cameras<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.460> clip

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
you can put up to 50 cameras in one clip
