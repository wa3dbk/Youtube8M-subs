this<00:06:48.440> is<00:06:48.590> easiest<00:06:48.950> way<00:06:49.190> I<00:06:49.220> phone<00:06:49.550> it<00:06:49.670> and<00:06:50.540> it

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
this is easiest way I phone it and it

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.970 
this is easiest way I phone it and it
will<00:06:50.780> be<00:06:50.870> the<00:06:50.960> same<00:06:51.170> for<00:06:51.350> other<00:06:51.500> phones<00:06:51.770> like

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
will be the same for other phones like

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.710 
will be the same for other phones like
Samsung<00:06:52.400> and<00:06:52.550> stuff<00:06:52.760> I<00:06:52.910> had<00:06:53.060> Jessica<00:06:53.420> rhythmic

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
Samsung and stuff I had Jessica rhythmic

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.010 
Samsung and stuff I had Jessica rhythmic
France<00:06:54.020> and<00:06:54.260> stuff<00:06:54.560> is<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.310> same<00:06:55.580> thing<00:06:55.990> so<00:06:56.990> I

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
France and stuff is the same thing so I

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.720 
France and stuff is the same thing so I
think<00:06:57.170> it's<00:06:57.410> a<00:06:57.530> free<00:06:57.770> software<00:06:58.010> in<00:06:58.400> the<00:06:58.430> stoner
