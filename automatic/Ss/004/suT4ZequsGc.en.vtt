now<00:03:30.650> you'll<00:03:30.830> notice<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:31.460> if<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.640> see<00:03:31.820> my

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
now you'll notice here if you see my

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.660 
now you'll notice here if you see my
other<00:03:32.000> videos<00:03:32.420> there's<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.720> pattern<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.670> these

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
other videos there's a pattern and these

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.570 
other videos there's a pattern and these
two<00:03:34.970> strings<00:03:35.420> by<00:03:35.780> being<00:03:36.080> opened<00:03:36.710> by<00:03:36.920> leaving

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
two strings by being opened by leaving

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.880 
two strings by being opened by leaving
those<00:03:37.700> two<00:03:37.730> bottom<00:03:38.300> strings<00:03:38.540> open<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.500> gives

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
those two bottom strings open it gives

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.860 
those two bottom strings open it gives
each<00:03:40.100> court<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.520> similar<00:03:41.060> kind<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.450> a<00:03:41.540> brighter

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
each court a similar kind of a brighter

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.760 
each court a similar kind of a brighter
sound<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.070> that's<00:03:43.640> why<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.000> teach<00:03:44.650> instead<00:03:45.650> of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
sound so that's why I teach instead of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.070 
sound so that's why I teach instead of
doing<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.100> G<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:46.640> way<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.209> then<00:03:47.330> B<00:03:47.720> minor

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
doing the G this way and then B minor

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.580 
doing the G this way and then B minor
and<00:03:48.440> then<00:03:48.530> C<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:50.000> D<00:03:50.240> like<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.780> see<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:51.380> you

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590
