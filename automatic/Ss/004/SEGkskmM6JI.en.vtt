00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone, and today I will tell you how 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 you can stick a folder in the folder on the firmware 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.179
 ios 8. 0.2 if you are interested in something 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.179
 stay with me 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.380
 first I have to prove that I have 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.789
 ios 8 is installed for this go to 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.990
 building major about this device and 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.030
 it says that version 8.0. 2 also 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.640
 can indicate what i have widgets 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.910
 the counter center think you believed me then 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.680
 what should i do bus ios 8 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.440
 these manipulations and we need two 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.809
 applications at least 1 created 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.909
 ordinary daddy let's quickly create 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.809
 and here we need to quickly create a butterfly and 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.850
 immediately shove her 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.369
 that's how it all looks giving it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:04.960
 I will repeat for this at the blackboard for them 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:07.240
 butterfly and z and so again we repeat 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.220
 Create a new daddy from two applications 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.320
 and immediately shove the butterfly which 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.200
 standing near the gas like this it all looks 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.880
 and and here there is a cup empty in the folder not 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.030
 Daddy which is located 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.220
 inside so you can also come by me 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.590
 start the application does not fly away 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.910
 it's just such a systemic flaw 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.890
 also we can go out 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.960
 pretty cool if you have 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.720
 a huge number of different applications and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.730
 games and you want to take on your desktop 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.380
 how can you reduce the place you have to 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.450
 create those sweethearts who 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 there are folders and so on let's 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.500
 that they will create a folder that is more rigid 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.950
 subfolders in which folder in 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.869
 folder and so on so on so on 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.939
 see what I could do 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.840
 folder which is in folder which 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.990
 is in the folder 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.600
 if you bought iphone 6 128 gigabyte 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.549
 and you have it just overwhelmed with different 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.039
 applications that even the folder does not save 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.380
 then you can do these daddies 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.720
 where you can shove a huge amount 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 applications this is just like in the place of work 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.390
 the table 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.209
 You can also make a transparent daddy 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.289
 for this we remove all applications 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.099
 leave only daddy that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.160
 is in the folder 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.840
 so now rename as us 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.110
 Well, let's say. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.989
 click ready home and so here 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.670
 it all looks like well if served me 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.900
 then put your thumb up all 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.900
 good luck bye
