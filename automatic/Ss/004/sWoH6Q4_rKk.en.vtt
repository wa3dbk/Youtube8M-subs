00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.000
 I have been asked to repeat the paradox of 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.779
 life 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.779
 and there goes 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.330
 they say that I believe the donkey and told him 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.730
 it will be donkey 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.210
 you work from sunrise to sunset 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 and it will load on your back what it puts you 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.360
 and you will live 35 years and the donkey answered 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.940
 Sir 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.030
 I will be everything you ask but 35 years 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.260
 much 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.260
 because the best will go 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.010
 and god created the donkey 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.730
 then I believe the dog and said you will be 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.990
 dog will take care of the men's house 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 you will see what they give you and you will live 25 years 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.329
 and the dog replied sr 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.810
 I will be everything you ask but 25 years is 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.250
 much 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.250
 because the best 15 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 and god created the dog 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:09.120
 then he created the monkey and said he will be cute 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.630
 for antics to amuse others 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.860
 and you will live 10 years 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.420
 and the happy monkey sir be in everything 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.619
 ask me but maybe I much 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.619
 because no better yes 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 I believe the monkey finally created the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.259
 man and told him you'll be the most 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.960
 smart of the earth 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.970
 you will dominate the world you will live 30 years 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 and the man answered sir 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.570
 I will be everything I ask but 31 is little 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 because they do not give me also the 15 that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.010
 rejected the donkey 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.930
 and the days that the dog stepped on 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.930
 and the five that do not accept the monkey 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.549
 and I believe man 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.360
 and this is how man lives 30 years 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.700
 as men then he marries and lives 15 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.380
 years as a donkey working from sunrise to sunset 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.120
 and carrying on his back the weight of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.470
 the family 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.940
 then they retire 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.850
 live 10 years as dogs 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.640
 taking care of the house eating what they give 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.740
 and ends up living five years as a monkey 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.540
 jumping from house to house of children and 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.550
 doing antics to amuse the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.360
 grandchildren and this is the paradox of life 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.360
 and me 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 and I know I wanted to tell
