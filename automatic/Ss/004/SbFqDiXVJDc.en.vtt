really<00:02:21.980> easy<00:02:22.280> it's<00:02:22.610> easier<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> car<00:02:23.630> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
really easy it's easier with a car so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.230 
really easy it's easier with a car so
I'd<00:02:24.410> recommend<00:02:24.560> an<00:02:24.890> adder<00:02:25.100> not<00:02:25.670> as<00:02:25.820> internal

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
I'd recommend an adder not as internal

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
I'd recommend an adder not as internal
like<00:02:26.360> an<00:02:26.450> adder<00:02:26.630> because<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.990> easier

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
like an adder because it's easier

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
like an adder because it's easier

go down there you guys go 43 out of 50
you<00:04:17.780> know<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.989> gotta<00:04:18.169> do<00:04:18.350> is<00:04:18.530> just<00:04:18.709> you<00:04:18.799> know

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
you know you gotta do is just you know

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.440 
you know you gotta do is just you know
keep<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.160> all<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.519> way<00:04:19.640> around<00:04:19.790> jumping

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
keep going all the way around jumping

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.270 
keep going all the way around jumping
off<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.840> over<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.440> over<00:04:21.560> again<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.190> don't

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
off of it over and over again you don't

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.620 
off of it over and over again you don't
even<00:04:22.430> have<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.669> go<00:04:22.760> find<00:04:23.000> other<00:04:23.180> stunt<00:04:23.419> jumps

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
even have to go find other stunt jumps

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.060 
even have to go find other stunt jumps
you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.720> just<00:04:23.960> keep<00:04:24.050> going<00:04:24.110> around<00:04:24.590> that's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
you can just keep going around that's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.650 
you can just keep going around that's
the<00:04:25.250> reason<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.669> takes<00:04:25.850> so<00:04:26.000> long<00:04:26.090> it's<00:04:26.510> really

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the reason it takes so long it's really

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.540 
the reason it takes so long it's really
is<00:04:26.960> because<00:04:27.229> you<00:04:27.320> have<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:28.310> go<00:04:28.460> around

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
is because you have to just go around

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.580 
is because you have to just go around
that's<00:04:29.210> that's<00:04:29.479> that's<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.050> reason<00:04:30.380> why<00:04:30.530> this

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
that's that's that's the reason why this

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.040 
that's that's that's the reason why this
takes<00:04:31.220> forever<00:04:31.400> but<00:04:31.820> if<00:04:32.600> there<00:04:32.750> was<00:04:32.840> like<00:04:32.930> an

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
takes forever but if there was like an

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.240 
takes forever but if there was like an
easier<00:04:33.320> way<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.440> get<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.800> highway<00:04:34.130> it'd

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
easier way to get on this highway it'd

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.159 
easier way to get on this highway it'd
be<00:04:34.340> shorter<00:04:34.729> and<00:04:34.760> quicker<00:04:35.000> but<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.780> gotta<00:04:35.960> do<00:04:36.080> is

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
be shorter and quicker but I gotta do is

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.320 
be shorter and quicker but I gotta do is
basically<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.650> keep<00:04:36.740> jumping<00:04:36.979> off<00:04:37.330> seabone

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
basically just keep jumping off seabone

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.110 
basically just keep jumping off seabone
where's<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.169> hundred<00:04:39.440> RP<00:04:39.880> sometimes<00:04:40.880> see<00:04:41.030> it

where's the hundred RP sometimes see it

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.930 
where's the hundred RP sometimes see it
takes<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.390> while<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.570> get<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:42.039> but<00:04:43.039> anyways<00:04:43.700> I

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
