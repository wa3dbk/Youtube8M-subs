00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.370
 the kettle pot kachine last 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.290
 generation makes it possible to achieve 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.090
 Substantial energy savings and 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.639
 provides comfort of use without 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.259
 previous indeed the hair boiler 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.849
 allows you to enjoy 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.360
 heat the room in which you 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.340
 you find 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.290
 exactly like a stove 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.210
 classic wood on the other hand his system 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.439
 hydraulic and allows to feed everything 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.419
 like crying a boiler of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.070
 radiators a floor heating or 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.349
 still author of hot water 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.630
 it is the ideal solution to catch 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.649
 all rooms in the house 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.870
 let's see now how that 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.489
 works the main element that 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.039
 guarantee the proper functioning of the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.899
 system and flora box the freebox 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.539
 use for the installation of stoves 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.710
 boiler or cook stove 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.329
 guarantees a constant temperature in 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.670
 the best avoids corrosion and 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.789
 the readiness of the flue and 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.890
 this pet avoids any risk of fire 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.579
 it consists of a circulators of a 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.489
 three month valve 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.109
 and there you go the circulator is 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.940
 driven by a hack remained that one 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.580
 blame maximum output at 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.600
 boiler shock this one set to 60 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.890
 degrees 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.960
 the interest being to allow your 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.910
 pump this cut when your stove 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 is off or when the temperature of 60 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.670
 degrees is not reached 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.050
 but it will also allow water 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060
 contained in the boiler to ride 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 faster in temperature the water 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.110
 stagnant of a lake faster than 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.660
 moving water from a river to 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.460
 start the water circulates in closed circuit and 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.780
 performs a warm exit loop 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 boiler by pass 23 wood and back to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.970
 boiler cold indeed the valve 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 three lanes remain allows until 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.210
 that the water of the loop reach 58 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 degrees then it opens gradually 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.260
 when laban opens totally 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.300
 some of the hot water is directed 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.220
 to a buffer tank and the other part 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.480
 is reinjected on the return so 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.690
 to avoid a temperature differential 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.130
 too important between the dregs the return the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.500
 temperature difference is around 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.640
 10% as can see would be to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.229
 freebox thermometer 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.210
 the water heading towards the balloon is at 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.280
 58 degrees the water back to the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.570
 boiler is at 53 degrees from this 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.520
 How to avoid thermal shock 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.200
 the dew point at the entrance of your 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.910
 happiness 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.069
 it is of course necessary to secure 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.050
 the whole one part with a valve of 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.270
 Thermal wind safety are who 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.680
 is lodged directly in the gluher that has 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.200
 detected an abnormal rise in 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.090
 temperature and secondly with a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.640
 membrane valve which is texts 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 an abnormal rise in pressure you 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.610
 can of course couple is your stove 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.440
 or somewhere else with a solar system or 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 still the couple and to your system of 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.880
 existing heating 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.410
 the kashin boiler is the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.550
 solution to save money 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.730
 chopper all the pieces of your 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.730
 House
