laptops have a really crappy problem
with<00:00:33.910> their<00:00:34.239> chipset<00:00:34.809> so<00:00:35.320> today<00:00:35.650> we're<00:00:35.890> going

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
with their chipset so today we're going

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.740 
with their chipset so today we're going
to<00:00:36.040> fix<00:00:36.309> this<00:00:36.520> with<00:00:36.730> nothing<00:00:36.879> more<00:00:37.120> than<00:00:37.330> a

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
to fix this with nothing more than a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.350 
to fix this with nothing more than a
heat<00:00:38.320> light<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.840> thermal<00:00:41.320> compound<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:42.360> penny

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360

heat light some thermal compound a penny
and<00:00:43.750> some<00:00:44.710> screwdrivers<00:00:46.199> so<00:00:47.199> let's<00:00:48.040> take<00:00:48.309> this

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
and some screwdrivers so let's take this

00:00:48.460 --> 00:01:00.520 
and some screwdrivers so let's take this
a<00:00:48.519> bad<00:00:48.790> boy<00:00:49.030> apart<00:00:49.479> and<00:00:49.780> then<00:00:50.350> fix<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:51.070> for<00:00:51.339> good

pieces over here so you can see
everything<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.990> all<00:01:37.140> over<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> place<00:01:37.670> no<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
everything is all over the place no I

everything is all over the place no I
don't<00:01:39.030> use<00:01:39.180> static<00:01:39.510> bags<00:01:39.870> because<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.950> don't

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
don't use static bags because we don't

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580 
don't use static bags because we don't
do<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.550> don't<00:01:41.580> roll<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.090> over<00:01:42.480> here<00:01:42.660> but

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
do we don't roll like that over here but

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.070 
do we don't roll like that over here but
we<00:01:43.770> do<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.640> piece<00:01:45.120> of<00:01:45.150> cardboard<00:01:45.450> with

some tin foil on it and what we do is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.940 
some tin foil on it and what we do is
the<00:01:51.240> goal<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.110> take<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:53.060> right<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.480> on

the goal is to take this right here on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.840 
the goal is to take this right here on
the<00:01:55.950> opposite<00:01:56.310> side<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:56.580> area<00:01:57.300> right<00:01:57.780> here

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the opposite side this area right here

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.580 
the opposite side this area right here
put<00:01:59.850> this<00:01:59.970> over<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> hole<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.229> underside

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
put this over the hole on the underside

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490 
put this over the hole on the underside
as<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> chip<00:02:02.040> then<00:02:03.030> use<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:03.660> heat<00:02:03.930> lamp<00:02:04.140> right

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
as a chip then use this heat lamp right

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.550 
as a chip then use this heat lamp right
here<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.460> cook<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.720> we're<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> cook

here and cook it and we're going to cook

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
here and cook it and we're going to cook
it<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.100> probably<00:02:08.459> about<00:02:08.729> two<00:02:09.030> minutes<00:02:09.270> maybe

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it for probably about two minutes maybe

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.690 
it for probably about two minutes maybe
a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:09.929> bit<00:02:10.110> more<00:02:10.290> just<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.459> everything

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a little bit more just to get everything

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.600 
a little bit more just to get everything
nice<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.270> hot<00:02:12.630> because<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.800> soldering<00:02:14.280> on

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
nice and hot because the soldering on

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.360 
nice and hot because the soldering on
this<00:02:14.880> ship<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.600> know<00:02:16.320> my<00:02:16.500> camera<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:16.980> no<00:02:17.160> good

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
this ship I know my camera is no good

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.190 
this ship I know my camera is no good
but<00:02:17.670> they're<00:02:18.240> slaughtering<00:02:18.780> around<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
but they're slaughtering around the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.770 
but they're slaughtering around the
edges<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.680> chip<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> bottom<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
edges of this chip and on the bottom and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.740 
edges of this chip and on the bottom and
it's<00:02:21.780> come<00:02:22.790> unsoldered<00:02:23.790> because<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> heat

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's come unsoldered because of the heat

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.510 
it's come unsoldered because of the heat
that<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.170> motherboard<00:02:25.560> generates<00:02:26.190> it's<00:02:26.459> an

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that this motherboard generates it's an

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.199 
that this motherboard generates it's an
HP<00:02:26.750> defect<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.340> they<00:02:29.340> haven't<00:02:29.670> owned<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.180> to

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
HP defect and they haven't owned up to

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.210 
HP defect and they haven't owned up to
fixing<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> ourselves<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:32.190> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
fixing it so we do it ourselves with a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.660 
fixing it so we do it ourselves with a
heat<00:02:32.430> lamp<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.600> now<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:34.709> this<00:02:35.100> we're

have<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:11.480> working<00:03:12.480> machine<00:03:13.700> so

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
have a working machine so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.110 
have a working machine so
prevent<00:03:17.170> boring<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.800> death<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.280> will<00:03:18.400> stop

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
prevent boring you to death I will stop

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.480 
prevent boring you to death I will stop
now<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.480> return<00:03:20.200> back<00:03:20.410> later<00:03:20.920> oh<00:03:23.490> gosh

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
now and return back later oh gosh

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
burning right all right all right we've

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.720 
burning right all right all right we've
kicked<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.130> now<00:03:30.130> we're<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.520> ahead

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
kicked it now we're going to go ahead

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.310 
kicked it now we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:31.140> press<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.410> down<00:03:32.490> really<00:03:33.490> well<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:35.200> get

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
and press this down really well to get

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.840 
and press this down really well to get
the<00:03:35.500> solder<00:03:35.770> back<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.250> place<00:03:37.560> it's<00:03:38.560> really<00:03:39.040> hot

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the solder back in place it's really hot

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.190 
the solder back in place it's really hot
but<00:03:40.210> you<00:03:40.330> need<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.540> hold<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.840> for<00:03:41.020> about<00:03:41.110> a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
but you need to hold it for about a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.470 
but you need to hold it for about a
minute<00:03:41.650> make<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> little<00:03:42.640> bit<00:03:42.760> more<00:03:48.210> i'll<00:03:49.210> go

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
minute make a little bit more i'll go

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.110 
minute make a little bit more i'll go
ahead<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.780> skip<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.770> part<00:03:51.070> now<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.850> can

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
ahead and skip this part now so you can

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.650 
ahead and skip this part now so you can
see<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.570> next<00:03:52.810> segment<00:03:53.370> okay<00:03:54.420> now<00:03:55.420> we're

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
see the next segment okay now we're

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.290 
see the next segment okay now we're
going<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.840> go<00:03:55.930> ahead<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.770> grease<00:03:57.700> out<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
going to go ahead and grease out the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.430 
going to go ahead and grease out the
prop<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.530> GPU<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.690> have<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.900> little<00:04:02.260> bit

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
prop and the GPU so we have a little bit

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.190 
prop and the GPU so we have a little bit
of<00:04:02.470> thermal<00:04:03.130> compound<00:04:03.340> here<00:04:04.050> we're<00:04:05.050> going<00:04:05.140> to

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
of thermal compound here we're going to

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.030 
of thermal compound here we're going to
apply<00:04:05.410> a<00:04:05.500> penny<00:04:05.890> because<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.970> penny<00:04:08.040> actually

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
apply a penny because the penny actually

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.160 
apply a penny because the penny actually
connects<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:11.580> heatsink<00:04:12.580> for<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:12.880> GPU<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:16.170> the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
connects the heatsink for the GPU to the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.360 
connects the heatsink for the GPU to the
extra<00:04:17.590> chip<00:04:17.950> acts<00:04:18.310> as<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.700> bridge<00:04:19.830> we<00:04:20.830> also<00:04:20.980> have

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
extra chip acts as a bridge we also have

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.730 
extra chip acts as a bridge we also have
some<00:04:21.720> silver<00:04:22.720> thermal<00:04:23.140> compound<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
some silver thermal compound on the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.340 
some silver thermal compound on the
processor<00:04:24.340> use<00:04:24.940> better<00:04:25.450> stuff<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.140> that<00:04:26.170> way

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
processor use better stuff so that way

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.620 
processor use better stuff so that way
it<00:04:26.710> doesn't<00:04:27.000> die<00:04:28.000> again<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:30.210> now<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.420> time

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
it doesn't die again and now it's time

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.290 
it doesn't die again and now it's time
to<00:04:31.750> put<00:04:31.900> everything<00:04:31.990> back<00:04:32.410> together<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.850> we'll

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
to put everything back together so we'll

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.130 
to put everything back together so we'll
start<00:04:34.570> putting<00:04:34.870> everything<00:04:35.110> back<00:04:35.470> together

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
start putting everything back together

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.650 
start putting everything back together
so<00:04:38.140> after<00:04:38.500> all<00:04:38.530> that<00:04:38.880> getting<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.000> cardboard

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
so after all that getting the cardboard

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.800 
so after all that getting the cardboard
and<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.710> tin<00:04:41.920> foil<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.790> heat<00:04:42.970> lamp<00:04:43.300> and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
and the tin foil and the heat lamp and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.000 
and the tin foil and the heat lamp and
all<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.140> stuff<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.560> cooking<00:04:44.890> this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
all that stuff and cooking this

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.370 
all that stuff and cooking this
motherboard<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.910> putting<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:46.990> all<00:04:47.110> back

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
motherboard and putting it all back

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.640 
motherboard and putting it all back
together<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:49.450> system<00:04:49.750> those<00:04:50.200> are<00:04:50.380> working

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
together this system those are working

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.980 
together this system those are working
out

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.460 

that<00:04:57.990> uh<00:05:00.440> is<00:05:01.440> easy<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:03.230> everything<00:05:04.230> is

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
that uh is easy is that everything is

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.890 
that uh is easy is that everything is
back<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.680> normal
