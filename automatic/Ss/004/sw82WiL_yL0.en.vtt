 new protest guess 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 I did not translate that 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.100
 or he did not shoot well 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.260
 half high not even right in the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.019
 center 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080
 and can look at it again 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.560
 given the ball boys in front of the list 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.870

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.490

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.390

 [Applause] 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.130

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.090

 that's what we have to the soul and hurt 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.120
 the cheering here over this faded 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.650
 Gladbach eleven meters 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.790
 now it is big 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.920

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.500
 through this gladbacher missschuss 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.500
 [Applause] 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:20.489

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.459
 [Applause] 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:45.350
 the chairman of the league or again 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:48.890
 became a new tenant 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.290
 before the vanished bavaria in the finale 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.790
 up or twelve times in berlin 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.930

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.289
 [Applause] 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.909
 the story is always repeated 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.580

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.120
 The nose in front and that is bitter 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.360
 for the self-sacrificially fighting 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.019
 Gladbach 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.019
 [Applause]
