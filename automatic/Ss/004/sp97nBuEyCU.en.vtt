to lend it to me
but<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.710> reason<00:00:32.009> why<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.369> taking<00:00:32.579> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
but the reason why we're taking this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.700 
but the reason why we're taking this
particular<00:00:33.480> camera<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.170> spin<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
particular camera out for spin is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.569 
particular camera out for spin is
because<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.270> guys<00:00:36.420> asked<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.430> find<00:00:38.430> out

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
because one you guys asked to find out

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
because one you guys asked to find out
what<00:00:38.940> anaconda<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.629> how<00:00:40.020> does<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
what anaconda and how does the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
what anaconda and how does the
performance<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> video<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.760> actual

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
performance of video so this actual

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.440 
performance of video so this actual
camera<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> d7000<00:00:43.559> Nikon<00:00:43.829> d7000<00:00:44.579> allows<00:00:45.180> me

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
camera the d7000 Nikon d7000 allows me

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
camera the d7000 Nikon d7000 allows me
to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> able<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> record<00:00:46.110> video<00:00:46.440> 1080<00:00:47.370> HD<00:00:47.489> which

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to be able to record video 1080 HD which

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
to be able to record video 1080 HD which
is<00:00:48.239> pretty<00:00:48.600> good<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.590> comparables<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> say

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
is pretty good and in comparables to say

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
is pretty good and in comparables to say
a<00:00:50.520> Canon<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.480> guys<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.110> Canon

it's a very very good quality video now
what<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.539> want<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.780> show<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.320> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
what I want to show you right now is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
what I want to show you right now is
actually<00:01:02.579> how<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.969> particular<00:01:03.329> camera

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
actually how this particular camera

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
actually how this particular camera
works<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.470> let's<00:01:04.680> take<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.460> what

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
works so let's take a look at what

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
works so let's take a look at what
happens<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.780> camera<00:01:07.140> has<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.710> call

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
happens this camera has what they call

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
happens this camera has what they call
the<00:01:07.979> automatic<00:01:08.430> focusing<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.030> advantage

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the automatic focusing it's an advantage

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
the automatic focusing it's an advantage
because<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> fact<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> allows<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
because the fact is is that allows it to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.870 
because the fact is is that allows it to
automatically<00:01:12.210> compute<00:01:13.200> early<00:01:13.380> make<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> focus

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
automatically compute early make a focus

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.100 
automatically compute early make a focus
for<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> actually

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
for you so you don't have to actually

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
for you so you don't have to actually
use<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.530> ring<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.549> fast<00:01:17.820> enough

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
use your ring but it's not fast enough

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
use your ring but it's not fast enough
to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.270> able<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.600> he<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.710> has<00:01:19.860> what

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to be able to do he actually has what

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.039 
to be able to do he actually has what
they<00:01:20.189> call<00:01:20.220> automatic<00:01:20.610> server<00:01:21.180> focusing<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
they call automatic server focusing so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
they call automatic server focusing so
there's<00:01:22.259> an<00:01:22.350> object<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.850> actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
there's an object there it will actually

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
there's an object there it will actually
focus<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> person<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
focus on that person so I'm going to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.050 
focus on that person so I'm going to
move<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.740> there<00:01:25.890> you'll<00:01:26.040> focus<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.580> man

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
move it there you'll focus on that man

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
move it there you'll focus on that man
I'll<00:01:27.600> move<00:01:27.750> over<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:28.080> focus<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.680> man

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I'll move over there focus on that man

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
I'll move over there focus on that man
which<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.579> really<00:01:29.880> neat<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> problem<00:01:30.900> is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
which is really neat but the problem is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.810 
which is really neat but the problem is
is<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.290> there's<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.740> many<00:01:31.950> people<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is when there's so many people it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.310 
is when there's so many people it
doesn't<00:01:33.030> know<00:01:33.180> where<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> focus<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
doesn't know where to focus on and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
doesn't know where to focus on and
that's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.829> disadvantage<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.549> something<00:01:35.880> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that's a disadvantage of something like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.120 
that's a disadvantage of something like
this<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> still<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> switch<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:37.860> over

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this so I still have to switch back over

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.789 
this so I still have to switch back over

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
what I mean by that is that you can

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.160 
what I mean by that is that you can
actually<00:01:47.759> fit<00:01:47.970> two<00:01:48.240> SD<00:01:48.540> cards<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> there

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
actually fit two SD cards in there

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.590 
actually fit two SD cards in there
if<00:01:50.799> one<00:01:51.100> fills<00:01:51.759> up<00:01:51.939> whether<00:01:52.299> or<00:01:52.390> not<00:01:52.450> you're

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
if one fills up whether or not you're

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.420 
if one fills up whether or not you're
taking<00:01:52.869> photos<00:01:53.110> or<00:01:53.380> video<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.189> case

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
taking photos or video in this case

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.210 
taking photos or video in this case
we're<00:01:54.670> taking<00:01:54.790> videos<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:55.810> will

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
we're taking videos it will

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.590

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
automatically so therefore you don't get

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.120 
automatically so therefore you don't get
interrupted<00:01:58.899> while<00:01:59.470> you're<00:01:59.710> getting<00:01:59.799> feel

while you're filming as well so that's a

also on automatic focus and while
walking<00:03:13.510> as<00:03:13.930> well<00:03:14.170> I'm<00:03:15.160> trying<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.730> hold<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
walking as well I'm trying to hold the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.220 
walking as well I'm trying to hold the
camera<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.299> steady<00:03:16.450> as<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.750> can

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
camera as steady as I can

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.620 
camera as steady as I can
he<00:03:17.530> actually<00:03:17.829> does<00:03:18.070> that's<00:03:19.000> pretty<00:03:19.209> well<00:03:19.390> for

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
he actually does that's pretty well for

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.080 
he actually does that's pretty well for
without<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.260> image<00:03:20.410> stability<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.640> it's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
without the image stability on and it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.150 
without the image stability on and it's
picking<00:03:22.959> out<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> bit<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.410> vibrations<00:03:23.859> but<00:03:23.980> you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
picking out a bit of vibrations but you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.800 
picking out a bit of vibrations but you
know<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.760> happens<00:03:25.209> when<00:03:25.359> you<00:03:25.450> don't<00:03:25.540> have<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
know it happens when you don't have it

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.220 
know it happens when you don't have it
on<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:26.109> I'm<00:03:26.920> gonna<00:03:27.130> stop<00:03:27.549> this

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
on now I'm gonna stop this

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.220 
on now I'm gonna stop this
and<00:03:29.739> I'm<00:03:30.250> going<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.430> also<00:03:30.730> switch<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.230> image

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
and I'm going to also switch on image

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.410 
and I'm going to also switch on image
stabilization<00:03:32.709> back<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.550> which<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.849> VR<00:03:34.209> here

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
stabilization back on which is VR here

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.360 
stabilization back on which is VR here
and<00:03:35.110> we're<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.440> test<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.920> out<00:03:35.980> as<00:03:36.190> well

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
and we're going to test it out as well

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.460 
and we're going to test it out as well
so<00:03:37.209> let's<00:03:37.330> test<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.660> out<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> see<00:03:37.900> what<00:03:38.050> image

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
so let's test it out to see what image

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.030 
so let's test it out to see what image
stabilization<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.510> on<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.830> image

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
stabilization is with it on the image

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.210 
stabilization is with it on the image
stabilization<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.849> is<00:03:43.150> not<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.800> too<00:03:45.099> much

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
stabilization on is not to to too much

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.130 
stabilization on is not to to too much
difference<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.209> think<00:03:46.720> once<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.989> actually

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
difference but I think once you actually

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.050 
difference but I think once you actually
watch<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.650> out<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.069> video<00:03:48.310> or<00:03:48.580> edit<00:03:48.849> on<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
watch it out on the video or edit on the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.520 
watch it out on the video or edit on the
video<00:03:49.269> you'll<00:03:49.450> actually<00:03:49.690> see<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.170> difference

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
video you'll actually see the difference

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.470 
video you'll actually see the difference
so<00:03:51.069> this<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.370> where<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.580> image<00:03:51.790> stabilized<00:03:52.239> on

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
so this is where the image stabilized on

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.030 
so this is where the image stabilized on
and<00:03:52.750> we're<00:03:53.230> walking<00:03:53.410> around<00:03:53.650> through<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and we're walking around through the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.160 
and we're walking around through the
station<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.550> check<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.910> out<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.049> going

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
station to check it out and it's going

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.740 
station to check it out and it's going
pretty<00:03:56.260> well<00:03:56.440> right<00:03:56.799> now<00:03:56.950> so<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.610> think<00:03:58.360> having

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
pretty well right now so I think having

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.229 
pretty well right now so I think having
image<00:03:59.080> stabilization<00:03:59.709> at<00:04:00.310> pond<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.970> lot

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
image stabilization at pond is a lot

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.890 
image stabilization at pond is a lot
better<00:04:01.360> than<00:04:01.510> not<00:04:01.780> on<00:04:02.080> at<00:04:02.349> all<00:04:03.840> apart<00:04:04.840> from

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
better than not on at all apart from

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.289 
better than not on at all apart from
Nikon<00:04:05.349> surpass<00:04:05.769> sound<00:04:06.340> recording<00:04:07.000> from<00:04:07.150> that

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
Nikon surpass sound recording from that

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.030 
Nikon surpass sound recording from that
external<00:04:07.599> microphone<00:04:08.230> there's<00:04:08.680> actually

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
external microphone there's actually

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.470 
external microphone there's actually
quite<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.310> lot<00:04:09.579> to<00:04:09.790> like<00:04:09.910> about<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.299> camera

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
quite a lot to like about this camera

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.990 
quite a lot to like about this camera
it's<00:04:11.319> got<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.620> automatic<00:04:11.769> focusing<00:04:12.579> function

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
it's got the automatic focusing function

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.210 
it's got the automatic focusing function
built<00:04:13.420> into<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.810> camera<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.290> it's<00:04:14.860> created<00:04:15.160> a

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
built into the camera and it's created a

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.949 
built into the camera and it's created a
video<00:04:15.489> if<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:15.940> just<00:04:16.239> one<00:04:16.419> person<00:04:16.450> being

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
video if it's just one person being

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.620 
video if it's just one person being
filmed<00:04:17.229> having<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.250> dual<00:04:18.519> memory<00:04:18.910> card<00:04:19.150> slot<00:04:19.419> is

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
filmed having a dual memory card slot is

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.990 
filmed having a dual memory card slot is
a<00:04:19.660> plus<00:04:19.930> as<00:04:20.139> well<00:04:20.400> especially<00:04:21.400> when<00:04:21.549> recording

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
a plus as well especially when recording

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.360 
a plus as well especially when recording
video<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.900> know<00:04:23.110> videos<00:04:23.680> take<00:04:23.889> up<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.100> lot

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
video and we know videos take up a lot

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.180 
video and we know videos take up a lot
of<00:04:24.400> space<00:04:24.960> after<00:04:25.960> taking<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.650> Nikon<00:04:26.950> for<00:04:27.160> a

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
of space after taking the Nikon for a

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.010 
of space after taking the Nikon for a
field<00:04:27.400> test<00:04:27.610> I'm<00:04:27.940> quite<00:04:28.330> impressed<00:04:28.690> with<00:04:28.870> its

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
field test I'm quite impressed with its

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.530 
field test I'm quite impressed with its
video<00:04:29.290> mode<00:04:29.530> though<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.550> still<00:04:30.910> find<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.240> Canon

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
video mode though I still find the Canon

00:04:31.540 --> 00:05:07.660 
video mode though I still find the Canon
a<00:04:31.660> lot<00:04:32.020> more<00:04:32.260> user-friendly

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.730
