to make sure that this fuse here has
continuity<00:02:39.580> going<00:02:40.120> through<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.810> means

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
continuity going through it that means

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.060 
continuity going through it that means
that<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> fuses<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:43.120> good<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.260> open<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:44.980> then

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
that the fuses so good and open and then

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.759 
that the fuses so good and open and then
we'll<00:02:45.220> let<00:02:45.630> electricity<00:02:46.630> go<00:02:46.810> flow<00:02:47.380> through<00:02:47.650> it

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
we'll let electricity go flow through it

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.050 
we'll let electricity go flow through it
to<00:02:48.010> get<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.400> control<00:02:48.640> board<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.880> so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
to get to the control board and it is so

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.420 
to get to the control board and it is so
good<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.269> next<00:02:55.810> thing<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.560> want<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.769> do<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.040> make

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
good so next thing we want to do is make

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.240 
good so next thing we want to do is make
sure<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.610> breaker<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.209> okay<00:03:01.860> we<00:03:02.860> have<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.100> make

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
open and we have nothing we're going to

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:15.140 
open and we have nothing we're going to
close<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:06.940> see<00:04:07.240> if<00:04:07.870> we<00:04:08.050> get<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.230> continuity

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.380 

back<00:04:16.150> one<00:04:16.299> clue<00:04:16.480> is<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:18.090> because<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.269> the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
back one clue is it because that the

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:38.350 
back one clue is it because that the
angle<00:04:19.720> was<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.610> okay<00:04:23.190> let's<00:04:24.190> try<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.490> again

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:53.540 

we<00:04:39.360> got<00:04:39.480> cut<00:04:39.690> nudity<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.200> one

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.600 

I'm<00:04:54.420> going<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.750> cut<00:04:54.870> nuni<00:04:55.140> at<00:04:55.230> that<00:04:55.350> one<00:04:55.610> so

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
I'm going to cut nuni at that one so

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.710 
I'm going to cut nuni at that one so
next<00:04:56.850> thing<00:04:56.940> we're<00:04:57.210> going<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.450> want<00:04:57.600> the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
next thing we're going to want the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.270 
next thing we're going to want the
checks<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.050> make<00:04:58.230> sure<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.530> power<00:04:59.070> is

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
checks to make sure that power is

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.530 
checks to make sure that power is
actually<00:04:59.400> going<00:04:59.760> through<00:04:59.850> the<00:05:00.000> control<00:05:00.330> board

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
actually going through the control board

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.590 
actually going through the control board
to<00:05:00.750> do<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.260> we<00:05:01.860> do<00:05:01.980> have<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.310> push<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.360> switch

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
to do so we do have to push the switch

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.480 
to do so we do have to push the switch
up<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:03.960> then<00:05:04.140> check<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.440> power<00:05:04.980> at<00:05:05.310> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
up and then check the power at the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.220 
up and then check the power at the
control<00:05:05.760> board<00:05:05.790> itself<00:05:06.270> so<00:05:06.840> we're<00:05:07.050> going<00:05:07.140> to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
control board itself so we're going to

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.280 
control board itself so we're going to
check<00:05:07.470> at<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.920> white<00:05:08.190> wire<00:05:08.550> on<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.990> control

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
check at the white wire on the control

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.380 
check at the white wire on the control
board<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:16.620> black<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.670> white<00:05:17.730> wire

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
board and and the black and white wire

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.680 
board and and the black and white wire
here<00:05:19.640> we<00:05:20.640> have<00:05:20.760> power<00:05:21.030> coming<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.480> unit

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
here we have power coming to the unit

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.550 
here we have power coming to the unit
we're<00:05:21.810> going<00:05:21.900> to<00:05:21.960> run<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.200> through<00:05:22.230> a<00:05:22.350> rinse

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
we're going to run it through a rinse

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.990 
we're going to run it through a rinse
cycle<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.950> make<00:05:22.980> sure<00:05:23.190> everything's<00:05:23.580> okay<00:05:23.880> and

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
cycle to make sure everything's okay and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.250 
cycle to make sure everything's okay and
doesn't<00:05:24.300> leak<00:05:24.450> but<00:05:25.050> we<00:05:25.710> had<00:05:25.860> found<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:27.260> melted

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
doesn't leak but we had found a melted

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.350 
doesn't leak but we had found a melted
wire<00:05:28.650> nut<00:05:28.890> down<00:05:29.100> below<00:05:29.910> where<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.180> power

wire nut down below where the power

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.840 
wire nut down below where the power
comes<00:05:30.600> in<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:33.690> had<00:05:33.810> three<00:05:34.080> spliced<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.530> wire

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
comes in and we had three spliced a wire

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.600 
comes in and we had three spliced a wire
because<00:05:35.850> this<00:05:35.970> one<00:05:36.150> was<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.330> little<00:05:36.420> burnt<00:05:36.750> and

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
because this one was a little burnt and

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.560 
because this one was a little burnt and
now<00:05:38.610> we're<00:05:38.760> getting<00:05:38.910> powered<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.330> control

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
now we're getting powered to the control

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.510 
now we're getting powered to the control
board<00:05:39.840> okay<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:40.590> right<00:05:40.830> now<00:05:40.980> but<00:05:41.190> unit<00:05:41.430> is

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
board okay so right now but unit is

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.120 
board okay so right now but unit is
actually<00:05:41.640> so<00:05:42.030> full<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.300> water<00:05:42.510> because<00:05:42.780> it

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
actually so full of water because it

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.230 
actually so full of water because it
stopped<00:05:44.130> you<00:05:44.640> know<00:05:44.670> in<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:44.910> middle<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.180> a

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
stopped you know in the middle of a

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.330 
stopped you know in the middle of a
cycle<00:05:45.600> so<00:05:45.780> we're<00:05:45.930> going<00:05:46.080> to<00:05:46.230> go<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:46.980> cancel

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
cycle so we're going to go in and cancel

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.220 
cycle so we're going to go in and cancel
a<00:05:47.400> brain<00:05:47.670> to<00:05:48.510> make<00:05:48.630> sure<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.900> drain<00:05:49.080> pump

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
a brain to make sure the drain pump

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.470 
a brain to make sure the drain pump
comes<00:05:49.470> on<00:05:49.650> drains<00:05:50.190> out<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.460> water<00:05:50.640> and<00:05:51.000> then

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
comes on drains out the water and then

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.760 
comes on drains out the water and then
we'll<00:05:51.630> go<00:05:51.750> ahead<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:51.960> start<00:05:52.110> on<00:05:52.320> the<00:05:52.500> little

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
we'll go ahead and start on the little

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.280 
we'll go ahead and start on the little
rinse<00:05:53.100> cycle<00:05:53.550> fill<00:05:54.120> up<00:05:54.330> water<00:05:54.600> make<00:05:54.960> sure<00:05:55.110> the

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
rinse cycle fill up water make sure the

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.830 
rinse cycle fill up water make sure the
motor<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.580> main<00:05:56.730> motor<00:05:56.940> does<00:05:57.180> rotate<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.780> the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
motor the main motor does rotate and the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.670 
motor the main motor does rotate and the
water<00:05:58.020> does<00:05:59.780> go<00:06:00.780> where<00:06:00.930> it's<00:06:01.020> supposed<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.380> and

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
water does go where it's supposed to and

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.370 
water does go where it's supposed to and
then<00:06:01.830> we<00:06:01.950> will<00:06:02.100> drain<00:06:02.310> it<00:06:02.430> out<00:06:02.550> one<00:06:02.880> more<00:06:02.910> time

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
then we will drain it out one more time

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.540 
then we will drain it out one more time
