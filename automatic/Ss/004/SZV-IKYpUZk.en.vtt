00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.060
 we are here in the presence of the head of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.610
 American circus track that is in 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.230
 basin from September 20 to September 30 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 can tell us how he becomes head of 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.340
 track specifically what would be his 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.650
 position and the track boss does not 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.200
 exactly the king and be more than anything what 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.610
 that my function would be exactly what 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.369
 that it is within the show to say what 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.410
 that people see not to organize the boss 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.629
 of track is the one behind is 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.969
 behind the scenes that is responsible for 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:40.039
 to foresee that nobody fails to warn anymore 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.160
 every case of track boss is going to be 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.200
 a lot of improvisation is a show 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.150
 very variable absolutely of all 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.980
 many contrasts and it's about not 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.560
 you notice absolutely nothing nothing of 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.750
 all this if we liked during the 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.870
 show that is very side in what 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 is the theme of continuity between a 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.699
 number and another imagine that part of the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 merit is from the presenter in his case not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.080
 more faces of the management team biography 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.870
 and else 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.690
 we learned that trick there are things that are 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.950
 absolutely unpredictable as per 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.270
 example behavior an animal that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.730
 can come a little more slowly 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.190
 so when there's a little voice 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.410
 background says hey we went to the next 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.900
 you have to change that without being noticed 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.570
 standards like this is like a program that 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.930
 leads marcelo are structurally 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.010
 the greatest merit is of production type 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.820
 in type of choreography and creation 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.810
 He has been working for many years 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.230
 show a little more in the care 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.730
 right now five years old 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.160
 thing that comes from the show business 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.040
 a show I started as an amateur and 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.500
 I am also 5 years old and then went down to 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.330
 the circuses but be quite more 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.350
 like of course like everyone who 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.729
 enters 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.369
 is a very closed world or is it allowed 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.770
 to integrate into the good is sometimes maybe 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.640
 the difficulty is mobility us other 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.240
 times as much as closed not a little bit 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.520
 of 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.390
 classic difficulties the fact of the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.700
 continuity with routes change of routes 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.050
 very long and others but it is not so 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 different with many times can 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.070
 seem like the main thing is almost 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.070
 the adventurous spirit not by the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.440
 mobility or I do not know that it is more than anything 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.330
 spirit of being able to transmit them is not 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 exclusive to say really is not so 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.840
 to venture so different a person to be able to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.300
 of course an example I have a 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.460
 caravan and I can say that they lived 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.990
 the arrival is something very different or 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.730
 you really do not have a bathtub so 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.650
 This studio ceramic massage study 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.990
 once you open the door it's exactly 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.060
 just like any house during not this 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.069
 wheat is not something so so different 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.430
 Thank you very much for attending to us 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.430
 you
