00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.470
 good room after a bit of teacher 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 armorer will not come well this Sunday of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.099
 done when he says it with the other day of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.769
 that we can do a series will be called 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.240
 Sunday teacher or something like that to many 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.600
 they liked it which surprised me a little 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 that we started you when they take us 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.410
 they are not already in the fourth most weapon 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.870
 missing a few shots with him jn 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.330
 gel but good nothing happens the thing is 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.830
 I had to tell you one thing 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.700
 that I already started saying yes the other day and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.890
 is the subject of the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.990
 what's going on with an automatic weapon that's going to be 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.560
 a problem 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.570
 is the subject of the direct 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.310
 and it's that a lot of fancy me 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.760
 make this game and climb waves because 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.440
 today just as master Sunday gunsmith 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.320
 I wanted to comment and it's that I'm going to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.880
 try to do a live from the first day 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.510
 of the hart line beta that is one thing 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.370
 that you have told me several yes 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.990
 It's probably good and it will be 3 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 obviously because that's when 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.740
 the beta starts what I have a little 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.340
 uncertain is the time but almost certainly 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 will be 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.470
 at 7 that is a pretty hour 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.220
 standard for both sides of the puddle 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.280
 Let's say 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.280
 ah 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.580
 if you keep changing maybe you give 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.320
 someone 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.200
 in short let's see if we can trace 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.330
 this thing is that I'm going to try 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.800
 make a live that in fact if you carry 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.360
 long time in Cana we will remember that 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.670
 with the battlefield beta 4 I tried 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.910
 do the same thing and in fact start even 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.620
 the direct but I did not hit the pc now 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.420
 I have the new graphics of a processor 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.550
 new and I have already made several productions 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.550
 so there should not be any problem 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.079
 but good to see where you are 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.979
 Let's see how it gives us this 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.619
 avatar and others as you see we are in 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.030
 over as not because there is no way to 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.079
 play on another map that does not activate not 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 is taken into account with a hacker 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.829
 and, as much as I like it 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.969
 find me with hackers I can not do it 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.810
 I can not do it as often as I 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.610
 would like 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.110
 Obviously this is nothing I do not like 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.800
 what about the hacker but it was funny to see 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.510
 that some said look 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.240
 if it suits you well, yes, the truth is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.640
 that came pretty 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.400
 do not kill me man and now it 's carles a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.380
 pretty bad weapon for short but 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.840
 good hip everything can be done 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.610
 work hip which is one thing that 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.260
 Many of you miss that he has so much 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.480
 hip 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 I like it 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.590
 and we're at short distances so it's 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.940
 quite useful as you see also we carry 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.940
 a laser then hey all help 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.070
 a shake of the penalty sale lol if 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.540
 we caught this is going to be 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.790
 apotheosis we go though of course if I start 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080
 with four weapons I do not get four 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.000
 advantage weapons because I can not either 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.660
 expect too much to guide what we can 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.450
 do 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.710
 but good going back to the direct 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.780
 after two minutes and we talked about 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.280
 random things 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.590
 I would recommend that you follow me 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 twitter because at the moment it will be at 7 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 on February 3 Spanish time 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 but if there is any change because 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.580
 you know how the streaks go if you fall behind or 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.080
 if something happens then I'll have to say 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.270
 by twitter since I'm not going to make a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.890
 video 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.980
 I'm not going to make a video obviously 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.280
 only through the wall at least is the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.930
 feeling that gives 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.459
 so then I would recommend that if 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.630
 you want out there if I have to do 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.290
 some change but I'm going 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.400
 quite excited about the direct ones is 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.480
 something you carry asking me for 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.650
 a lot of time is something that I have 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.680
 wanting to do for quite some 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.680
 weather 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 in principle we will make several direct 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.569
 direct garden increase is 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.890
 confirmed the rest I do not know because 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.890
 stories are emerging 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.600
 they require my attention 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.800
 so I do not know how it will go during the rest 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.390
 of the beta 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.590
 but good when it pulls out of the vein 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.060
 I guess I also play some of 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.360
 master armorer as I told you in that one 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.360
 video 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.100
 13 we are not the end the uf 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.849
 three years it takes to recharge this 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.849
 weapon by god 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.230
 come on 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.320
 one day I think 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.310
 I do not like to go around here because always 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.870
 there is a turkey 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.900
 I did not know we're cutting a 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.699
 bit 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.320
 we can not cut more if we win 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.009
 it would be pretty cool a comeback 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.569
 curious 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.339
 but good on this server for 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.050
 unfortunately I too server is not the 

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:42.610
 same you see that the rotation is different 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.969
 well they also have the axis I do not like 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.969
 kill me 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.990
 because it is the first but it also has 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.550
 the lg you know what desperates me 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.689
 that's because you can be there first 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.200
 for a long time 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.800
 is 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.800
 that grave 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.289
 us what has happened to him 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.660
 you can be there for a long time 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.940
 and the lvg is very unfair 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.260
 let's see what happens the last one 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.980
 first you have reached the last 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.980
 weapons i mean 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.780
 in 19 look good has behaved well 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.569
 this things 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.470
 Web 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.090
 Sun 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.810
 these people who put you right in front 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:31.500
 and teleporting gives me confidence 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.500
 children 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.120
 if you're focused looking for 86 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.070
 flying 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.520
 come man do not load md with lvg 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.520
 please 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.610
 taking 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.380
 he shouted in the satisfactory head that it was 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.240
 the hand for god I think I tell you about 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.510
 done in each video every time it's so 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.510
 good 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.800
 a man do not kill me so many times that 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.800
 I have to catch the turkey this 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.380
 on the right we can do it 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.780
 we can do anything withdrawal 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:22.260
 you do not see me 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.050
 to see here by the side 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.940
 come on 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.970
 it is not worth it is thrown 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.260
 We can not do it with a sword 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.640
 nothing less that payment think it takes 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.170
 little pin because it is not normal what of the 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.850
 teleportation if such that usually happens 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.850
 when they have very little ping 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.259
 Obviously the uncle is also good 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.259
 so that 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.340
 they have not been lowered with the axis true yes 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.749
 675 is working 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.880
 a little more in extremis then not 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.500
 We are maintaining a good ratio 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.490
 I do not pretend that either, and less if the other 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.490
 uncle carries the knife there 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:09.789
 come on man to see what bad luck 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.929
 we are having no less is being at 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.610
 19 I'm very strong said good we see 

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.849
 I have lost supports include you 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.849
 forever 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.759
 do not 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.080
 what a pity finished second now 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:28.320
 well it's wrong to finish second when 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.750
 entered with four handicap weapons 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:34.509
 but well what has been said must give the subject 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.190
 of the direct if you want to suggest me some 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:38.110
 another hour then I'm in quotes 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.240
 open to changes but for now it will be 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.280
 7 on day 3 was invented and we have 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.350
 perhaps there is some change and good nothing else 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.430
 what to say has been in the game of 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.430
 teacher at least my opinion
