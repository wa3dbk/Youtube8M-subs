that now and either side of that
connector<00:03:41.920> we've<00:03:42.190> got<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.520> speakers<00:03:43.000> and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
connector we've got the speakers and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.760 
connector we've got the speakers and
then<00:03:43.570> we've<00:03:43.720> also<00:03:43.810> got<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> three-and-a-half

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
then we've also got the three-and-a-half

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.310 
then we've also got the three-and-a-half
millimeter<00:03:45.220> audio<00:03:45.430> jack<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.120> then<00:03:46.930> round<00:03:47.170> on

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
millimeter audio jack and then round on

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.010 
millimeter audio jack and then round on
this<00:03:47.500> side<00:03:47.800> we<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.340> got<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.180> SIM<00:03:49.720> card<00:03:49.750> tray

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
this side we have got the SIM card tray

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.160 
this side we have got the SIM card tray
and<00:03:50.440> then<00:03:51.310> across<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> top<00:03:52.060> we've<00:03:52.720> got<00:03:52.960> what

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
and then across the top we've got what

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.470 
and then across the top we've got what
looks<00:03:53.410> like<00:03:53.590> an<00:03:53.920> IR<00:03:54.280> blaster<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:55.120> another

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
looks like an IR blaster and another

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.320 
looks like an IR blaster and another
microphone<00:03:55.930> just<00:03:56.500> across<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.890> top<00:03:57.100> no<00:03:57.790> volume

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
microphone just across the top no volume

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.110 
microphone just across the top no volume
up<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.630> down<00:03:58.780> because<00:03:59.020> they<00:03:59.380> are<00:03:59.560> actually

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
up and down because they are actually

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.640 
up and down because they are actually
integrated<00:04:01.120> onto<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.630> back<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.170> very<00:04:02.500> very

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
integrated onto the back so very very

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.830 
integrated onto the back so very very
different<00:04:03.040> design<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.640> g2<00:04:04.060> got<00:04:04.690> some

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
different design on the g2 got some

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.810 
different design on the g2 got some

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
just here we've got the volume up and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.940 
just here we've got the volume up and
down<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.980> we've<00:04:09.700> also<00:04:09.850> got<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.530> power<00:04:11.530> button
