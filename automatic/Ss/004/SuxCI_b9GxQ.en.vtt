many years I simply used my water bath
canner<00:02:06.460> that<00:02:07.460> works<00:02:07.790> perfectly<00:02:08.360> fine<00:02:08.660> so

canner that works perfectly fine so

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.690 
canner that works perfectly fine so
don't<00:02:09.110> go<00:02:09.320> out<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.619> buy<00:02:09.769> a<00:02:09.799> crock<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.459> just

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
happen to find this one and it's quite

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.119 
happen to find this one and it's quite
large<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.840> guess<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.560> what<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:16.099> number

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
large I guess it's what a number

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.710 
large I guess it's what a number
I<00:02:17.159> can't<00:02:18.120> turn<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:19.040> number-10<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.299> got<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
I can't turn it a number-10 and I got it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.100 
I can't turn it a number-10 and I got it
for<00:02:21.930> $35<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> thought<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.299> was<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> great<00:02:24.780> deal

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
for $35 so I thought it was a great deal

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.440 
for $35 so I thought it was a great deal
so<00:02:26.099> what<00:02:26.220> I've<00:02:26.340> got<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:27.120> I've<00:02:27.269> got

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so what I've got to do now is I've got

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.210 
so what I've got to do now is I've got
to<00:02:27.569> put<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:27.780> brine<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.579> my<00:02:29.760> brine<00:02:30.030> is<00:02:30.390> is
