when<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:01.920> fishing<00:00:02.070> for<00:00:02.340> freshwater

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
when I'm fishing for freshwater

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120 
when I'm fishing for freshwater
predators<00:00:03.330> like<00:00:03.570> Pike<00:00:03.929> perch<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.560> Zander<00:00:04.920> and

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
predators like Pike perch and Zander and

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.769 
predators like Pike perch and Zander and
I'm<00:00:05.279> trying<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.609> find<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.879> lure<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.120> works<00:00:06.450> I

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
I'm trying to find a lure that works I

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.339 
I'm trying to find a lure that works I
like<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.620> try<00:00:07.770> different<00:00:07.950> body<00:00:08.309> profiles<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
like to try different body profiles and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.259 
like to try different body profiles and
one<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> profiles<00:00:11.010> are<00:00:11.400> trying<00:00:11.820> out<00:00:11.969> again

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
one of the profiles are trying out again

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.530 
one of the profiles are trying out again
is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> fat<00:00:12.870> bodied<00:00:13.230> type<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.269> they<00:00:15.269> can<00:00:15.450> be

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
is the fat bodied type and they can be

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.160 
is the fat bodied type and they can be
pretty<00:00:15.719> good<00:00:16.039> for<00:00:17.039> perch<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.699> Zander<00:00:18.170> not

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
pretty good for perch and for Zander not

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.840 
pretty good for perch and for Zander not
so<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.650> pike<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.189> try<00:00:20.520> them<00:00:20.699> for

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
so much for pike but I do try them for

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.099 
so much for pike but I do try them for
pike<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.330> once<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> while<00:00:21.930> they'll

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
pike because once in a while they'll

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.730 
pike because once in a while they'll
pull<00:00:22.320> something<00:00:22.650> out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.920> bag<00:00:23.130> now<00:00:24.740> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
pull something out of the bag now the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
pull something out of the bag now the
thing<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.849> fat<00:00:27.119> bodied<00:00:27.449> Lewis's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
thing about these fat bodied Lewis's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.419 
thing about these fat bodied Lewis's
they've<00:00:27.960> got<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> lot<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> buoyancy<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.890> them<00:00:29.099> or

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
they've got a lot of buoyancy in them or

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.240 
they've got a lot of buoyancy in them or
some<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> them<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:29.970> anyway<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.070> find<00:00:32.070> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
some of them have anyway and I find that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.180 
some of them have anyway and I find that
they<00:00:32.489> work<00:00:32.669> better<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.300> pike<00:00:33.770> when<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.040> can

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
they work better for pike when you can

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
they work better for pike when you can
work<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.520> lures<00:00:35.760> more<00:00:35.969> erratically<00:00:36.390> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
work the lures more erratically in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
work the lures more erratically in
milder<00:00:37.170> weather<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.280> bit<00:00:38.399> cold<00:00:38.640> at

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
milder weather it's a little bit cold at

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.520 
milder weather it's a little bit cold at
the<00:00:38.879> moment<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.510> shall<00:00:39.690> still<00:00:39.930> try<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> fat

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the moment but I shall still try a fat

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
the moment but I shall still try a fat
body<00:00:40.680> blur<00:00:41.300> while<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.480> trying<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> find

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
body blur while I'm trying to find

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.540 
body blur while I'm trying to find
something<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> catch<00:00:43.770> pike<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.830 

it's<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> matter<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.270> working<00:00:48.660> through

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's really a matter of working through

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.260 
it's really a matter of working through
them<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.140> finding<00:00:49.469> something<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.800> works

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
them and finding something that works

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
them and finding something that works
that<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.539> off<00:00:51.690> probably<00:00:51.899> discount<00:00:52.440> because

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that one off probably discount because

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
that one off probably discount because
it's<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.399> dives<00:00:53.640> quite<00:00:53.940> deep<00:00:54.180> he's<00:00:54.930> probably

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's it dives quite deep he's probably

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's it dives quite deep he's probably
too<00:00:55.410> deep<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> venue<00:00:56.449> that<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.690> has<00:00:57.930> got

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
too deep for this venue that one has got

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
too deep for this venue that one has got
a<00:00:58.109> shallow<00:00:58.410> working<00:00:58.859> lip<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
a shallow working lip and got a lot of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.880 
a shallow working lip and got a lot of
buoyancy<00:01:00.510> that's<00:01:00.780> probably<00:01:01.050> too<00:01:01.260> shallow

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
buoyancy that's probably too shallow

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.579 
buoyancy that's probably too shallow
so<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.789> between<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.449> found<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.049> clacking

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
so in between I found a little clacking

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.920 
so in between I found a little clacking
crank<00:01:04.920> which<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.970> will<00:01:06.119> work<00:01:06.240> down<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> about

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
crank which this will work down to about

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
crank which this will work down to about
three<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> five<00:01:07.979> feet<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.520> perfect<00:01:09.060> for

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
three to five feet which is perfect for

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.469 
three to five feet which is perfect for
this<00:01:09.240> venue<00:01:10.460> it's<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.850> color<00:01:12.090> it's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
this venue it's the right color it's

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
this venue it's the right color it's
similar<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.650> roach<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> perch

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
similar to the the roach in the perch

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.539 
similar to the the roach in the perch
that<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> pike<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.299> chasing<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.549> when

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that the pike is chasing here and when

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.210 
that the pike is chasing here and when
the<00:01:17.670> waters<00:01:17.970> cold<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> try<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> small

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the waters cold I do like to try a small

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.210 
the waters cold I do like to try a small
lure<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> you'd<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.810> surprised<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.470> you'd<00:01:23.070> be

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
lure and you'd be surprised in you'd be

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
lure and you'd be surprised in you'd be
quite<00:01:23.400> surprised<00:01:23.990> big<00:01:24.990> Pike<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.470> take

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
quite surprised big Pike will take

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
quite surprised big Pike will take
smaller's<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.000> that's<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
smaller's so that's what I'm going to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.850 
smaller's so that's what I'm going to
start<00:01:28.409> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
start with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.069 
start with
it<00:01:29.490> wouldn't<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.030> ideal<00:01:30.390> choice<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it wouldn't be my ideal choice for the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
it wouldn't be my ideal choice for the
day<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.650> I'm<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> give<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
day but I'm going to give it a go and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.090 
day but I'm going to give it a go and
see<00:01:33.619> whether<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> pipe<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.920 

well<00:01:43.100> I'll<00:01:43.190> have<00:01:43.370> to<00:01:43.460> go<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:43.700> this<00:01:43.850> swim<00:01:44.180> it's

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
well I'll have to go in this swim it's

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.300 
well I'll have to go in this swim it's
quite<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> shallow<00:01:45.440> swim<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.010> water's

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
quite a shallow swim and the water's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.720 
quite a shallow swim and the water's
cold

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
cold

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.090 
cold
and<00:01:47.410> I'm<00:01:48.410> going<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.620> try<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:48.950> these

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
and I'm going to try one of these

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.370 
and I'm going to try one of these
fatbody<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.850> crankbaits<00:01:50.330> I've<00:01:50.600> chosen<00:01:51.050> quite

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
fatbody the crankbaits I've chosen quite

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.860 
fatbody the crankbaits I've chosen quite
a<00:01:51.410> small<00:01:51.740> one<00:01:51.920> actually<00:01:52.220> because<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.760> know<00:01:53.570> from

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
a small one actually because I know from

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.290 
a small one actually because I know from
experience<00:01:54.050> of<00:01:54.680> this<00:01:54.770> pit<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.430> pike<00:01:56.120> are

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
experience of this pit that the pike are

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.900 
experience of this pit that the pike are
feeding<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.750> small<00:01:56.900> perch<00:01:57.370> of<00:01:58.370> about<00:01:58.729> that

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
feeding on small perch of about that

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.109 
feeding on small perch of about that
size<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.540> it's<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.780> right<00:01:59.930> size<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.030> it'll<00:02:02.030> go

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
size so it's the right size and it'll go

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.780 
size so it's the right size and it'll go
down<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.540> right<00:02:02.690> depth<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.490> collars

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
down to the right depth and the collars

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:20.410 
down to the right depth and the collars
not<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.150> far<00:02:05.360> out
