00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
also works on serrated edges the secret
is<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.549> rods<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:36.060> flexible<00:01:36.720> they're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
is this the rods are flexible they're

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
is this the rods are flexible they're
actually<00:01:37.259> under<00:01:37.500> heavy<00:01:37.770> spring-loaded

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
actually under heavy spring-loaded
tension<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> there's<00:01:39.630> more<00:01:39.900> spring-loaded

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
tension and there's more spring-loaded

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tension on the top angle and that's why

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
tension on the top angle and that's why
we're<00:01:43.259> using<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.280> blade<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we're using it because that blade is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
we're using it because that blade is
literally<00:01:45.710> 3-dimensional<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> rod

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
literally 3-dimensional we want that rod

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.910 
literally 3-dimensional we want that rod

to come up and over and down each one of
those<00:01:50.040> serrations<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> we're<00:01:50.939> using<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
those serrations and we're using the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
those serrations and we're using the
polishing<00:01:51.960> rod<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.829> we're<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.430> to
