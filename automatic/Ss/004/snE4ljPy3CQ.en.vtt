as<00:01:03.600> far<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> didn't<00:01:04.530> die<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.949> swiped<00:01:05.250> for

that<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.760> maybe<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.690> had<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.050> little

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
that one maybe I just had just a little

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.010

10<00:03:09.890> yards<00:03:10.280> let's<00:03:10.460> see<00:03:10.670> look<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.270> my<00:03:11.360> plate<00:03:11.630> yeah

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.110 

I<00:03:15.680> think<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.370> pretty<00:03:16.610> much<00:03:16.730> how<00:03:16.850> I'm

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
I think this is pretty much how I'm

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.430 
I think this is pretty much how I'm
gonna<00:03:17.270> have<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.540> do<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.690> on<00:03:17.840> their<00:03:17.960> backing<00:03:18.350> out

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
gonna have to do it on their backing out

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.530 
gonna have to do it on their backing out
too<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:18.770> they're<00:03:18.890> gonna<00:03:19.010> they<00:03:19.850> jump<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.270> snap

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
too so they're gonna they jump the snap

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.110 
too so they're gonna they jump the snap
but<00:03:20.870> that's<00:03:21.050> not<00:03:21.170> gonna<00:03:21.410> need<00:03:21.650> much<00:03:22.120> jumpsuit

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
but that's not gonna need much jumpsuit

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:33.160 
but that's not gonna need much jumpsuit

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
kick off that I did that would have been

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.080 
kick off that I did that would have been
a<00:04:12.140> perfect<00:04:12.350> opportunity<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.430> do<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.640> squib<00:04:14.060> kick

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
a perfect opportunity to do a squib kick

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.840 
a perfect opportunity to do a squib kick
because<00:04:14.900> I<00:04:14.990> tried<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.470> before<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.610> video

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
because I tried it before on a video

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.120 
because I tried it before on a video
that<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.180> didn't<00:04:17.480> record<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.020> it<00:04:18.500> works<00:04:18.770> fine<00:04:18.920> I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
that I didn't record and it works fine I

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.700 
that I didn't record and it works fine I
mean<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.610> actually<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.600> doesn't<00:04:20.840> like<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.500> think

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
mean it actually it doesn't like I think

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:22.990 
mean it actually it doesn't like I think
that<00:04:21.830> in<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.100> past<00:04:22.250> games<00:04:22.580> when<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.820> used<00:04:22.970> to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
that in the past games when I used to

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.330 
that in the past games when I used to
have<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.180> squib<00:04:23.390> kick<00:04:23.420> it<00:04:24.200> would<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.590> go<00:04:25.070> low

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
have a squib kick it would like go low

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.190 
have a squib kick it would like go low
but<00:04:25.520> it'll<00:04:25.670> go<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.210> somebody<00:04:26.690> this<00:04:27.020> one

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
but it'll go right to somebody this one

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.440 
but it'll go right to somebody this one
actually<00:04:27.380> bounces<00:04:28.070> around<00:04:28.190> on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.670> field<00:04:29.000> and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
actually bounces around on the field and

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.850 
actually bounces around on the field and
it<00:04:29.660> takes<00:04:29.900> people<00:04:30.170> time<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.530> get<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.040> ball

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
it takes people time to get to the ball

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.670 
it takes people time to get to the ball
but<00:04:33.860> uh<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:35.000> that's<00:04:35.180> okay<00:04:35.510> i<00:04:35.540> mean<00:04:35.750> at<00:04:36.170> least<00:04:36.200> I

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
but uh but that's okay i mean at least I

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.100 
but uh but that's okay i mean at least I
mean<00:04:36.830> that's<00:04:36.950> July<00:04:37.370> thirteenth<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.150> can<00:04:38.810> say

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
mean that's July thirteenth I can say

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.500 
mean that's July thirteenth I can say
that<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.440> game<00:04:39.680> cheated<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.580> can't<00:04:41.300> say

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
that the game cheated I can't say

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.750 
that the game cheated I can't say
because<00:04:41.690> there<00:04:42.170> was<00:04:42.320> my<00:04:43.010> own<00:04:43.220> mistake<00:04:43.610> for

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
because there was my own mistake for

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.940 
because there was my own mistake for
kicking<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.150> ball<00:04:44.330> off<00:04:44.600> like<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.080> everybody

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
kicking the ball off like that everybody

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.400 
kicking the ball off like that everybody
bunched<00:04:46.430> up<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:46.700> the<00:04:46.820> middle<00:04:47.060> up<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.960> don't<00:04:48.320> know

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
bunched up in the middle up I don't know

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.370 
bunched up in the middle up I don't know
why<00:04:49.250> they<00:04:49.430> did<00:04:49.640> that<00:04:49.670> but<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.570> then<00:04:51.350> I

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
why they did that but and then I

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.320 
why they did that but and then I
couldn't<00:04:51.830> make<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.190> tackle<00:04:52.460> he<00:04:52.820> broke<00:04:53.060> loose

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
couldn't make the tackle he broke loose

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.110 
couldn't make the tackle he broke loose
and<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:55.040> happens<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.580> happens<00:04:56.030> in

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
and and that happens that happens in

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.610 
and and that happens that happens in
college<00:04:56.420> football<00:04:56.570> quite<00:04:57.050> often<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.470> you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
college football quite often that you

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.570 
college football quite often that you
have<00:04:57.890> these<00:04:58.070> crazy<00:04:58.400> comebacks<00:04:59.120> so<00:05:00.080> uh<00:05:00.580> yeah

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
have these crazy comebacks so uh yeah

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.500 
have these crazy comebacks so uh yeah
that<00:05:01.940> was<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.470> pretty<00:05:03.820> interesting<00:05:04.820> game<00:05:05.240> there

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
that was a pretty interesting game there

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.480 
that was a pretty interesting game there
I<00:05:05.720> probably<00:05:06.500> would<00:05:06.710> have<00:05:06.770> did<00:05:06.920> better<00:05:06.950> at<00:05:07.370> the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
I probably would have did better at the

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.100 
I probably would have did better at the
beginning<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.180> had<00:05:08.390> I<00:05:08.419> not<00:05:08.600> been<00:05:08.660> trying<00:05:09.020> to

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
beginning and had I not been trying to

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.810 
beginning and had I not been trying to
do<00:05:09.230> a<00:05:09.260> lot<00:05:09.440> of<00:05:09.500> commentary<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.430> describing

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
do a lot of commentary and describing

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.159 
do a lot of commentary and describing
some<00:05:11.090> things<00:05:11.330> I<00:05:11.450> could<00:05:11.600> have<00:05:11.630> been<00:05:11.750> focused

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
some things I could have been focused

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.159 
some things I could have been focused
more<00:05:12.320> but

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
more but
