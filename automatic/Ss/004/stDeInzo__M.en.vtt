gone<00:00:38.180> professional<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.199> lot<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.350> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
gone professional and a lot of the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.630 
gone professional and a lot of the
professional<00:00:39.890> techniques<00:00:40.250> were<00:00:40.460> probably

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
professional techniques were probably

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.189 
professional techniques were probably
coming<00:00:40.910> into<00:00:41.059> schoolboy<00:00:41.480> rugby<00:00:41.809> at<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:41.989> time

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
coming into schoolboy rugby at the time

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.630 
coming into schoolboy rugby at the time
and<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:42.590> think<00:00:42.890> they<00:00:43.010> looked<00:00:43.160> back<00:00:43.310> at<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.430> lot<00:00:43.520> of

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
and I think they looked back at a lot of

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.840 
and I think they looked back at a lot of
fond<00:00:43.760> memories<00:00:43.790> of<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.210> time<00:00:46.750> Leo<00:00:47.750> was<00:00:48.850> very

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
fond memories of the time Leo was very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.139 
fond memories of the time Leo was very
very<00:00:50.329> quiet<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:51.460> remember<00:00:52.460> when<00:00:52.610> he<00:00:52.640> came<00:00:52.970> for

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
very quiet I remember when he came for

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.330 
very quiet I remember when he came for
pre-season<00:00:53.630> training<00:00:53.750> in<00:00:54.200> May<00:00:54.530> he<00:00:55.190> was

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
pre-season training in May he was

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.010 
pre-season training in May he was
actually<00:00:55.489> very<00:00:55.700> skinny<00:00:56.270> I<00:00:56.510> mean<00:00:56.660> there<00:00:56.809> wasn't

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
actually very skinny I mean there wasn't

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.389 
actually very skinny I mean there wasn't
a<00:00:57.050> pic<00:00:57.170> of<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.350> kid<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.739> he<00:00:58.219> wasn't

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
a pic of the kid and he wasn't

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.040 
a pic of the kid and he wasn't
particularly<00:00:58.940> tall<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.660> I<00:00:59.719> remember<00:00:59.960> looking

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
particularly tall and I remember looking

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.110 
particularly tall and I remember looking
and<00:01:00.230> thinking<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.010> know<00:01:01.130> if<00:01:01.610> he's<00:01:01.790> gonna<00:01:01.880> make

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
and thinking to know if he's gonna make

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.880 
and thinking to know if he's gonna make
the<00:01:02.210> team<00:01:02.329> of<00:01:02.480> where<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:02.690> can<00:01:02.809> use<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.079> guy<00:01:03.320> he
