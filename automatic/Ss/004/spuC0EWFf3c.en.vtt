the box that used to go and pick him up

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.850 
the box that used to go and pick him up
what<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> does<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:42.200> expands<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> lungs<00:00:43.500> better

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
what it does it expands the lungs better

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.029 
what it does it expands the lungs better
it<00:00:44.640> makes<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.360> makes<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.690> work<00:00:45.899> harder<00:00:46.620> with

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it makes it makes you work harder with

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.690 
it makes it makes you work harder with
your<00:00:47.190> breathing

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
your breathing

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060 
your breathing
it<00:00:48.480> stops<00:00:48.780> fighters<00:00:49.170> doing<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.590> every<00:00:49.920> five

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
it stops fighters doing this every five

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
it stops fighters doing this every five
minutes<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.030> sort<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> aids<00:00:51.719> them<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.350> think

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
minutes it sort of aids them to think

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.590 
minutes it sort of aids them to think
about<00:00:52.860> opening<00:00:53.730> their<00:00:53.879> lungs<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
about opening their lungs up it and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.850 
about opening their lungs up it and
keeping<00:00:54.899> their<00:00:55.020> bodies<00:00:55.350> straight<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
keeping their bodies straight in the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.840 
keeping their bodies straight in the
hands<00:00:56.070> above<00:00:56.219> their<00:00:56.430> head<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:56.789> they're

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hands above their head when they're

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
hands above their head when they're
trying<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.149> recover<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
trying to recover so it's a really

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
trying to recover so it's a really
really<00:00:59.520> good<00:00:59.789> drill<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.390> people<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.809> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
really good drill to get people out of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.910 
really good drill to get people out of
that<00:01:01.079> habit<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> also<00:01:03.690> work<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.379> with

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that habit and you can also work it with

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
that habit and you can also work it with
some<00:01:05.820> drill<00:01:06.060> work<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> end<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
some drill work at the end up with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
some drill work at the end up with
either<00:01:07.260> kicks<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.799> knees<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.369> what

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
either kicks or knees which is what

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.450 
either kicks or knees which is what
we're<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.159> very

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
we're going to do now it's very very

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.890 
we're going to do now it's very very
hard<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.970> harder<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> looks

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
hard it's harder than it looks

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.359 
hard it's harder than it looks
you've<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> make<00:01:13.680> sure<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> they<00:01:14.130> touch

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you've got to make sure that they touch

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.210 
you've got to make sure that they touch
the<00:01:14.520> ground<00:01:14.790> both<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> ends<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the ground both at the ends and at and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
the ground both at the ends and at and
of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> pads<00:01:17.850> okay<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.720> very

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
of the pads okay it's very very

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
of the pads okay it's very very
important<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.500> they're<00:01:19.650> bending<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
important that they're bending all the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.410 
important that they're bending all the
time<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.670> they're<00:01:20.790> never<00:01:20.909> getting<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> full

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
time so they're never getting a full

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
time so they're never getting a full
line<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> air<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.680> lot<00:01:22.860> harder<00:01:23.070> than

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
line of air so it's a lot harder than

00:01:23.250 --> 00:02:12.090 
line of air so it's a lot harder than
ordinary<00:01:23.880> sprinting<00:01:24.360> okay

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.949 

okay<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.160> we<00:02:13.370> usually<00:02:13.550> do<00:02:13.850> four<00:02:14.209> reps<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.750> this

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
okay so we usually do four reps of this

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.650 
okay so we usually do four reps of this
or<00:02:15.920> five<00:02:16.280> depending<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:16.910> how<00:02:17.090> many<00:02:17.240> rounds

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
or five depending on how many rounds

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.480 
or five depending on how many rounds
they're<00:02:17.780> fighting<00:02:18.170> okay<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:18.950> mix<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.459> with

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
they're fighting okay can mix it with

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.240 
they're fighting okay can mix it with
either<00:02:19.970> intense<00:02:20.480> boxing<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.200> kick<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.680> with

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
either intense boxing we kick you with

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.060 
either intense boxing we kick you with
knees<00:02:22.700> as<00:02:22.970> we've<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.180> done<00:02:23.720> okay<00:02:24.410> don't<00:02:24.890> give

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
knees as we've just done okay don't give

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.430 
knees as we've just done okay don't give
them<00:02:25.190> too<00:02:25.340> much<00:02:25.490> break<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.970> between<00:02:26.440> maximum

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
them too much break in between maximum

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.590 
them too much break in between maximum
of<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.709> 30<00:02:27.950> seconds<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.330> get<00:02:29.450> that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
of like 30 seconds just to get that

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.010 
of like 30 seconds just to get that
recovery<00:02:30.080> up<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.560> want<00:02:30.860> them<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.250> dreading

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
recovery up you want them to be dreading

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.690 
recovery up you want them to be dreading
even<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.140> second<00:02:33.620> rep<00:02:33.770> even<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> third<00:02:34.400> rep

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
even the second rep even the third rep

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030 
even the second rep even the third rep
okay<00:02:35.000> there<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.270> need<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.810> train<00:02:36.739> their<00:02:37.010> mind

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
okay there you need to train their mind

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
okay there you need to train their mind
to<00:02:37.459> be<00:02:37.610> able<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.850> do<00:02:38.000> more<00:02:38.239> than<00:02:38.300> they<00:02:38.600> might

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
to be able to do more than they might

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.240 
to be able to do more than they might
think<00:02:38.989> they<00:02:39.230> can<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.769> very<00:02:39.800> very

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
think they can do it's very very
