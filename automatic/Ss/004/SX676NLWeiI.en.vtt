00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
demonstrate that there's a thing that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.529 
demonstrate that there's a thing that
sort<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:29.720> thing<00:00:30.280> that's<00:00:31.280> usable<00:00:32.000> performance

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
sort of thing that's usable performance

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.810 
sort of thing that's usable performance
of<00:00:32.629> that<00:00:32.660> or<00:00:33.530> uh<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:34.250> know<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> weird<00:00:34.670> way

more like things like that so you Eddie
has<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> lot<00:01:55.800> of<00:01:55.830> slower<00:01:56.130> music<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.760> dark<00:01:56.970> it's

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

darker and moodier and a lot of that is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.650 
darker and moodier and a lot of that is
happening<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.030> strings<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.600> in

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
that goes on in the second movement to a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:03:03.550 
that goes on in the second movement to a
lot<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.500> sort<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:44.710> rippling<00:02:45.710> kinds<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.370> Moody

well<00:03:44.939> there's<00:03:45.150> some<00:03:45.329> actually<00:03:45.719> what<00:03:45.989> happens

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
well there's some actually what happens

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.780 
well there's some actually what happens
there's<00:03:46.620> things<00:03:46.889> where<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.189> banjo<00:03:47.459> starts<00:03:47.700> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
there's things where the banjo starts to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.629 
there's things where the banjo starts to
go<00:03:47.879> into<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.870> -<00:03:49.079> for<00:03:49.409> fafsa<00:03:49.980> fans<00:03:50.219> are<00:03:50.430> kind<00:03:50.579> of

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
go into the - for fafsa fans are kind of

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.069 
go into the - for fafsa fans are kind of
playing<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.120> sort<00:03:51.389> of<00:03:51.450> may<00:03:51.719> be<00:03:51.780> waiting

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
playing that you sort of may be waiting

00:03:52.079 --> 00:04:09.730 
playing that you sort of may be waiting
for<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:52.829> there's<00:03:53.129> patterns<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.639> this

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:24.740 

but<00:04:10.740> then<00:04:10.890> even<00:04:11.040> later<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:12.330> goes<00:04:12.600> into<00:04:23.750> but

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
but then even later it goes into but

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.750 
but then even later it goes into but
just<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.110> short<00:04:25.290> time<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:26.370> for<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.640> short

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
just for a short time this for a short

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.000 
just for a short time this for a short
time<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:28.050> that's<00:04:28.410> in<00:04:28.650> G<00:04:28.830> major

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
time and and that's that's in G major

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.070 
time and and that's that's in G major
which<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.640> banjo<00:04:29.850> key

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
which is the banjo key

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.600 
which is the banjo key
it<00:04:31.350> tastes<00:04:31.680> at<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> end<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.100> piece<00:04:32.250> before

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
it tastes at the end of the piece before

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.550 
it tastes at the end of the piece before
we<00:04:32.730> get<00:04:32.850> to<00:04:32.970> G<00:04:33.150> major<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.230> suddenly

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
we get to G major and and suddenly

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.140 
we get to G major and and suddenly
you're<00:04:34.680> in<00:04:34.740> home<00:04:35.130> turf<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:35.700> even<00:04:35.970> something

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
you're in home turf so even something

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.090 
you're in home turf so even something
like<00:04:36.240> what<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.510> just<00:04:36.720> played<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.500> actually<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.950> G

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
like what I just played is actually in G

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.490 
like what I just played is actually in G
sharp<00:04:38.370> minor<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.000> when<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.840> play<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.200> G<00:04:40.320> sharp

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
sharp minor and when you play in G sharp

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.770 
sharp minor and when you play in G sharp
minor<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.250> G<00:04:41.430> -<00:04:41.610> in<00:04:41.760> banjo<00:04:42.150> you<00:04:42.300> have<00:04:42.480> a<00:04:42.510> great

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
minor in a G - in banjo you have a great

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:54.200 
minor in a G - in banjo you have a great
tension<00:04:43.020> between<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.500> G<00:04:52.669> sharp<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:53.910> G<00:04:54.090> major

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
tension between the G sharp and G major

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.350 
tension between the G sharp and G major
G<00:04:54.960> sharp<00:04:55.140> minor<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.710> G<00:04:55.740> G<00:04:56.460> major<00:04:56.730> happening<00:04:57.270> at

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
G sharp minor and G G major happening at

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.300 
G sharp minor and G G major happening at
the<00:04:57.450> same<00:04:57.600> time<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:58.410> eventually<00:04:58.530> we<00:04:58.980> actually

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
the same time but eventually we actually

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.890 
the same time but eventually we actually
want<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.550> get<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.820> G<00:05:00.000> near<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.630> end<00:05:00.750> of<00:05:00.840> the

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
want to get to G near the end of the

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.450 
want to get to G near the end of the
piece<00:05:01.080> well<00:05:01.740> that's<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.040> that's<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.280> very

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
piece well that's it that's a very

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.180 
piece well that's it that's a very
classical<00:05:03.120> concept<00:05:03.630> a<00:05:03.810> very<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.830> know<00:05:04.860> Mozart

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
classical concept a very you know Mozart

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.430 
classical concept a very you know Mozart
Haydn<00:05:05.520> Beethoven<00:05:05.730> concept<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.690> trying<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:06.960> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
Haydn Beethoven concept of trying to the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.020 
Haydn Beethoven concept of trying to the
instrument<00:05:07.979> that's<00:05:08.100> analogy<00:05:08.550> trying<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.850> find

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
instrument that's analogy trying to find

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.469 
instrument that's analogy trying to find
his<00:05:09.120> way<00:05:09.240> home

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
his way home

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.170 
his way home
right<00:05:10.290> everything<00:05:10.979> before<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.640> creating

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
right everything before that is creating

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.120 
right everything before that is creating
all<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.300> sort<00:05:12.690> of<00:05:12.750> dramatic<00:05:12.990> tension<00:05:13.380> right

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
all that sort of dramatic tension right

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.010 
all that sort of dramatic tension right
that's<00:05:14.640> a<00:05:14.760> piece<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.270> no<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.540> can't<00:05:15.660> say<00:05:15.990> that

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
that's a piece of it no I can't say that

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.510 
that's a piece of it no I can't say that
I<00:05:16.169> did<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.440> like<00:05:16.710> one<00:05:16.919> of<00:05:17.010> those<00:05:17.130> guys<00:05:17.280> would

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
I did it like one of those guys would

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.370 
I did it like one of those guys would
have<00:05:17.550> done<00:05:17.760> but<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.390> definitely<00:05:19.050> had<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.290> in

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
have done but I definitely had that in

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.760 
have done but I definitely had that in
mind<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:19.890> had<00:05:20.040> other<00:05:20.250> things<00:05:21.650> trying<00:05:22.650> to

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
mind and I had other things trying to

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.140 
mind and I had other things trying to
get<00:05:22.919> me<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.100> G<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.169> piece<00:05:25.380> moves<00:05:26.310> that

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.779 

thing<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.330> go<00:05:30.479> G<00:05:31.110> but<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:31.919> never<00:05:32.100> happens<00:05:32.550> or

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.580 

gee<00:05:36.789> but<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.270> doesn't<00:05:37.569> happen<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.319> there's<00:05:38.530> a

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
gee but it doesn't happen and there's a

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.980 
gee but it doesn't happen and there's a
big<00:05:38.800> Orchestra<00:05:39.009> moves<00:05:39.580> bom<00:05:39.910> bom<00:05:40.180> bom<00:05:40.690> bom

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
big Orchestra moves bom bom bom bom

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.980 
big Orchestra moves bom bom bom bom
bom-bom<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:42.490> then<00:05:43.090> go<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.240> another<00:05:43.389> part<00:05:43.750> and

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
bom-bom and then go to another part and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.719 
bom-bom and then go to another part and
that<00:05:44.560> happens<00:05:44.860> several<00:05:45.099> times<00:05:45.220> through<00:05:45.639> the

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
that happens several times through the

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.189 
that happens several times through the
piece<00:05:45.909> so<00:05:46.780> it's<00:05:46.960> like<00:05:47.169> gee<00:05:48.129> but<00:05:48.580> denied<00:05:49.199> denied

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
piece so it's like gee but denied denied

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.339 
piece so it's like gee but denied denied
denied<00:05:50.889> and<00:05:51.370> then<00:05:51.460> finally<00:05:51.849> g<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.870> we're

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
denied and then finally g and we're

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:53.700 
denied and then finally g and we're
there

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
there

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.830 
there
so<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.550> matter<00:05:54.789> that<00:05:54.909> is<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.180> real<00:05:55.389> classical

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
so that matter that is a real classical

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.820 
so that matter that is a real classical
move

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.890
