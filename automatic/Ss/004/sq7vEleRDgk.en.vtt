00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello in this video I'm going to you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
 show how to make a good 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 ratatouille for about four 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.110
 people first you need some 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.250
 missing red peppers be a big like 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.760
 you can see here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.279
 or so two 'small' to 7 to you of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 see what you have you what you 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 find that then then you need 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.940
 a clove of garlic to decorate a little 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.610
 the rate of zucchini onions 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.399
 eggplants and rates but that's it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 about 3 zucchini of eggplants 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.090
 some small tomatoes and oil 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 olive to decorate everything 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.110
 so first step to start with 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 put oil to Lille at the bottom of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.129
 your pan so take a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
 pan big enough because with the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 quantity of vegetables that we cooked at these 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.129
 buildings 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.710
 so that's why bah jean enoch sold as 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.120
 you can see it here 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.560
 during this time we will take care of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 onions so here's your dough once 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:19.020
 peeled she's a raise from a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 knife of small gaps we will move forward 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.900
 the video so here is now the lay 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.829
 so same process as for the onion 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.659
 park or do some pretty big chunk 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:37.460
 so as you can see so that's it 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 once onions and and there there 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.759
 incorporate into our pot 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 here you leave him golden with 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.829
 an olive at the bottom a little water during 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 this time even as real bao cuts out 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:54.180
 vegetables while garlic and onion 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.399
 of gold one operates at the cutting of the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 zucchini 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.240
 so here we do depend 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.460
 by keeping the skin to look at the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.460
 room here now lauder gym 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.769
 here is the origin it is a little harder 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.120
 the thicker fault we see there 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.120
 not so to relax them 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.019
 so here is now the sweet pepper 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:27.360
 so you can see I thought 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:31.970
 the big or so a saleswoman 24 on 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.970
 remove all the surplus 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.630
 and then we will make small dice by the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.870
 after 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.160
 now here will freeze the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:03:04.590
 bring extract see a store at 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:03:05.970
 cold of each ingredient then have 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:15.000
 switched to cutting in my job 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:17.819
 verviers in two in four years if one 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.120
 govern a little bit to easily make 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.680
 little dice here's the position is not 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.850
 not necessary and so we will 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:36.530
 put to cook and 4 and to the very fauna 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.530
 process for zucchini 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 you do that with the number of holidays 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:10.489
 this is for peppers idem to finish 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.870
 its cutting with those of tomatoes have 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:17.450
 like dice so here's where 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.820
 we can see that there are many 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.500
 regret so now make a 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.500
 recourse and cut vegetables 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.380
 so we see that vegetables cut in 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 the pan with the garlic and onion background 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.790
 so here is in the last meters this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.650
 tribute good here I do it like that 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.120
 so much lose as little as possible 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.630
 the tomato juice of a cushion not to 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.650
 put last on this is us 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.180
 you are trying to stir everything so that's it 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.280
 he was not worried about the height at 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.340
 start because when cooking it 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.910
 then reduces the level of the 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.830
 saucepan said will know well drunk so makes 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:18.000
 now you add a little bit of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:19.760
 salt to always think of a meter at the top 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:30.419
 tracks 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:32.840
 so I now believe trees of 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.840
 Provence 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.380
 so here is no hesitation to put all his 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:51.300
 did you give logo vegetables and water is 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.970
 so now last step before the 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.430
 cooking so put some water so 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.710
 here it takes pretty much you imagine 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.990
 that you have to line the bottom of your 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.690
 cooking pot 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.180
 so that's about it will be necessary to imagine 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:11.729
 two fingers at the bottom so here you are 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:15.210
 put accordingly so that's so 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.970
 once all friends cover you and you 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.810
 let simmer an hour and 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:26.550
 half sweet fire that will welcome 30 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.520
 come on we'll restart the video here 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.289
 we come back after more than two hours 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:37.650
 cooking so we come back that it has 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:41.520
 reacted and we see tasted with 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.860
 happiness so voila it was confiera a 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.259
 ratatouille house pen 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.750
 nice presentation and is simple to do 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:51.960
 I hope this video will have you 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.320
 more and we'll tell each other soon and no 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.320
 tasting
