melons are there with melon slices so it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.420

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.340 
across over here to a little wheat farm
I<00:01:44.490> mean<00:01:45.270> obviously<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.630> already<00:01:45.960> had<00:01:46.140> wheat

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
I mean obviously we already had wheat

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.740 
I mean obviously we already had wheat
but<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> food<00:01:47.640> video<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> guess<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
but this is a food video so I guess the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.330 
but this is a food video so I guess the
guys<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.110> killing<00:01:49.350> some<00:01:49.380> time<00:01:49.500> x<00:01:49.890> minus<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
guys just killing some time x minus a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.639 
guys just killing some time x minus a
week<00:01:50.840> obviously<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.020> those<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.320> know

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
week obviously for those you don't know

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.139 
week obviously for those you don't know
well<00:01:52.979> yeah<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.640> who<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
well yeah for those who don't know you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
well yeah for those who don't know you
can<00:01:54.390> turn<00:01:54.540> wheat<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:54.990> bread<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.950> about

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
can turn wheat into bread as it's about

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.370 
can turn wheat into bread as it's about
to<00:01:56.219> show<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> second<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.229> i<00:01:58.320> said

i think it's just killing a bit time for
the<00:01:59.909> other<00:02:00.030> food<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> cook<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.200> it
