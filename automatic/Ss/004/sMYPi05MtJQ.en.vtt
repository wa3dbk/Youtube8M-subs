00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.569 

also<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.230> classic<00:00:42.589> that<00:00:42.739> all<00:00:42.859> black<00:00:43.070> outfit

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
also the classic that all black outfit

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.369 
also the classic that all black outfit
is<00:00:43.760> simple<00:00:44.239> it's<00:00:44.359> easy<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.750> throw<00:00:44.899> on<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
is simple it's easy to throw on but the

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.930 
is simple it's easy to throw on but the
main<00:00:45.559> focus<00:00:45.589> here<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.129> on<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.460> textures

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
main focus here is on the textures

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.700 
main focus here is on the textures
because<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.750> materials<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.500> fluffy

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
because the materials of the fluffy

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.289 
because the materials of the fluffy
jumper<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.339> leather<00:00:49.460> shorts<00:00:49.820> contrast

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
to each other it actually helps to

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.970 
to each other it actually helps to
emphasize<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.339> textures<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.789> lot<00:00:53.030> more
