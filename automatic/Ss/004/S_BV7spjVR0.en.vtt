00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.390
 Orlando Florida is the pumpkin juice and 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.330
 the butter beer with the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.350
 beers was something very funny because 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.350
 I asked for it 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.470
 and I had in front of the letter with the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.720
 prices then I realized that I 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.720
 they were charging like 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.489
 that will be some I think four 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.039
 dollars more I do not really remember well 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 the price but there was very little 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.809
 difference that they were charging me I said 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.860
 Well, maybe they changed the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 prices and said that in the pay but 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.880
 and as soon as they brought it to me I realized 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.250
 of what help help the vessels 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.080

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.330
 of the two the two are delicious this 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.330
 it's like he knows 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.100
 It tastes totally butter but as 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.750
 I would say, there are videos on the internet 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.760
 like how to make a beer 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.770
 butter because if it has the flavor of 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.540
 beer but actually like to like 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.710
 it is not beer itself, this can be taken 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.770
 children and well I am a minor 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.540
 I just tried them the beer over there 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.610
 from the tavern of the three magicians the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.230
 classic from there the house is rich 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.340
 but I really did not like it very much it's very 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.310
 very bitter it 's dark it's very bitter and I'm going 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.040
 to make a video with pictures of the park and 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.650
 I have other videos that I took there are 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.420
 shorties of some small things but 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.260
 Well, I'll talk a little more about the 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.090
 park at another time and about the 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:29.380
 drinks is like what it tastes 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.420
 it opened like chantilly in the foam that 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.690
 is on the top is chantilly 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.670
 I would say because he knows a lot about that or 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.920
 be that you can have a drink of 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.550
 butter with chantilly ice knows 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.770
 practically 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.030
 but you feel the flavor that leaves you 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.610
 a beer like that fermentation is what 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.850
 magic of this drink and about this one 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.920
 it's totally a fruit juice it's very 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.569
 rich and more than I can accompany it with 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.090
 my food that was still 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:05.280
 what is a name 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.560
 a thigh or a leg a dive here 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.680
 turkey like the one that eats Christmas 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.510
 she depends on her legs but they are 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.270
 extremely salty are very salty 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.600
 then with this game you can remove me 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.280
 the very sweet of this game I take away the 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.180
 the extreme salty taste of de york's and 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.610
 of the leg this turkey is called ex turkey 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.229
 It is very rich but it is very salty then 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.419
 they sell it in the tavern of the three 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.700
 magicians this is distributed throughout the 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.639
 park you find it in almost any 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:46.240
 place in any park store 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:48.729
 thematic and they have it cold and at the time 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.639
 but they have it in refrigeration I suppose 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.380
 me because it's juice actually and 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.750
 obviously you have to take it myself 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.120
 I had to dig in all that day and 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.280
 I left a bit to see if it lasted for 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.380
 the next day yes it lasted me but 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.440
 just no longer tastes like me then 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.150
 I finished the bird the bottle and I saved it 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.569
 Well that's all I hope you like it 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.569

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.990
