so you have to correct this with a screw
key<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.979> which<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.849> easily<00:03:45.090> done<00:03:45.479> but<00:03:45.720> you

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
key here which is easily done but you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.390 
key here which is easily done but you
have<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.079> change<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.590> I'll<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:46.919> show<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
have to change it so I'll just show you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.909 
have to change it so I'll just show you
how<00:03:47.849> in<00:03:48.000> principle<00:03:48.509> works<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:49.019> waiting<00:03:49.409> like

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
how in principle works it's waiting like

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.849 
how in principle works it's waiting like

that if you're using the glyph it

you're<00:04:56.900> using<00:04:57.349> it<00:04:57.770> in<00:04:58.009> this<00:04:58.159> way<00:04:58.400> if<00:04:58.909> you're

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
you're using it in this way if you're

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.830 
you're using it in this way if you're
using<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.500> Jobi<00:05:01.370> grip<00:05:01.610> tight<00:05:01.849> you<00:05:02.419> have<00:05:02.599> to<00:05:02.720> be

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
using the Jobi grip tight you have to be

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.600 
using the Jobi grip tight you have to be
careful<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.319> which<00:05:03.560> direction<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.220> put<00:05:04.430> you

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
careful in which direction you put you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.070 
careful in which direction you put you
actually<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.210> put<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.509> backwards

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
actually have to put it backwards

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.129 
actually have to put it backwards
otherwise<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:07.280> grip<00:05:07.909> tight<00:05:08.180> protrudes

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
otherwise the grip tight protrudes

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.379 
otherwise the grip tight protrudes
behind<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.949> so<00:05:10.099> if<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.400> want<00:05:10.550> to<00:05:10.610> keep<00:05:10.879> it<00:05:11.090> on

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
behind it so if you want to keep it on

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.869 
behind it so if you want to keep it on
while<00:05:11.960> I'll<00:05:12.110> shoot<00:05:12.319> shooting<00:05:12.710> with<00:05:12.979> a<00:05:13.009> DSLR<00:05:13.250> it

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
while I'll shoot shooting with a DSLR it

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.499 
while I'll shoot shooting with a DSLR it
will<00:05:15.159> kind<00:05:16.159> of<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.550> will<00:05:16.819> hit<00:05:16.970> your<00:05:17.180> head<00:05:17.330> but

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
will kind of it will hit your head but

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.580 
will kind of it will hit your head but
if<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.780> put<00:05:18.349> on<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.680> Jobi<00:05:19.009> grip<00:05:19.190> tight

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
if you put on the Jobi grip tight

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:32.200 
if you put on the Jobi grip tight
backwards<00:05:21.590> in<00:05:22.190> 12<00:05:22.610> that<00:05:29.470> and<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.789> whole<00:05:31.940> thing

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
backwards in 12 that and the whole thing

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:42.550 
backwards in 12 that and the whole thing
mounted<00:05:32.419> on<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.440> tripod<00:05:40.750> with<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.930> Jobi<00:05:42.319> grip

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
mounted on a tripod with the Jobi grip

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.640 
mounted on a tripod with the Jobi grip
tight<00:05:42.770> adapter<00:05:43.280> turned<00:05:44.050> mounted<00:05:45.050> backwards

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
tight adapter turned mounted backwards

00:05:45.650 --> 00:06:01.170 
tight adapter turned mounted backwards
so<00:05:46.460> that<00:05:46.699> it<00:05:47.150> doesn't

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.360 

so<00:06:01.539> here<00:06:02.050> they<00:06:02.199> are<00:06:02.350> Joby<00:06:03.250> grip<00:06:03.430> tight<00:06:05.370> the

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
so here they are Joby grip tight the

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:15.150 
so here they are Joby grip tight the
glyph<00:06:07.080> and<00:06:09.030> a<00:06:10.030> hotshoe<00:06:10.860> tripod<00:06:11.860> mount<00:06:12.400> adapter
