path<00:05:31.370> of<00:05:31.490> totality<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:32.030> think<00:05:32.270> are<00:05:32.390> really<00:05:32.540> good

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
path of totality I think are really good

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.470 
path of totality I think are really good
easy<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.440> get<00:05:33.590> into<00:05:33.710> album's<00:05:34.330> path<00:05:35.330> of

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
easy to get into album's path of

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.390 
easy to get into album's path of
totality<00:05:35.570> obviously<00:05:36.260> has<00:05:36.440> that<00:05:36.680> dubstep<00:05:36.980> feel

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
totality obviously has that dubstep feel

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.000 
totality obviously has that dubstep feel
so<00:05:37.550> I<00:05:37.610> mean<00:05:37.760> it'd<00:05:37.850> be<00:05:37.940> not<00:05:38.090> into<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:39.860> is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
so I mean it'd be not into that this is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.830 
so I mean it'd be not into that this is
your<00:05:40.130> choice<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.610> thanks<00:05:41.330> for<00:05:41.390> watching<00:05:41.450> guys
