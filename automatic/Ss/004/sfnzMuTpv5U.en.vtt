not<00:02:51.870> allowed<00:02:52.200> me<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:53.310> need<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> bit<00:02:53.640> more<00:02:53.670> speed

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
not allowed me you need a bit more speed

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.509 
not allowed me you need a bit more speed
but<00:02:55.010> still<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.480> good<00:02:57.989> example<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:59.370> you

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
but still as a good example here as you

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.070 
but still as a good example here as you
can<00:02:59.549> see<00:02:59.730> there's<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.269> difference<00:03:00.570> between<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
can see there's a difference between the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.720 
can see there's a difference between the
examples<00:03:01.470> at<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.680> beginning<00:03:01.980> where<00:03:02.160> he<00:03:02.370> did

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
examples at the beginning where he did

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240 
examples at the beginning where he did
not<00:03:03.360> enough<00:03:03.630> speed<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.290> added<00:03:04.470> enough

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
not enough speed and we added enough

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.840 
not enough speed and we added enough
speed<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.650> hand<00:03:07.860> placement<00:03:08.040> as<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.580> know

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
speed and the hand placement as you know

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.100 
speed and the hand placement as you know
is<00:03:09.830> around<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.640> down<00:03:11.850> are<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.989> on

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
is around just going down are go on

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.150 
is around just going down are go on
straight<00:03:13.730> push<00:03:14.730> off<00:03:15.739> things<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:16.950> do<00:03:17.040> to

straight push off things you can do to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.540 
straight push off things you can do to
practice<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.900> get<00:03:18.900> not

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
practice this get not

have problems maybe the obstacles in

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.690 
have problems maybe the obstacles in
right<00:04:27.780> maybe<00:04:28.530> it's<00:04:28.710> too<00:04:28.890> thick<00:04:29.130> like<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.520> at

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
right maybe it's too thick like this at

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.610 
right maybe it's too thick like this at
the<00:04:29.760> beginning<00:04:29.820> game<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.660> too<00:04:30.810> small<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.350> have
