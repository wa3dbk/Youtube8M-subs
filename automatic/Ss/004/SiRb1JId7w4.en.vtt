00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.620
 this time I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 download and install apt idea and to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.430
 same time how to download and install 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.290
 Minecraft 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.369
 the first thing that you have to be an agent is 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.530
 search in google chrome browser 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 download apt and free 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.789
 I already have already done this is what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.789
 only thing I'm going to do is seek support 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.960
 here is apt and to install 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.440
 or for a little while it's good then 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.660
 people that what comes out are here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.670
 instructions to download the first 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 what you have to do is beat the bar 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.390
 of notifications that we are going to make 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.659
 if you are downloading it and when it is already 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.940
 ready they're just going to select when 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.360
 have selected it then the only thing 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.040
 what they are going to do is install but before 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.629
 of that if you see this one 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.550
 Dialog that means your phone 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.570
 is blocked by facilities that do not 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.379
 they are from place 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.380
 this is elevated here to configuration and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.080
 you're going to go to shorts that means 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.060
 that allow you to install 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.310
 apps that are out of the play are 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.369
 then the only progress after 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.039
 install the villa good then what 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.039
 you have to do is download the area 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.140
 of downloads I'm going to select 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.080
 and here I see two nutrients for 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.530
 to install or verify and install 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.590
 that for only package to install it I 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.050
 I suggest you never but never go 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.330
 to this play the verify of installing of 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.940
 lawsuit because what makes what 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 check if it's from plays tolo and what 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.920
 eliminates if you do not place it is good 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.860
 then we're going to the pack to leave only 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.180
 once I'm not going to give it as 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.729
 I have it then they will give 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:03.119
 install and then they will give you open and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.940
 ready when it has already been downloaded 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.410
 then after what you have to do 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.590
 when they have everything they are going to 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.590
 select 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 we go for a little while and here is what 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.370
 they will do is look for minecraft from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.800
 of officer 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.450

 version we are going to do 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.329
 and maybe then, here you get all 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:23.359
 the information says that it is that good 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.459

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.769
 it is not lacking, it does not freeze and it does not have 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.730
 virus then what are we going to do as 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.730
 this is the promising 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.210
 for a while it's not the only thing that's going to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.780
 to do is that it will revive us 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.780
 boyle 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.450
 and what is going to come out is that you want 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.400
 install minecraft then I edit 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.290
 I'm going to give you cancel because I already 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 I have and then it will work out that if 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.980
 you want to add the channel 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.870
 where they downloaded it that means 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.870
 that they are not going to do all this relaxation alone 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.879
 they will find it and they will download it 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.060
 well then people when they have it 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.860

 I have to reset it so 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.769

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.630
 look for those that I have is 510 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.820
