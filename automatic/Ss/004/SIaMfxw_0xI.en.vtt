00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.519
 please 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.799
 it's probably 1 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.219
 and another nursing that we are told have no notion of mental training 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.009
 of mental practice that of cultivating human qualities sometimes not even 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.560
 politically correct 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 and that's amazing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.039
 we comply, it is important to dedicate 15 years to education if we have access to them or 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.829
 vocational training 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.789
 this time nobody expects to ride a bicycle or play chess or touch the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.260
 piano without a minimum of discipline and practice 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 however for us to talk about mental training or we equate the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.300
 brain restraint is very strange 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.730
 environment the freedom 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.470
 this case is not the feeling of having some control over one's life 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.770
 souk so that control over our life is almost equivalent to the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.780
 freedom 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 control does not mean restriction 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 it sounded like mental training is nothing more than having some control over the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.320
 own mind year more in mind can your best friend be your worst enemy 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.110
 that also the idea that everything else the party will arrive with effort 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.960
 I read with a continuous exposure to her accused husband 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.380
 click on the only thing that will be perfected by itself is love and 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.020
 the charity the compassion the opening of sights the inner freedom simply 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 because that's what we want, it seems like colossal nonsense, it does not work like that 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.420
 sustain is curiously baser in relation to primary emotions and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.590
 destructive 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 the patents interesting to note that we do not need a propeller of the tour 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.030
 in both an amplifier of jealousy or a repeater of justice 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.340
 blatter or yes it seems that we need to cultivate compassion in a certain way 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.200
 and altruism on the basis of the reason of state in this environment so 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.380
 comprehension 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.369
 let's not try the potential for it, we all have it in the same way that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.750
 anyone has the potential to run a marathon but if you do not train, do not 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.789
 will get 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.089
 basically the idea is to use the potential to get a life 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.289
 optimal optimal schiavo 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.129
 perhaps that's why mental training could be called for those to whom 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.149
 they do not like that gymnastic expression for compassion to 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.539
 joaco who was able to cultivate the basic human qualities san juan and 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.889
