essentially one is that I have taken a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
essentially one is that I have taken a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
quarter twenty bolt and I've run it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
quarter twenty bolt and I've run it
through<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> existing<00:01:10.560> hole<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.189> this

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
through the existing hole of this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
through the existing hole of this
bracket<00:01:12.390> right<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.200> directly<00:01:13.680> right

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bracket right here and directly right

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.359 
bracket right here and directly right
into<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:15.060> slot<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> didn't<00:01:16.680> drill<00:01:16.979> any

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
into the slot now I didn't drill any

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.530 
into the slot now I didn't drill any
holes<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:18.590> do<00:01:19.590> anything<00:01:19.799> additional<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
holes or do anything additional to this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.679 
holes or do anything additional to this
at<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.380> simply<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.100> took<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.150> existing

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
at all I simply just took this existing

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
at all I simply just took this existing
bolt<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.680> might<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.070> three<00:01:26.460> inches

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
bolt which I think might be three inches

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
bolt which I think might be three inches
you<00:01:26.850> might<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> measure<00:01:27.500> before<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> buy

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you might want to measure before you buy

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219 
you might want to measure before you buy
one<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.610> uh<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.329> did<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.990> keep

one but uh all I did was just keep
threading<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.009> hole<00:01:32.220> right

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
threading it right to this hole right

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.109 
threading it right to this hole right
till<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> hit<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.240> slot<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.680> just

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
till I hit the slot on here and I just
cranked<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.540> hard<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.530> kind

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
cranked it really hard and it just kind

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.850 
cranked it really hard and it just kind
of<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.100> right<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> slot<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.710> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
of bit right into the slot and now it is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.109 
of bit right into the slot and now it is
nice<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.090> sturdy<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.130> give<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
little more security as far as not

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
little more security as far as not
having<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.579> worry<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:48.710> bracket<00:01:49.710> just

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
having to worry about your bracket just

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.679

kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.220> swinging<00:01:50.579> down<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.270> way<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
kind of swinging down one way or the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.950 
kind of swinging down one way or the
other<00:01:51.720> it'll<00:01:52.399> make<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.549> nice<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> sturdy<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
this would be a good addition for the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.200 
this would be a good addition for the
original<00:01:57.540> croteau<00:01:57.780> cam<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.290> well<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.939> one

and I actually mentioned that this would

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.560 
and I actually mentioned that this would
be<00:02:03.060> something<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.080 
be something to do
original<00:02:05.170> video<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.890> second<00:02:06.430> addition<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.880> did

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
original video the second addition I did

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.499 
original video the second addition I did
was<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.659> took<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:08.020> very<00:02:08.410> large<00:02:08.860> washer<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:10.479> I

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
was I took a very large washer that I

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.340 
was I took a very large washer that I
bought<00:02:10.750> at<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.710> local<00:02:11.850> hardware<00:02:12.850> store<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.750> I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
bought at a local hardware store and I

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.340 
bought at a local hardware store and I
simply<00:02:14.980> placed<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.400> between<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.720> tripod

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
simply placed it between the tripod

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.949 
simply placed it between the tripod
mount<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.190> GoPro<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.600> bracket

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
mount of the GoPro and the bracket

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.140 
mount of the GoPro and the bracket
itself<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:21.370> adds<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> little<00:02:22.000> more

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
itself and this adds a little more

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.970 
itself and this adds a little more
weight<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.690> GoPro<00:02:23.080> which<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.740> don't

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
weight to the GoPro which you don't

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.940 
weight to the GoPro which you don't
actually<00:02:24.160> need<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:25.270> originally<00:02:26.140> ran<00:02:26.800> this

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
actually need I originally ran this

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.880 
actually need I originally ran this
entire<00:02:27.250> thing<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> GoPro<00:02:28.890> mounted

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
entire thing with just the GoPro mounted

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.270 
entire thing with just the GoPro mounted
to<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> small<00:02:32.320> washer<00:02:32.740> between<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
to this with a small washer between it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.840 
to this with a small washer between it
because<00:02:33.640> there's<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:34.440> gap<00:02:35.440> issue<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:36.520> anyways

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
because there's a gap issue but anyways

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.970 
because there's a gap issue but anyways
you<00:02:37.810> don't<00:02:37.959> need<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.170> big<00:02:38.260> washer<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.830> can

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
you don't need the big washer you can

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.660 
you don't need the big washer you can
use<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.239> bracket<00:02:40.660> no<00:02:41.290> problem<00:02:41.680> but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
use this with the bracket no problem but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.100 
use this with the bracket no problem but
this<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:42.940> something<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.330> did<00:02:43.570> because<00:02:44.020> I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
this is something I did because I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.490 
this is something I did because I
believe<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.620> will<00:02:44.739> add<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.489> little<00:02:46.209> more

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
believe it will add a little more

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.210 
believe it will add a little more
stability<00:02:49.080> by<00:02:50.080> adding<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.620> little<00:02:50.890> extra

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
stability by adding that little extra

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.010 
stability by adding that little extra
amount<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.670> weight<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.239> think<00:02:52.630> that'll<00:02:52.870> help

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
amount of weight I think that'll help

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.970 
amount of weight I think that'll help
with<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.910> giving<00:02:55.120> something<00:02:55.959> for<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.620> arm

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
with just giving something for your arm

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.890 
with just giving something for your arm
to<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> little<00:02:57.640> more<00:02:57.760> feedback<00:02:58.120> against

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
to have a little more feedback against

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.340 
to have a little more feedback against
now<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.560> comes<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.950> balancing<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.780> it's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
now it comes to balancing this it's it's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.280 
now it comes to balancing this it's it's
really<00:03:02.709> pretty<00:03:03.130> easy<00:03:04.050> what<00:03:05.050> you're<00:03:05.170> gonna

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
really pretty easy what you're gonna

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.740 
really pretty easy what you're gonna
want<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.620> do<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:06.040> have<00:03:06.340> your<00:03:06.459> camera<00:03:06.940> all<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
want to do is have your camera all the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.470 
want to do is have your camera all the
way<00:03:07.870> back<00:03:08.080> on<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.799> slot<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> then<00:03:09.940> tighten<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
way back on the slot and then tighten it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.690 
way back on the slot and then tighten it
down<00:03:10.540> against<00:03:11.080> whatever<00:03:11.290> washer<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:12.100> plan<00:03:12.670> to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
down against whatever washer you plan to

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.199 
down against whatever washer you plan to
use<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.299> then<00:03:14.230> once<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.769> do<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.209> then

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
use and then once you do that then

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.660 
use and then once you do that then
you're<00:03:16.780> gonna<00:03:16.930> adjust<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.920> your<00:03:18.250> handle

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you're gonna adjust just your handle

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.819 
you're gonna adjust just your handle
here<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.090> you're<00:03:19.780> gonna<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.170> your<00:03:20.380> forward

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
here and you're gonna get your forward

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.770 
here and you're gonna get your forward
and<00:03:21.010> back

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
and back

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.370 
and back
situated<00:03:22.780> properly<00:03:23.579> now<00:03:24.579> what<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.420> do<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.959> I

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
situated properly now what I do is I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.310 
situated properly now what I do is I
loosen<00:03:27.100> it<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.760> bit<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.930> I'll

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
loosen it up just a bit and then I'll

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.800 
loosen it up just a bit and then I'll
just<00:03:29.650> kind<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:29.980> rotate<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.120> just<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:32.230> little<00:03:32.829> bit

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
just kind of rotate it just a little bit

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.509 
just kind of rotate it just a little bit
one<00:03:34.810> way<00:03:34.840> or<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> other<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> lot<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
one way or the other to a lot of the

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.400 
one way or the other to a lot of the
handle<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.910> move<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.720> now<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.200> falling

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
handle to move see now I'm falling

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.000 
handle to move see now I'm falling
forward

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
forward

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.069 
forward
so<00:03:39.670> since<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:40.030> fall<00:03:40.180> forward<00:03:40.570> I<00:03:40.660> want<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.900> move

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
so since I'm fall forward I want to move

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.870 
so since I'm fall forward I want to move
a<00:03:41.549> handle<00:03:42.549> forward<00:03:43.799> now<00:03:44.799> once<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.250> get<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
a handle forward now once I get this to

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.569 
a handle forward now once I get this to
not<00:03:46.660> fall<00:03:46.989> either<00:03:47.200> forward<00:03:47.680> or<00:03:47.769> backwards<00:03:48.280> but

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
not fall either forward or backwards but

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:57.780 
not fall either forward or backwards but
just<00:03:48.910> side<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.269> side<00:03:50.250> then<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.670> know<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:56.790> I'm

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
just side to side then I know that I'm

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.220 
just side to side then I know that I'm
doing<00:03:58.030> pretty<00:03:58.329> good<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:58.600> my<00:03:58.870> forward<00:03:59.079> and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
doing pretty good for my forward and

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.390 
doing pretty good for my forward and
backwards<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.709> can<00:03:59.890> probably<00:04:00.010> tighten

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
backwards and I can probably tighten

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.030 
backwards and I can probably tighten
down<00:04:00.519> my<00:04:00.640> handle<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.049> only<00:04:02.110> takes<00:04:02.410> tiny

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
down my handle and it only takes tiny

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.990 
down my handle and it only takes tiny
tiny<00:04:03.549> little<00:04:06.299> increments<00:04:07.299> of<00:04:07.690> movement<00:04:09.000> when

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
tiny little increments of movement when

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.810 
tiny little increments of movement when
you<00:04:10.120> go<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.390> balance<00:04:10.780> these<00:04:11.549> that's<00:04:12.549> that's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
you go to balance these that's that's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.189 
you go to balance these that's that's
pretty<00:04:13.030> good<00:04:13.239> now<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.510> can<00:04:13.720> tighten<00:04:13.959> down<00:04:14.019> my

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
pretty good now I can tighten down my

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:19.229 
pretty good now I can tighten down my
handle<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.280> I'm<00:04:15.430> holding<00:04:15.639> it<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.910> tighten

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
handle so I'm holding it just tighten

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.379 
handle so I'm holding it just tighten
that<00:04:19.269> right<00:04:19.540> down<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.260> hopefully<00:04:21.389> it's

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
that right down and hopefully it's

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.570 
that right down and hopefully it's
stayed<00:04:23.820> say<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:24.910> did<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.090> pretty<00:04:25.120> good<00:04:25.389> job<00:04:25.449> and

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
stayed say it did a pretty good job and

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.890 
stayed say it did a pretty good job and
now<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:27.970> kind<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.240> leaning<00:04:28.540> from<00:04:28.690> one

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
now it's just kind of leaning from one

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.470 
now it's just kind of leaning from one
side<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.230> other<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:29.980> now<00:04:30.160> now<00:04:31.120> because<00:04:31.360> I'm

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
side of the other so now now because I'm

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.020 
side of the other so now now because I'm
falling<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.990> my<00:04:32.020> left<00:04:32.500> what<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:32.830> want<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:33.310> is

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
falling to my left what I want to do is

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.510 
falling to my left what I want to do is
move<00:04:34.389> my<00:04:34.710> bottom<00:04:35.710> weights<00:04:35.949> here<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.900> my<00:04:38.050> right

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
move my bottom weights here to my right

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.920 
move my bottom weights here to my right
and<00:04:40.620> kind<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.740> just<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.070> back<00:04:42.280> here<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:42.930> I'm

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
and kind of just the back here so I'm

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.280 
and kind of just the back here so I'm
falling<00:04:44.410> left<00:04:44.850> I'll<00:04:45.850> take<00:04:46.030> my<00:04:46.240> weights<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.930> I

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
falling left I'll take my weights and I

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.290 
falling left I'll take my weights and I
move<00:04:47.470> them<00:04:47.590> just<00:04:48.449> slightly<00:04:49.449> left<00:04:51.120> lit<00:04:52.120> up

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
move them just slightly left lit up

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.110 
move them just slightly left lit up
right<00:04:52.540> let<00:04:53.530> go<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:56.650> now<00:04:57.100> I<00:04:57.130> have<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.639> pretty

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
right let go and now I have a pretty

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.450 
right let go and now I have a pretty
well<00:04:58.389> balanced<00:04:58.900> already<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.680> I've<00:05:00.250> already

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
well balanced already and I've already

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.730 
well balanced already and I've already
pre<00:05:00.880> figured<00:05:01.270> out<00:05:01.419> how<00:05:01.600> many<00:05:01.660> washers<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.500> need

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
pre figured out how many washers I need

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.010 
pre figured out how many washers I need
for<00:05:03.520> mine<00:05:03.729> and<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.180> is<00:05:04.389> like<00:05:04.630> I<00:05:04.720> said<00:05:04.900> the

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
for mine and this is like I said the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.100 
for mine and this is like I said the
GoPro<00:05:05.169> here<00:05:05.500> one<00:05:05.760> but<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:07.240> can<00:05:07.389> use<00:05:07.630> any

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
GoPro here one but you can use any

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.500 
GoPro here one but you can use any
assortment<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.560> washers<00:05:08.919> you<00:05:09.100> want<00:05:09.510> with

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
assortment of washers you want with

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.800 
assortment of washers you want with
yours<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:12.699> that's<00:05:12.850> just<00:05:13.090> something<00:05:13.449> to<00:05:13.630> keep

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
yours so that's just something to keep

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.650 
yours so that's just something to keep
in<00:05:13.990> mind<00:05:14.199> in<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.220> video<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.360> will<00:05:16.510> see

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
in mind in the video that you will see

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.409 
in mind in the video that you will see
me<00:05:17.020> using<00:05:17.050> this<00:05:17.650> I'm<00:05:17.919> using<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.490> in<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.910> 1080p

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419

narrow<00:05:20.370> field<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.460> view<00:05:21.520> I'm<00:05:21.820> not<00:05:21.970> really<00:05:22.120> sure

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
narrow field of view I'm not really sure

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.930 
narrow field of view I'm not really sure
which<00:05:22.660> angle<00:05:23.199> our<00:05:23.740> degree<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.370> is<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.790> can

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
which angle our degree that is you can

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.300 
which angle our degree that is you can

post that down below in the comments if

you know it offhand but if you run in

you know it offhand but if you run in

the wide point of view with the 1080p or
anything<00:05:35.050> else<00:05:35.320> you'll<00:05:36.220> actually<00:05:36.520> end<00:05:36.820> up

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
anything else you'll actually end up

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.469 
anything else you'll actually end up
getting<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.449> bracket<00:05:37.930> in<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.530> picture<00:05:39.479> so

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
getting the bracket in the picture so

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.950 
getting the bracket in the picture so
what<00:05:40.780> you'll<00:05:40.900> have<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.080> do<00:05:41.290> is<00:05:42.090> probably<00:05:43.090> move

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
what you'll have to do is probably move

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.960 
what you'll have to do is probably move
your<00:05:44.139> camera<00:05:44.410> forward<00:05:45.100> and<00:05:45.370> then<00:05:45.880> you

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
your camera forward and then you

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.810 
your camera forward and then you
probably<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.360> to<00:05:46.570> play<00:05:46.720> with<00:05:47.610> weights<00:05:48.610> and

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
probably have to play with weights and

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.360 
probably have to play with weights and
such<00:05:49.120> to<00:05:49.479> keep<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:49.990> balanced<00:05:50.530> properly<00:05:51.070> after

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
such to keep it balanced properly after

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.760 
such to keep it balanced properly after
you<00:05:51.490> do<00:05:51.639> that<00:05:51.960> it's<00:05:52.960> not<00:05:53.110> something<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.440> plan<00:05:53.740> to

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
you do that it's not something I plan to

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.149 
you do that it's not something I plan to
use<00:05:53.889> I<00:05:54.250> just<00:05:54.280> prefer<00:05:54.790> them

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
use I just prefer them

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.119 
use I just prefer them
from<00:05:55.999> my<00:05:56.119> GoPro<00:05:56.539> another<00:05:57.379> thing<00:05:57.649> when<00:05:57.949> you<00:05:58.039> go

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
from my GoPro another thing when you go

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.859 
from my GoPro another thing when you go
to<00:05:58.189> bounce<00:05:58.429> is<00:05:58.699> you<00:05:58.909> can<00:05:59.029> actually<00:05:59.209> use<00:05:59.689> your

00:05:59.859 --> 00:05:59.869 
to bounce is you can actually use your

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:00.399 
to bounce is you can actually use your
GoPro

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
GoPro

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.129 
GoPro
to<00:06:01.069> help<00:06:01.909> adjust<00:06:02.360> your<00:06:02.599> forward<00:06:02.929> and<00:06:03.020> back

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
to help adjust your forward and back

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.350 
to help adjust your forward and back
lean<00:06:03.349> as<00:06:03.499> well<00:06:03.679> by<00:06:03.919> just<00:06:04.189> kind<00:06:04.369> of<00:06:04.489> matching<00:06:05.269> it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
lean as well by just kind of matching it

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.889 
lean as well by just kind of matching it
forward<00:06:06.849> and<00:06:07.849> you<00:06:07.909> can<00:06:08.119> get<00:06:08.269> it<00:06:08.389> so<00:06:08.569> it<00:06:08.689> leans

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:08.899 
forward and you can get it so it leans

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:11.070 
forward and you can get it so it leans
forward<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.529> if<00:06:10.069> you<00:06:10.159> need<00:06:10.429> it<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.610> leaned

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
forward and if you need it to leaned

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.529 
forward and if you need it to leaned
farther<00:06:12.080> backwards<00:06:12.619> you<00:06:12.889> can<00:06:12.979> just<00:06:13.330> move<00:06:14.330> your

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
farther backwards you can just move your

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.499 
farther backwards you can just move your
GoPro<00:06:14.899> slightly<00:06:15.349> backwards<00:06:16.269> and<00:06:17.269> you'll<00:06:17.389> get

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
GoPro slightly backwards and you'll get

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.600 
GoPro slightly backwards and you'll get
a<00:06:17.569> little<00:06:17.779> bit<00:06:17.869> of<00:06:17.989> a<00:06:18.219> backwards<00:06:19.219> lean<00:06:19.399> and

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
a little bit of a backwards lean and

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.129 
a little bit of a backwards lean and
even<00:06:19.819> it<00:06:19.939> out<00:06:20.029> so<00:06:20.300> that's<00:06:20.719> another<00:06:20.929> way<00:06:21.080> to

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
even it out so that's another way to

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:21.850 
even it out so that's another way to
balance<00:06:21.409> it

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
balance it

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.399 
balance it
that's<00:06:22.489> the<00:06:22.699> chrono<00:06:23.059> cam<00:06:23.330> mini<00:06:23.629> right<00:06:24.229> now

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
that's the chrono cam mini right now

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.409 
that's the chrono cam mini right now
it's<00:06:24.800> actually<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.279> little<00:06:25.580> bottom<00:06:25.879> heavy<00:06:28.419> at

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
it's actually a little bottom heavy at

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.869
