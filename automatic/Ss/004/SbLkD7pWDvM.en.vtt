extra<00:02:18.040> click<00:02:18.959> there<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.230> your<00:02:21.100> palate<00:02:21.430> is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
extra click there it is your palate is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.900 
extra click there it is your palate is
going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> go<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.590> there<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.040> something

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
going to go just in there and something

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.699 
going to go just in there and something
which<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:25.239> quite<00:02:25.510> like<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.590> were

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
which we quite like is that if you were

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.720 
which we quite like is that if you were
to<00:02:26.950> drop<00:02:27.280> your<00:02:27.640> palate<00:02:29.040> there's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.100> hole<00:02:30.430> in

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
to drop your palate there's a hole in

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.729 
to drop your palate there's a hole in
the<00:02:30.850> bottom<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.989> just<00:02:32.230> Falls<00:02:32.470> straight

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
the bottom so just Falls straight

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.220 
the bottom so just Falls straight
through<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.880> more<00:02:34.090> fighting<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.170> that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
through no more fighting to get that

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.100 
through no more fighting to get that
palate<00:02:35.739> out<00:02:35.890> from<00:02:36.340> below<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.900> here's

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
palate out from below now here's

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.870 
palate out from below now here's
something<00:02:38.319> that's<00:02:38.410> quite<00:02:38.709> strange<00:02:39.069> when

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
something that's quite strange when

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.960 
something that's quite strange when
you've<00:02:40.060> got<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.390> breach<00:02:40.600> open<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:42.459> can<00:02:42.700> see

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
you've got the breach open you can see

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.600 
you've got the breach open you can see
straight<00:02:43.360> through<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.720> rifle<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.010> there<00:02:45.489> is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
straight through the rifle but there is

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.820 
straight through the rifle but there is
a<00:02:45.640> good<00:02:45.880> reason<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.930> incredibly

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
a good reason for that it's incredibly

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.520 
a good reason for that it's incredibly
easy<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.430> clean<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.569> can<00:02:49.810> get<00:02:50.019> at<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.350> point

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
easy to clean you can get at the point

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.460 
easy to clean you can get at the point
where<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.069> barrel<00:02:51.550> meets<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.360> breech<00:02:52.630> it's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
where the barrel meets the breech it's

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.509 
where the barrel meets the breech it's
very<00:02:53.920> very<00:02:54.400> cleverly<00:02:54.850> thought<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.450> so

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
very very cleverly thought out so

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.920 
very very cleverly thought out so
there's<00:02:57.519> never<00:02:57.730> gonna<00:02:57.910> be<00:02:58.030> any<00:02:58.180> mud<00:02:58.630> or<00:02:58.870> dirt

sport<00:05:27.860> I<00:05:28.720> like<00:05:29.720> it<00:05:29.900> a<00:05:29.990> lot<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:31.099> like<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.460> a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
sport I like it a lot and I like it a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.969 
sport I like it a lot and I like it a
lot<00:05:31.760> because<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.150> looks<00:05:32.599> like<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.470> full<00:05:33.800> on

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
lot because it looks like a full on

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.000

center<00:05:34.880> fire<00:05:35.060> rifle<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.840> actually<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.830> me<00:05:36.979> I

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
center fire rifle and actually to me I

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.570 
center fire rifle and actually to me I
find<00:05:37.760> that<00:05:37.880> quite<00:05:38.090> important<00:05:38.949> but<00:05:39.949> there<00:05:40.430> are

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
find that quite important but there are

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.879 
find that quite important but there are
a<00:05:40.610> couple<00:05:41.000> of<00:05:41.150> things<00:05:41.330> I<00:05:41.479> don't<00:05:41.630> like<00:05:41.889> the

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
a couple of things I don't like the

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.300 
a couple of things I don't like the
first<00:05:43.160> thing<00:05:44.349> is<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.590> top<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.979> this<00:05:46.099> mechanism

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
first thing is the top of this mechanism

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.469 
first thing is the top of this mechanism
here<00:05:46.970> okay<00:05:47.780> it<00:05:48.380> does<00:05:48.800> feel<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.490> little<00:05:49.729> bit

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
here okay it does feel a little bit

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.510 
here okay it does feel a little bit
rough<00:05:50.720> it's<00:05:51.169> been<00:05:51.229> beautifully<00:05:51.979> manufactured

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
rough it's been beautifully manufactured

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.240 
rough it's been beautifully manufactured
but<00:05:53.449> it<00:05:53.599> does<00:05:53.870> feel<00:05:54.169> a<00:05:54.199> little<00:05:54.349> bit<00:05:54.740> rough<00:05:55.010> and

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
but it does feel a little bit rough and
