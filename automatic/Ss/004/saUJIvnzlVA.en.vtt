00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
it's got a V input function now when I

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.539 
it's got a V input function now when I
put<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.490> V<00:00:11.910> input<00:00:12.059> mode<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:13.519> screen<00:00:14.519> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
put in a V input mode this screen just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.189

goes<00:00:15.030> drunk<00:00:17.210> let's<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.449> stupid<00:00:18.810> effect

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
goes drunk let's put that stupid effect

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.390 
goes drunk let's put that stupid effect
I<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.470> know<00:00:19.740> why<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.949> does<00:00:20.189> that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I don't know why it does that

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
picture up or walk unplug it it's just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.950 
picture up or walk unplug it it's just
as<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> same<00:01:42.429> drunk<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.539> one<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.780> same

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
as the same drunk it's the one the same

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.539 
as the same drunk it's the one the same
thing<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:45.469> does<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:45.860> well<00:01:46.399> there's

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
thing just does that well there's

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.899 
thing just does that well there's
nothing<00:01:46.759> plugged<00:01:46.909> into<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:49.520> there<00:01:49.670> why<00:01:49.850> it

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
nothing plugged into it but there why it

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.200 
nothing plugged into it but there why it
does<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:50.689> it's<00:01:51.229> just<00:01:51.880> it's<00:01:52.880> got<00:01:53.060> me

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
does that but it's just it's got me

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.949 
does that but it's just it's got me
stuck<00:01:57.399> I'm<00:01:58.399> gonna<00:01:58.549> wanna<00:01:58.789> do<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.479> on<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.750> same

stuck I'm gonna wanna do so on the same
thing<00:02:07.119> just<00:02:08.119> thought<00:02:08.390> this<00:02:08.899> stupid<00:02:10.030> store

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
thing just thought this stupid store

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.270 
thing just thought this stupid store
this<00:02:11.209> stupid<00:02:11.720> thing<00:02:11.959> by<00:02:12.319> this<00:02:12.380> behavior<00:02:12.680> just

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
this stupid thing by this behavior just

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.089 
this stupid thing by this behavior just
annoying

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
annoying

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.790 
annoying
don't<00:02:16.099> know<00:02:16.160> what<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.549> hell's<00:02:16.790> our<00:02:17.000> problem

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.240 

my<00:02:20.550> guess<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.000> some<00:02:21.380> Argus<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.530> an<00:02:22.800> in-court<00:02:23.130> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
my guess is some Argus is an in-court I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.750
