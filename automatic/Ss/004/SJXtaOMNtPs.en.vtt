00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.170
 it's everybody 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.179
 video news it's been a long time since I 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 did not do and this morning a new 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.060
 mourning everyone from the video game 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 the death of satoru iwata so the CEO of 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 nintendo creator including the wii and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.580
 of the 3ds who died so during 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.429
 this morning of a cancer of the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 pancreas I think he had since not 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.840
 seemingly time sick and so yeah 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 so the as I said that taf a shock 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 when we know that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 this guy had the idea of wii the wii and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 was one of the consoles and more sold 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 of all time that has sold more 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.770
 100 million copies and that the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.879
 guy he created dead you say wow 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.140
 What I'm c this video immediately 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.879
 after learning the news 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 that's why I still have a little 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 in shock we go I can not put to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 crying or whatever because but really 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.439
 that's a big man from the video game 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.260
 who left us today and that 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.600
 does weird there finally nintendo really 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.479
 is one of the big firms in the game 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
 video that is there from the beginning 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.259
 almost for a very long time 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 in the world of video game comparison 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.580
 microsoft who are there since what the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.780
 fifteen years 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.250
 nintendo he has since almost forty 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 years in the world of video gaming 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 even though and so yeah 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.280
 learn death like that from a chican 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.420
 tholy there it's really 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.680
 really sad what and so I 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.970
 looked a bit at the info to see if 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.009
 we spoke he does not speak at all 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 so really there the media do not care 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.290
 really video game then the last 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.890
 real appearance a little filmed but we 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.659
 do not know when 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.950
 it was the occasion of the e3 but it's 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.780
 not too much that we had relieved everything but 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.640
 good we saw that puppets or 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:13.750
 do not really see the people who stayed 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:15.370
 last e3 and yeah that's it 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.070
 it's very strange there yes I have them 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.060
 unfortunately that too because they 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 stopped producing games on it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.350
 after that this guy was still 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.030
 innovative he made the 3ds one of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.680
 most popular portable consoles too 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:40.100
 I believe that even before the Wii but good 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.650
 I know how to talk really this guy was 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.870
 very very innovative where youtube or soul 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.680
 innovative too and unfortunately I 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.600
 think the concept was too bad 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.260
 explained poorly understood by people what 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.870
 is incomprehensible on the part of people 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.210
 so here is another picture 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.680
 charismatic nintendo I'm here it is 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.970
 but CEO of Nintendo USA and suddenly I 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 do not even know who wants to resume his 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.060
 place but 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 I think of your bike I think 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.370
 probably motorcycle maybe a million 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:25.120
 or you would be very unlikely 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.560
 miyamoto because he too this man is 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.819
 a big empty big game characters 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.980
 video and from nintendo 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.069
 I believe that its creators of zelda they 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.060
 so that's just one of the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.829
 bigger licenses of any 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.939
 the story of the video game like that yeah 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.859
 after I was not ready I did not 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.989
 necessarily prepared something to say or es 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.439
 this is really about the feeling that I 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:54.209
 am talking 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:59.230
 yeah those are these two is sad 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.909
 it's just a big game when a big 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.689
 character who keeps the game alive so 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.109
 that they make you feel sad 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.109
 trial 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.650
 especially since he finally leaves after 3 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.780
 have been a lot of 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.430
 crash a little bit on nintendo because 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.720
 it's true they did not show 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.900
 really big thing 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.980
 so I agree that he does not 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.620
 did not really show 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.210
 some great stuff 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.770
 after there are some who are really hard 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.530
 with nintendo spewing them to the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.640
 mouth and without knowing that nintendo b 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.580
 Nintendo is one of the most consoles 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.010
 sold all the time there yes but there 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.140
 but one of the most portable consoles 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.410
 sold all the time the 3ds it seems 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.330
 or the small deputy of the municipalities in 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.920
 anyway these two consoles are really 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.430
 portable consoles that were very 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.430
 sold well 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.659
 and so people are spitting on 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.289
 nintendo without knowing that it's really 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.779
 people who try and unfortunately 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.360
 they tried with the wiiu 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:10.499
 it did not work so I hope their 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.999
 next console their next console 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.999
 mobile is because it will be 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:16.469
 really nintendo enix but I hope 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:20.550
 that this console is going to make sure that 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.990
 all smiles back to the podium on 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.129
 found the first and the limited area 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.039
 at the com 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.960
 but as he deserves what because 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.999
 many speak with annuities 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.099
 limit to soft and now we have 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.669
 tend to leave that out of licenses 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.460
 nintendo 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:39.169
 I think it's a shame that's 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.169
 rather a shame to abandon Nintendo 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:49.919
 that's it I do not know I see so rip 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.919
 rip satoru from there high 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:59.320
 we take good care of you and prompt and watch 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.320
 on nintendo and keep it going 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.030
 how does it work and they go out 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.660
 that daho 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.600
 a ton of euros come 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.540
 the top of these 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:16.580
 maybe with this character is a plus 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.800
 for the thirty years of here so 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.220
 that's it for this little video 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.360
 news a little I know he does not really 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.150
 in well I have that's why I 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.150
 put this video do so here is 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.160
 if you enjoyed the records and want to 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.120
 say and if you want to talk about 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.530
 debate about the video game is all 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.990
 do not hesitate in the comments 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:44.520
 no spit on nintendo if you 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.380
 that's not the time and he owes me 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 to be a big big of the video game this 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.260
 is the biggest 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.460
 So here I tell you he liked it himself 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.060
 find by next videos 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.060
 ciao
