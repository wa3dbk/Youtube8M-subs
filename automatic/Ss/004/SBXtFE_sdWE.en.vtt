you can think of your Airstream is
blowing<00:01:44.110> louder<00:01:44.679> to<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> octave<00:01:45.759> again<00:01:46.690> long

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
blowing louder to the octave again long

00:01:46.990 --> 00:02:03.210 
blowing louder to the octave again long
notes<00:01:47.319> but<00:01:47.950> loud<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.789> octave<00:01:49.149> so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.950 

you'll<00:02:03.700> just<00:02:03.880> want<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.090> keep<00:02:04.210> doing<00:02:04.420> Octus<00:02:04.810> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
you'll just want to keep doing Octus and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.960 
you'll just want to keep doing Octus and
again<00:02:05.200> take<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> long<00:02:05.980> time<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.400> was<00:02:06.610> doing<00:02:06.820> those

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
again take a long time I was doing those

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.880 
again take a long time I was doing those
rather<00:02:07.210> quickly<00:02:07.570> but<00:02:07.960> take<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.170> long<00:02:08.440> time<00:02:08.710> to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
rather quickly but take a long time to

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.350 
rather quickly but take a long time to
focus<00:02:09.100> your<00:02:09.460> embouchure<00:02:09.880> focus<00:02:10.540> your<00:02:10.690> air<00:02:10.900> do

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
focus your embouchure focus your air do

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.240 
focus your embouchure focus your air do
and<00:02:13.360> think<00:02:13.570> into<00:02:13.810> those<00:02:13.960> octaves<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.620> that's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and think into those octaves and that's

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.590 
and think into those octaves and that's
how<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.910> warmed<00:02:16.240> up

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
how you get warmed up

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.390 
how you get warmed up
that's<00:02:17.080> with<00:02:17.320> your<00:02:17.470> breath<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
that's with your breath and with the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.730 
that's with your breath and with the
horn<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.910> we<00:02:19.210> can<00:02:19.450> talk<00:02:19.600> about<00:02:19.750> fingers<00:02:20.380> how

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
horn now we can talk about fingers how

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.370 
horn now we can talk about fingers how
to<00:02:20.800> warm<00:02:21.070> them<00:02:21.340> up
