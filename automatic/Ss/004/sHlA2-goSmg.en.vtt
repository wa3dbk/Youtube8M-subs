00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.220
 I'll show you how so let you first 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.160
 ask what kind of tower is this tower 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:21.970
 which will be produced ice this booth 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.949
 which will activate this grandma 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.789
 then inside we throw either sand or 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.029
 grave 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:34.150
 I'll throw Grave we get like this at 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:42.500
 many of us can fly many gifts yes 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:44.600
 she will be with us 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.470
 I warn you I did not steal it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.900
 stole looked from a friend if something is not 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.200
 write in the comments that he stole 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.050
 there is something that I immediately warn 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.120
 what I will show in detail how to eat it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.409
 to build 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:12.490
 take absolutely any block 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:18.020
 I'll take this one 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.240
 you can do any height here 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:26.119
 means necessary to set aside that have 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.009
 you will not work understand any 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.579
 heights but it seems to me if you will 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.139
 understand 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.139
 higher the better 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.759
 i am too 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 too high will not raise because 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:57.720
 that I tell you his current count 4 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:01.560
 cube down 1 2 3 4 and set to 4 now 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.350
 get down and build that kind of house 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 well booth to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.390
 activated we have this big tower 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:30.120
 put 3 for 3 and break 3 cubes bottom 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:32.100
 two three and close here this is not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.880
 it is necessary to close here so it is not necessary 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.610
 close later it will be late 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.709
 say you will work and then not 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.709
 you can throw gravel or sand anywhere 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 this you will sing falls fall on 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.420
 that in the summer to break here this land 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:04.940
 so that he does not interfere with us to leave 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:04.940
 You know, ask for a card 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:22.480
 now let's fix everything we don't put sand here 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.209
 and on it a map if we have an engrave or 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.140
 the sand will fall here we have a defender card 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.799
 due to this, he will work with us 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:04:00.660
 now we rise and drip a hole 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:04:03.849
 before that hole, that's where we put the demigod 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.060
 everything is almost ready to come to us like 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:12.940
 we will need a nameplate and a nameplate 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:17.769
 stand on a cactus and with a sign like 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:21.489
 we will be a chain and a nameplate on a nameplate 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.830
 We will put it to work here 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.220
 all built now can be closed 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:36.570
 it is not to be seen 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:45.090
 pit and now put here gravel and 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:48.930
 we rise to the top we set like this 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:53.740
 release and we'll have again 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:58.270
 Well, in short, put a sign here and 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.639
 nameplate like that high here how many 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.030
 cubes left down and so much for 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:12.810
 put up here you need to put 1234 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:17.840
 so that one sticks out take the cows 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:22.770
 yes you need to put at least 50 cows 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.450
 so they gave flew away now 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.450
 everything will be done java now its 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.450
 demonstrate 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.610
 but if so how would it be if you are a miracle 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.729
 will fall 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.789
 your cow will be pushed very far 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.189
 here so you fly here it is possible 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:56.169
 count as a catapult but everything probably 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:59.289
 enough for him candy I shove to about 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:09.569
 tom like people videos from me so they 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:13.389
 flew it enough now we go down and 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:17.339
 we drop the engraving we get here 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.339
 here comes the cows and 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:24.279
 not all of our mane disappears 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.539
 I wonder where he disappears 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:30.069
 he himself still does not understand 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:34.469
 like put likes subscribe 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.469
