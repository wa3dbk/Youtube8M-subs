00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.200 

hello<00:00:01.319> guys<00:00:01.469> calc<00:00:01.920> layover<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.399> today<00:00:03.179> I

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hello guys calc layover here today I

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.970 
hello guys calc layover here today I
want<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.540> show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.750> guys<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.110> new<00:00:04.140> module<00:00:04.589> I

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
want to show you guys a new module I

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.820 
want to show you guys a new module I
added<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.430> mff<00:00:05.970> s<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.500> Aerie

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
added to mff s and that is the Aerie

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.009 
added to mff s and that is the Aerie
module<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> actually<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> pretty

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
module and this is actually a pretty

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.830 
module and this is actually a pretty
cool<00:00:10.440> module<00:00:11.099> because<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.880> allows<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
cool module because it allows you to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.839 
cool module because it allows you to
repeat<00:00:13.290> your<00:00:13.860> force<00:00:14.160> field<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> specific

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
repeat your force field in a specific

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.210 
repeat your force field in a specific
direction<00:00:15.350> for<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> specific<00:00:16.650> amount<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> time

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
direction for a specific amount of time

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.400 
direction for a specific amount of time
so<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> pattern<00:00:19.080> builder

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
so it's kind of like a pattern builder

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.830 
so it's kind of like a pattern builder
where<00:00:19.619> allows<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.789> know<00:00:20.820> extend<00:00:21.359> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
where allows you to you know extend this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.490 
where allows you to you know extend this
force<00:00:22.350> field<00:00:22.970> pattern<00:00:23.970> towards<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> specific

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
force field pattern towards the specific

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890 
force field pattern towards the specific
direction<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.449> let<00:00:27.449> me<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.750> demonstrate

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
direction so let me just demonstrate

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.830 
direction so let me just demonstrate
this<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> very<00:00:30.060> very

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
this to you here we have a very very

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.389 
this to you here we have a very very
average<00:00:32.059> cylinder<00:00:33.170> force<00:00:34.170> field<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.280> can

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
average cylinder force field as you can

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.590 
average cylinder force field as you can
see<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.030> nothing<00:00:36.600> too<00:00:36.750> special<00:00:37.579> now

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
see here it's nothing too special now

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.150 
see here it's nothing too special now
let's<00:00:39.600> put<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:41.370> error<00:00:41.700> module<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.160> bam

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
let's put a an error module in and bam

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
let's put a an error module in and bam
the<00:00:44.700> cylinder<00:00:45.090> module<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> duplicated<00:00:46.379> here

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the cylinder module is duplicated here

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
the cylinder module is duplicated here
in<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.190> pattern<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.170> reason<00:00:49.440> why<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in this pattern and the reason why I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.170 
in this pattern and the reason why I
goes<00:00:49.800> towards<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> side<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.000> put

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
goes towards this side is because I put

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.029 
goes towards this side is because I put
it<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> front<00:00:51.899> slot<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it in the front slot so this is the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
it in the front slot so this is the
front<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.390> move<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> left<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
front and if I move it to the left it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.950 
front and if I move it to the left it
will<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> side<00:00:56.489> you'll<00:00:57.360> move<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> write

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
will go to the side you'll move to write

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
will go to the side you'll move to write
it<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:59.300> and<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.420> move<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
it will go that side and I move to the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.830 
it will go that side and I move to the
back<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.410> will<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:03.629> also

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
back it will go that side and it also

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.570 
back it will go that side and it also
works<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.500> i<00:01:04.589> put<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.070> down<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.489> i'm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
works if i put it up or down so i'm

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.429 
works if i put it up or down so i'm
gonna<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.270> go<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:07.080> we'll<00:01:07.290> make

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
gonna put it down or go well we'll make

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
gonna put it down or go well we'll make
it<00:01:07.560> taller<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.000> it'll<00:01:09.240> make<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it taller and put it up it'll make it a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.830 
it taller and put it up it'll make it a
you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.990> higher<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.939> this<00:01:11.939> error<00:01:12.270> module

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you know higher and this error module

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
you know higher and this error module
works<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.409> types<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.799> module<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.640> types

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
works with all types of module all types

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.020 
works with all types of module all types
of<00:01:15.270> projection<00:01:16.080> modes<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.920> example<00:01:17.400> let's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of projection modes for example let's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
of projection modes for example let's
say<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:20.659> want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> sphere<00:01:22.500> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
say we want to do want to do a sphere so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
say we want to do want to do a sphere so
let's<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.030> sphere<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.619> see

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
let's put sphere in and as you can see

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
let's put sphere in and as you can see
here<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> makes<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.930> looks<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:29.030> looks<00:01:30.030> like

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
here it makes a it looks like looks like

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
here it makes a it looks like looks like
I<00:01:30.630> looks<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> those<00:01:31.770> weight<00:01:32.280> lifting

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I looks like one of those weight lifting

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.520 
I looks like one of those weight lifting
things<00:01:34.430> here<00:01:35.430> anyway<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> use

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
things here anyway you can see the use

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.980 
things here anyway you can see the use
of<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> coolest<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
of this now the coolest thing is if I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
of this now the coolest thing is if I
put<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.500> modules<00:01:41.180> more<00:01:42.180> area<00:01:42.509> modules<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.520> it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
put more modules more area modules on it

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
put more modules more area modules on it
would<00:01:44.700> stack<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> higher<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.750> higher

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
would stack and we get higher and higher

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
would stack and we get higher and higher
so<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.070> amount<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> error<00:01:48.090> modules<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.689> put

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so the amount of error modules you put

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.889 
so the amount of error modules you put
in<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> amount<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> repeat<00:01:50.070> repeat<00:01:50.899> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
in is the amount of repeat repeat it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.800 
in is the amount of repeat repeat it
creates<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.009> pattern<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.659> is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
creates for this pattern so this is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
creates for this pattern so this is
pretty<00:01:54.990> useful<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.340> build<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
pretty useful if you want to build like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
pretty useful if you want to build like
a<00:01:57.060> building<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.750> has<00:01:57.899> long<00:01:58.250> repetitive

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a building that has long repetitive

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.899 
a building that has long repetitive
features<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.659> example<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.909> let's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
features to it for example we have let's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.030 
features to it for example we have let's
say<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> build<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.570> castle<00:02:03.750> wall<00:02:04.079> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
say we want to build a castle wall so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.020 
say we want to build a castle wall so
let<00:02:05.219> me<00:02:05.250> take<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.759> custom<00:02:06.210> mode

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
let me take a custom mode

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.900 
let me take a custom mode
and<00:02:07.470> this<00:02:08.470> looks<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.979> good<00:02:09.130> template<00:02:09.550> for

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
and this looks like a good template for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.840 
and this looks like a good template for
a<00:02:09.940> castle<00:02:10.630> wall<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.459> let<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.700> write

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
a castle wall that is so let me write

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
a castle wall that is so let me write
click<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.540> right<00:02:14.260> click<00:02:14.380> top<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.010> then

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
click this and right click top and then

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.660 
click this and right click top and then
say<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> field<00:02:16.720> structure<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
say the field structure and put the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.930 
say the field structure and put the
custom<00:02:19.060> mode<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:21.910> see

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
custom mode in as you and as you can see

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.020 
custom mode in as you and as you can see
here<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.660> just<00:02:22.720> makes<00:02:23.020> us<00:02:23.140> one<00:02:23.350> low<00:02:23.880> section<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
here it just makes us one low section of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.830 
here it just makes us one low section of
the<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.890> castle<00:02:27.250> wall<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.610> if<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.450> put

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the of the castle wall and if we put

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.490 
the of the castle wall and if we put
some<00:02:29.230> error<00:02:29.530> modules<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:31.360> will<00:02:31.569> repeat

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
some error modules in it will repeat

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.309 
some error modules in it will repeat
this<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.739> pattern<00:02:33.430> couple<00:02:34.030> times<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:35.050> let<00:02:35.260> me

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
this a pattern couple times and let me

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.390 
this a pattern couple times and let me
just<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.709> what<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.010> looks<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.280> with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
just see what it looks like with

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.140 
just see what it looks like with
camouflage<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:39.340> will<00:02:39.489> only<00:02:39.580> camouflage

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
camouflage it will only camouflage

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.870 
camouflage it will only camouflage
actually<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.630> first<00:02:40.660> part<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.519> rest<00:02:42.550> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
actually the first part but the rest of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.300 
actually the first part but the rest of
it<00:02:43.000> will<00:02:43.120> actually<00:02:43.300> be<00:02:43.780> built<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.950> use<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
it will actually be built if you use the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.920 
it will actually be built if you use the
field<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:47.040> field<00:02:48.040> stabilizer<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:49.269> few

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
field a field stabilizer a few

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.280 
field a field stabilizer a few
stabilizer<00:02:50.350> yeah<00:02:50.709> on<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:53.580> repeated

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
stabilizer yeah on to this repeated

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.340 
stabilizer yeah on to this repeated
module<00:02:56.790> repeated<00:02:57.790> force<00:02:58.030> field<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.600> so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
module repeated force field that is so

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.750 
module repeated force field that is so
it's<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.800> pretty<00:02:59.920> cool<00:03:00.220> feature<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.580> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
it's a pretty cool feature that you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's a pretty cool feature that you
could<00:03:00.880> use<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.769> let's<00:03:02.769> say<00:03:02.920> builds<00:03:03.459> or

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
could use for your let's say builds or

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.309 
could use for your let's say builds or
if<00:03:03.819> you're<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.090> build<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.450> huge

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
if you're going to build like a huge

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.330 
if you're going to build like a huge
castle<00:03:05.620> or<00:03:06.390> some<00:03:07.390> kind<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.569> wall<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
castle or some kind of wall just like a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.000 
castle or some kind of wall just like a
pretty<00:03:09.670> cool<00:03:09.850> turret<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:11.079> hope<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.920> guys

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
pretty cool turret and I hope you guys

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.449 
pretty cool turret and I hope you guys
will<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.459> feature<00:03:12.700> oh<00:03:14.190> yeah<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.430> more

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
will like this feature oh yeah one more

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.250 
will like this feature oh yeah one more
thing<00:03:15.610> before<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.090> go<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.230> can<00:03:17.320> see<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.709> d

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
thing before I go as you can see here d

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280 
thing before I go as you can see here d
I<00:03:20.260> fixed<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.310> problem<00:03:21.489> with<00:03:21.820> stone<00:03:22.660> slabs<00:03:23.019> not

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
I fixed a problem with stone slabs not

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.199 
I fixed a problem with stone slabs not
working<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> camouflage<00:03:24.940> block

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
working with a camouflage block

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.600 
working with a camouflage block
camouflage<00:03:26.079> module<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.739> now<00:03:27.010> it's<00:03:27.250> working

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
camouflage module and now it's working

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.360 
camouflage module and now it's working
pretty<00:03:27.790> well<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.500> also<00:03:29.500> added<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:30.070> lot<00:03:30.310> of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
pretty well I also added a lot of

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.150 
pretty well I also added a lot of
different<00:03:30.519> types<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.299> blocks<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.500> be<00:03:32.620> able<00:03:32.890> to

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
different types of blocks to be able to

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.810 
different types of blocks to be able to
be<00:03:33.250> camouflage<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:35.310> actually<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.370> think<00:03:36.459> most

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
be camouflage and actually I think most

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.240 
be camouflage and actually I think most
vanilla<00:03:37.269> box<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.750> be<00:03:37.780> camera<00:03:38.109> flash<00:03:38.290> now<00:03:38.530> even

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
vanilla box can be camera flash now even

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.920 
vanilla box can be camera flash now even
if<00:03:39.370> they're<00:03:39.519> like<00:03:39.670> half<00:03:39.880> slabs<00:03:40.239> or<00:03:40.510> if<00:03:40.750> they're

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
if they're like half slabs or if they're

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.509 
if they're like half slabs or if they're
like<00:03:41.140> let's<00:03:41.920> see<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.769> enchantment<00:03:45.489> table

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
like let's see the enchantment table

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.569 
like let's see the enchantment table
that<00:03:46.510> should<00:03:46.660> also<00:03:46.750> work<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:47.769> hope<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.549> guys

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
that should also work so I hope you guys

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.000 
that should also work so I hope you guys
will<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.060> all<00:03:49.480> these<00:03:49.660> new<00:03:49.989> changes<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.709> an

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
will like all these new changes to an

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.790 
will like all these new changes to an
ffs<00:03:51.959> 3.5<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.350> have<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.340> nice<00:03:54.579> day
