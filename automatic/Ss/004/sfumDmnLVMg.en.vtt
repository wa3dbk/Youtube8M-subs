00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.160
 h 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.800
 would be missing from the perpetrators 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.369
 nevertheless we see below for example the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 breda was allowed to renew it, but I must say that this is a minor one 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.619
 party 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 the technical changes are actually much more important 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.499
 for the series immediately started a commercial sleat the 110 hp engine that 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.190
 originally from benenson 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.149
 from which there come six liter engine just gives a complete made 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.180
 with turbo and that malloten area 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.720
 slightly more power but above all a considerably higher torque and that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200
 not only causes high driving pleasure and better performance 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.350
 but is the basis for resto skill 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.030
 lower fuel consumption 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 Job 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.360
 and how do these different engines relate to each other 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.270
 let's take a look at the old one point six sixteen valve 3 no longer available 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.900
 is could enter in the afternoon 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.260
 then his engine had a torque of 151 new then meters 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.510
 at and hamburg speed 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.220
 this engine has a torque of 190 now it means that is almost a switch 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.810
 value moreover at a lower speed lower speed easily accelerate 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.440
 driving away the damper from low speeds automatically means again 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.180
 lower fuel consumption 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 we see that again the CEO employs that has dropped from 158 grams per 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.090
 kilometer after 119 grams per kilometer that saves 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 firstly, literally and figuratively, a sip on a drink and moreover 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 it also saves the additional land with that 119 grams 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 the media immediately falls into this series as the motor movie is called 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 officially in the category for 20 percent 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 weeks tax benefit and bpm benefit is not back 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.490
 but the lakers mens 2 emissions you have a positive influence again 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.910
 the stem 2 taxes 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.410
 must be paid on top of the DTM 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.120
 and those two taxes are again so favorable despite this new powerful one 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.029
 engine 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.419
 the prices of the name are about the same 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:17.489
 the figures are of course very nice but it is all about 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.609
 what consumes far too little practices what settled with the ferry 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.629
 then also predicts an average consumption of hemp 18 come nine but we are 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.729
 addressed all brands used to this kind of beneficial where it is in practice 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.229
 not be met 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.449
 that there is more than one point wpc in this coupÃ© version but it makes up for the 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.219
 five so not so much off 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.079
 achieves an average of ports in practice and at 14 and with that is 115 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.289
 HP only a two-liter four-cylinder turbo engine 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.959
 almost at the same time 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.459
 For example, as with a commercial is not the case 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.419
 yunoo yen kia and the one liter three-cylinder turbo engine 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.729
 even though the difference on paper is often greater between these competing engines
