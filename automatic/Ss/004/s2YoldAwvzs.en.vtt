00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the first stage of answering this

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.740 
the first stage of answering this
question<00:00:49.550> was<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.059> look<00:00:50.329> at<00:00:50.480> our<00:00:50.600> own

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
question was to look at our own

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.020 
question was to look at our own
experiences<00:00:51.670> brainstorming<00:00:52.670> was<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.910> method

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
experiences brainstorming was the method

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.220 
experiences brainstorming was the method
we<00:00:53.239> used<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.829> brainstorming<00:00:55.430> session

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
we used the brainstorming session

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.360 
we used the brainstorming session
identified<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.379> main<00:00:57.559> problems<00:00:58.040> that<00:00:58.250> we

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
identified the main problems that we

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.959 
identified the main problems that we
encountered<00:00:58.930> there<00:00:59.930> were<00:00:59.989> two<00:01:00.170> main<00:01:00.350> problems

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
encountered there were two main problems

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.700 
encountered there were two main problems
one<00:01:01.969> was<00:01:02.180> following<00:01:02.600> complicated<00:01:03.289> recipes

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
one was following complicated recipes

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.580 
one was following complicated recipes
with<00:01:04.040> many<00:01:04.309> ingredients<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.560> second<00:01:06.950> was

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
with many ingredients the second was

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.320 
with many ingredients the second was
given<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.680> user<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.070> ability<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:11.000> leave<00:01:11.180> the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
given the user the ability to leave the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.070 
given the user the ability to leave the
kitchen<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:11.990> cooker<00:01:12.920> on<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.930> do<00:01:15.049> other

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
kitchen and the cooker on to do other

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.889 
kitchen and the cooker on to do other
activities<00:01:15.759> without<00:01:16.759> any<00:01:17.119> any<00:01:17.360> risk<00:01:17.659> of

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
activities without any any risk of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.389 
activities without any any risk of
burning<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.350> food<00:01:18.560> or<00:01:18.830> pans<00:01:19.700> boiling<00:01:20.210> over<00:01:21.399> to

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
burning the food or pans boiling over to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.510 
burning the food or pans boiling over to
solve<00:01:22.670> these<00:01:22.820> two<00:01:23.060> problems<00:01:23.890> we<00:01:24.890> decided<00:01:25.399> to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
solve these two problems we decided to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.029 
solve these two problems we decided to
create<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.850> cooker<00:01:26.289> which<00:01:27.289> would<00:01:27.470> function<00:01:27.800> in

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
create a cooker which would function in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.779 
create a cooker which would function in
an<00:01:28.220> ambient<00:01:28.700> intelligent<00:01:29.360> environment<00:01:30.789> the

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
an ambient intelligent environment the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.850 
an ambient intelligent environment the
next<00:01:32.119> aim<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.450> state<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.020> was<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.409> find<00:01:33.619> other

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
next aim in state one was to find other

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.919 
next aim in state one was to find other
common<00:01:34.190> problems<00:01:34.550> in<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.819> kitchen<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.600> also

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
common problems in the kitchen and also

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.419 
common problems in the kitchen and also
find<00:01:36.200> out<00:01:36.380> what<00:01:36.560> other<00:01:36.770> people<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
find out what other people use the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.330 
find out what other people use the
kitchen<00:01:37.610> for<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:39.229> designed<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.740> questionnaire

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
kitchen for we designed a questionnaire

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
the cooker which would be used when the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.480 
the cooker which would be used when the
cooker<00:04:44.510> is<00:04:44.630> not<00:04:44.780> in<00:04:44.900> use<00:04:45.080> or<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.980> after<00:04:46.160> use

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
when the orb is cooling down we also

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.470 
when the orb is cooling down we also
wanted<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.700> ensure<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.060> safety<00:04:50.270> of<00:04:50.390> children

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480

wanted to ensure the safety of children
in<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.020> kitchen<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:51.980> we<00:04:52.010> came<00:04:52.250> up<00:04:52.340> with

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
in the kitchen so we came up with

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.850 
in the kitchen so we came up with
additional<00:04:53.240> protection<00:04:53.810> on<00:04:54.020> their<00:04:54.320> oven<00:04:54.650> door

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
additional protection on their oven door

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.180 
additional protection on their oven door
so<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.670> would<00:04:55.790> not<00:04:55.910> get<00:04:56.090> hot<00:04:56.620> he<00:04:57.620> also<00:04:57.770> came<00:04:58.040> up

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
so it would not get hot he also came up

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.580 
so it would not get hot he also came up
with<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> child<00:04:58.730> lock<00:04:59.030> idea<00:04:59.510> which<00:04:59.930> which<00:05:00.380> would

with a child lock idea which which would

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.470 
with a child lock idea which which would
ensure<00:05:00.920> children<00:05:01.370> cannot<00:05:01.880> open<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.390> oven

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480
