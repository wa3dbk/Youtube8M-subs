now the the place that I kind of feel

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
now the the place that I kind of feel
like<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.909> gun<00:01:33.119> shines<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> fact<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
like this gun shines is the fact that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.480

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
recoil on basically all the guns that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.410 
recoil on basically all the guns that
have<00:02:20.280> tried<00:02:20.520> out<00:02:20.670> again<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.210> only<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
have tried out again this is only the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.330 
have tried out again this is only the
beta<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.350> know<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> graphics<00:02:23.010> could<00:02:23.220> look

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
beta so you know the graphics could look

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.710 
beta so you know the graphics could look
a<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:24.000> bit<00:02:24.210> different<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.600> this

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
a little bit different you know this

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.260 
a little bit different you know this
game<00:02:24.870> isn't<00:02:25.080> fully<00:02:25.470> finalized<00:02:26.130> again<00:02:26.910> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
know there's gonna be uh probably quite

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.640 
know there's gonna be uh probably quite
a<00:02:29.190> bit<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.520> changes<00:02:29.910> overall<00:02:30.420> after<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.440> time

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
a bit of changes overall after the time

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.840 
a bit of changes overall after the time
