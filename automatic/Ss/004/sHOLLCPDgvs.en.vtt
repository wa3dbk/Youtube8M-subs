 Remove the language you want the utility 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.960
 of this compared by the application of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.970
 the energy writings of quite 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.160
 the editor admits that there are 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.890
 portable devices is that the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 pdf files you can move them in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 the computer to another of the device to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.769
 another can underline can you write 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.240
 comments and can move them to a time 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.610
 windows to mac and vice versa 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.480
 I want to teach them how to do it has to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.480
 enter this site 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.530
 heretical points hete 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.199
 and this is they have to go to the section 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.960
 where ever appears and click 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.630
 there and then choose the language or because 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 you want to find and download the book 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070
 in this case we go to spanish 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.410
 ellen white raitings boots if you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410
 they want a book 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.440
 and we are going to give him for example the way to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.400
 Christ 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 I think that in Spanish maybe 5% is not 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.030
 in pdf format but almost everything is in 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.250
 pdf format 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.710
 the idea of ​​the way to Christ for example 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.140
 and here it appears on the list of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.900
 pdf options 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.200
 then they can go find and for what 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.420
 they serve the rest but in this case pdf 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.360
 then another tab or the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.340
 same tab 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.590
 the image that you are seeing 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.079
 below is loading the pdf book 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.420
 that is loaded you can read it 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.040
 here but then this is simply going to be 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.410
 on-line 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.320
 and what I recommend is that what 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.650
 download to your computer download 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.650
 here 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.200
 eye is not yet engraved in his 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.290
 computer was downloaded in the suck efe 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.390
 but it's in a volatile memory is 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 say not permanent to save the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.190
 file have to go here they go to the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.950
 corner of here then 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.190
 It has he 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.440
 if it appears like this and it hits the disk 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.360
 then they save the file not 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.310
 they want to save it in this case I am a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.310
 mark or save the text 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 or they can go to the main menu of the 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.470
 browser and they can give you burn pages 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.530
 as 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.600
 and to you it is the same process in case 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.280
 that does not appear stake 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.209
 save and here they saved it 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.950
 then those who have more can and do 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.410
 I recommend that you download an application 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.260
 which is called skin 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.600
 be from here but they can go to google 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.600
 who can download skype 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.200
 and already download in this application is 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.270
 much better than the acrobat reader not 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.610
 only stop is available to walk 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.810
 in this case I'm going to open it for example 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.430
 in the applications who is the book 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.980
 I have some options set 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.340
 there where one can write notes by 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 example 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.870
 hello this is an entrance 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.519
 the note is showing up there you can 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.519
 underline 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.959
 You can underline that appear there you 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.959
 you can search 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.020
 something in your notes sometimes I write very 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.510
 important or key about a certain subject 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.400
 even share with a certain person and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 I write it in the comments can 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.360
 Filter the comments by color by 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.989
 page 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.720
 by type of note that you are here 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.570
 then they can be classified and can 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.609
 also be in the book and can 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.919
 record this file that would be another 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.400
 tutorial has to look there and read a 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.810
 bit 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.870
 but this is one of the options 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.480
 in the case that they also have in mac or 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.290
 in windows you will have to download 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.900
 in acrobat reader x which is the last 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.650
 version they download this in their 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.650
 computer 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.990
 and here they downloaded it install it and 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.120
 then the advantage of this reader x is 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.100
 that you have the option can also 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.960
 upload comments and underlined though you 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 I'm missing certain functions I'm going to open it 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.650
 is in the version to walk the reader 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.650
 because they are going to see here also 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.580
 can search in the text can 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.650
 write comments too 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.710
 for example that is available for 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.979
 windows if you want to underline no 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.979
 have write comments for example 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.979
 boyacá 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.400
 can you live here 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.760
 it is a pity 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.990
 the comment is there but closes it 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.450
 a test can also underline 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.310
 although they do not have to whom the adobe does not 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.900
 They have different color options 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:52.490
 to underline can also look like this 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.780
 like in skin for bad and can filter 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.800
 also what kind of comments can 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.800
 see in this column 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:07.230
 to save for you do not finish 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.390

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.270
 copy underline paste and make your own 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.090
 collection without depending on first a 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:27.190
 device to be able 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:30.340

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:34.560
 small tutorial contains things there that
