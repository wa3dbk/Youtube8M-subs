00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
body that the patient wishes here is the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880 
body that the patient wishes here is the
fat<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.810> fat<00:01:08.840> has<00:01:09.290> three<00:01:09.680> different

layers the top layer is oily then there

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.460 
layers the top layer is oily then there
is<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.430> adult<00:01:13.670> fat<00:01:13.940> cells<00:01:14.270> which<00:01:15.170> give<00:01:15.380> you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
is the adult fat cells which give you

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.469 
is the adult fat cells which give you
the<00:01:15.620> volume<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:16.490> right<00:01:16.760> on<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.150> bottom

the volume and then right on the bottom

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.960 
the volume and then right on the bottom
is<00:01:17.690> where<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.770> stem<00:01:19.190> cells<00:01:19.430> generally

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
is where the stem cells generally

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.840 
is where the stem cells generally
concentrates<00:01:20.690> once<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:21.560> have<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> fat<00:01:22.100> we

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
concentrates once we have the fat we

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.270 
concentrates once we have the fat we
separate<00:01:23.750> out<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.049> stem<00:01:24.290> cells<00:01:24.530> from<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.130> fat

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
separate out the stem cells from the fat

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.969 
separate out the stem cells from the fat
and<00:01:25.670> we<00:01:25.960> concentrate<00:01:26.960> those<00:01:27.080> stem<00:01:27.440> cells<00:01:27.470> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
and we concentrate those stem cells and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.640 
and we concentrate those stem cells and
we<00:01:28.850> prepare<00:01:29.240> them<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.540> be<00:01:29.659> injected<00:01:30.200> back<00:01:30.350> in

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
we prepare them to be injected back in

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.700 
we prepare them to be injected back in
step<00:01:31.430> two<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:31.909> take<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.750> stem<00:01:33.110> cells<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.590> we

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
step two we take the stem cells and we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.859 
step two we take the stem cells and we
inject<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.340> with<00:01:34.850> some<00:01:35.060> fat<00:01:35.330> into<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
inject it with some fat into the

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.700 
inject it with some fat into the
affected<00:01:36.350> areas<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:37.060> restore<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.240> tissues

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
affected areas to restore the tissues

the<00:01:39.710> stem<00:01:39.920> cell<00:01:40.159> procedure<00:01:40.880> will<00:01:41.030> cause<00:01:41.270> some

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
the stem cell procedure will cause some

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.700 
the stem cell procedure will cause some
inflammation<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.270> some<00:01:44.270> swelling<00:01:44.570> both<00:01:45.470> in

inflammation and some swelling both in
the<00:01:45.830> area<00:01:46.130> where<00:01:46.340> we<00:01:46.460> take<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.240> fat<00:01:47.450> out<00:01:47.479> and
