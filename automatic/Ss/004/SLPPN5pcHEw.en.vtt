like titanium double wall insulated mugs

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.790 
like titanium double wall insulated mugs
those<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.760> wait<00:01:19.910> four<00:01:20.270> or<00:01:20.480> five<00:01:20.720> ounces<00:01:21.200> but

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
those can wait four or five ounces but

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.770 
those can wait four or five ounces but
what<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.070> found<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.580> better<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.480> free

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
what I found is better is the free

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.530 
what I found is better is the free
styrofoam<00:01:24.590> cup<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.400> can<00:01:25.550> get<00:01:25.670> these<00:01:25.820> from

work<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.350> can<00:01:27.500> get<00:01:27.590> these<00:01:28.240> from<00:01:29.240> gas<00:01:29.540> station

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
work you can get these from gas station

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.900 
work you can get these from gas station
I<00:01:30.110> stole<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.620> one<00:01:30.860> from<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.190> hotel<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.850> was

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
I stole this one from a hotel that I was

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.670 
I stole this one from a hotel that I was
staying<00:01:32.000> at<00:01:32.330> this<00:01:32.450> weekend<00:01:32.870> and<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.500> through

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
staying at this weekend and the through

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.590 
staying at this weekend and the through
the<00:01:33.800> way<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:36.040> 0.1<00:01:37.040> ounces<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.670> lot<00:01:38.180> less<00:01:38.390> than

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
the way is 0.1 ounces a lot less than

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.240 
the way is 0.1 ounces a lot less than
four<00:01:38.900> or<00:01:38.930> five<00:01:39.170> ounces<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.220> again<00:01:40.460> free<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
four or five ounces so again free and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.860 
four or five ounces so again free and
probably<00:01:43.250> works<00:01:43.460> left<00:01:43.730> better<00:01:43.970> than<00:01:44.240> the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
probably works left better than the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.930 
probably works left better than the
titanium<00:01:45.530> double<00:01:45.860> wall<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:45.980> lot<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.370> ways<00:01:46.490> it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
titanium double wall a lot of ways it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.140 
titanium double wall a lot of ways it
can't<00:01:47.180> be<00:01:47.270> pressed<00:01:47.860> dryer<00:01:48.860> lint<00:01:49.160> it's<00:01:49.790> free

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
can't be pressed dryer lint it's free

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.110 
can't be pressed dryer lint it's free
and<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:51.110> makes<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.470> great<00:01:51.710> fire<00:01:51.980> starter<00:01:52.490> the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
and it makes a great fire starter the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.420 
and it makes a great fire starter the
best<00:01:53.330> practice<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.260> probably<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.920> drip<00:01:55.250> some

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
best practice is probably to drip some

done<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.330> probably<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:54.050> know<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> dozen<00:04:55.010> times

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
done it probably I know a dozen times

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.120 
done it probably I know a dozen times
and<00:04:55.550> never<00:04:56.000> had<00:04:56.180> one<00:04:56.389> of<00:04:56.479> these<00:04:56.600> fail<00:04:57.130> water

bottles<00:04:58.639> ditch<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.930> Nalgene<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.680> just<00:05:01.430> use

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
bottles ditch the Nalgene and just use

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.030 
bottles ditch the Nalgene and just use
an<00:05:01.940> Aquafina<00:05:02.450> one<00:05:02.780> liter<00:05:02.960> bottle<00:05:03.050> these

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
an Aquafina one liter bottle these

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.950 
an Aquafina one liter bottle these
things<00:05:04.310> are<00:05:04.460> great<00:05:04.550> you're<00:05:05.479> probably<00:05:05.750> going

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
things are great you're probably going

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.629 
things are great you're probably going
to<00:05:06.020> buy<00:05:06.169> bottled<00:05:06.710> water<00:05:06.770> at<00:05:07.130> some<00:05:07.370> point

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
to buy bottled water at some point

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.790 
to buy bottled water at some point
anyway<00:05:07.970> and<00:05:08.270> road<00:05:08.930> trip<00:05:09.200> or<00:05:09.440> something<00:05:09.710> like

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
anyway and road trip or something like

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.860 
anyway and road trip or something like
that<00:05:09.889> so<00:05:10.220> why<00:05:10.340> not<00:05:10.490> save<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.000> Aquafina<00:05:11.479> water

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
that so why not save the Aquafina water

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.590 
that so why not save the Aquafina water
bottle<00:05:12.200> it's<00:05:12.770> one<00:05:13.010> liter<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.970> got<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.150> pretty

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
bottle it's one liter it's got a pretty

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.680 
bottle it's one liter it's got a pretty
wide<00:05:14.870> mouth<00:05:15.139> not<00:05:15.860> too<00:05:16.100> bad<00:05:16.280> they're<00:05:16.910> virtually

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
wide mouth not too bad they're virtually

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.650 
wide mouth not too bad they're virtually
indestructible<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.710> they<00:05:19.550> weigh<00:05:19.729> in<00:05:19.790> at<00:05:20.330> one

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
indestructible and they weigh in at one

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.950 
indestructible and they weigh in at one
point<00:05:21.080> six<00:05:21.590> ounces<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:23.090> can't<00:05:23.570> think<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.840> a

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
point six ounces so I can't think of a

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.560 
point six ounces so I can't think of a
lighter<00:05:24.770> bottle<00:05:25.430> that's<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.240> market

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
lighter bottle that's on the market

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.350

today<00:05:26.720> plus<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.890> bottom<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.310> tapered<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:28.850> it's

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
today plus the bottom is tapered so it's

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.090 
today plus the bottom is tapered so it's
listen<00:05:29.780> to<00:05:29.930> your<00:05:30.050> side<00:05:30.320> pockets<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> little<00:05:31.010> bit

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
listen to your side pockets a little bit

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.529 
listen to your side pockets a little bit
easier<00:05:31.400> than<00:05:31.550> something<00:05:31.820> like<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.180> more

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
easier than something like a more

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.500 
easier than something like a more

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
squared to kind of bottom than a Nalgene

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.570 
squared to kind of bottom than a Nalgene
bottle<00:05:35.510> so<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:36.350> can't<00:05:36.590> beat<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.860> weight<00:05:37.039> can

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
bottle so you can't beat the weight can

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.060 
bottle so you can't beat the weight can
be<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.789> price<00:05:38.030> and<00:05:38.590> they're<00:05:39.590> really<00:05:39.860> great

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
be the price and they're really great

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.940 
be the price and they're really great
and<00:05:40.370> very<00:05:40.970> ergonomic<00:05:41.630> so<00:05:42.440> if<00:05:42.560> you're<00:05:42.740> new<00:05:42.919> to

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
and very ergonomic so if you're new to

and very ergonomic so if you're new to
ultra<00:05:43.640> light<00:05:43.850> backpacking<00:05:44.289> probably<00:05:45.289> a<00:05:45.320> lot

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530
