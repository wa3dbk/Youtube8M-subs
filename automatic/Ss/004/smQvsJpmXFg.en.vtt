it seems the chances of this crime ever
being<00:01:06.510> solved<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> highly<00:01:07.380> unlikely<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
being solved is highly unlikely but the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370

brutality and the mystery will continue

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.200

to<00:01:10.530> intrigue<00:01:10.799> us<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.580> entertain<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to intrigue us as we entertain the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
to intrigue us as we entertain the
thought<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.080> happened<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thought that it could have happened to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.850 
thought that it could have happened to
anyone

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.760 

I<00:01:21.960> suppose<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.080> would<00:01:23.200> have<00:01:23.320> helped<00:01:23.710> to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
I suppose it would have helped to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.050 
I suppose it would have helped to
actually<00:01:24.160> know<00:01:24.460> up<00:01:24.940> front<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.640> was<00:01:27.820> the

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
actually know up front that it was the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.390 
actually know up front that it was the
house<00:01:28.240> because<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:29.410> would<00:01:29.620> have<00:01:29.710> explained<00:01:30.190> a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
house because it would have explained a

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.030 
house because it would have explained a
lot<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.700> these<00:01:30.790> range<00:01:31.210> looks<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.320> notes<00:01:32.830> that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
lot of these range looks and notes that

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.560 
lot of these range looks and notes that
we<00:01:33.160> used<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.460> get<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.790> letterbox<00:01:34.090> and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
we used to get in the letterbox and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.480 
we used to get in the letterbox and
people<00:01:34.870> sort<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.140> driving<00:01:35.590> past<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.190> slowing

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
people sort of driving past and slowing

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.969 
people sort of driving past and slowing
down<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.690> know<00:01:37.780> taking<00:01:38.020> photos<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.770> think

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
down and you know taking photos I think

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.890 
down and you know taking photos I think
there's<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.160> number<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.520> reasons<00:01:39.729> why<00:01:40.180> we

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
there's a number of reasons why we

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.020 
there's a number of reasons why we
continue<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.440> be<00:01:41.560> fascinated<00:01:42.220> by<00:01:42.370> cold<00:01:42.670> cases

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
continue to be fascinated by cold cases

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.820 
continue to be fascinated by cold cases
one<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.750> course<00:01:43.960> i<00:01:44.110> think<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.500> an<00:01:44.590> almost

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
one of course i think is an almost

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.219 
one of course i think is an almost
psychological<00:01:45.700> need<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.120> see<00:01:46.300> resolution<00:01:47.050> and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
psychological need to see resolution and

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.140 
psychological need to see resolution and
in<00:01:47.320> cold<00:01:47.560> cases<00:01:47.830> we<00:01:48.100> don't<00:01:48.280> see<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.120> i

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
in cold cases we don't see that so i

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.850 
in cold cases we don't see that so i
think<00:01:49.300> we<00:01:49.630> almost<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> sense<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.650> anxiety

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
think we almost have a sense of anxiety

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.830 
think we almost have a sense of anxiety
I<00:01:51.460> mean<00:01:51.670> things<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.060> used<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.240> go<00:01:52.300> bump<00:01:52.720> in

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
I mean things that used to go bump in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.210 
I mean things that used to go bump in
the<00:01:52.900> night<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.560> scare<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.920> living<00:01:54.190> shit

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
the night is to scare the living shit

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.550 
the night is to scare the living shit
out<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.610> me<00:01:54.850> I'd<00:01:55.360> be<00:01:55.570> sort<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.810> watching<00:01:56.020> TV<00:01:56.200> in

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
