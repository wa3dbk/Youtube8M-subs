we haven't had a chance to play with the
phone<00:02:04.229> yet<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:04.829> know<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.130> how<00:02:05.250> fast

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
phone yet so we don't know just how fast

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.320 
phone yet so we don't know just how fast
it<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:07.259> let's<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> look<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.789> Nexus

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it is but let's take a look at the Nexus

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.140 
it is but let's take a look at the Nexus
5<00:02:09.539> next<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> Nexus<00:02:10.349> 4<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:11.970> see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
5 next to the Nexus 4 and as you can see

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.860 
5 next to the Nexus 4 and as you can see
definitely<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:13.050> Nexus<00:02:13.379> 5

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
definitely the Nexus 5

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
definitely the Nexus 5
taller<00:02:14.250> although<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.489> other<00:02:15.610> dimensions<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
taller although the other dimensions the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.949 
taller although the other dimensions the
Nexus<00:02:18.580> 5<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.909> a<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.030> bit<00:02:19.330> thinner<00:02:19.629> than<00:02:19.720> the

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
Nexus 5 is a little bit thinner than the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.360 
Nexus 5 is a little bit thinner than the
Nexus<00:02:20.230> 4<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:22.060> hair<00:02:22.390> wider<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.680> not

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
Nexus 4 and just a hair wider so not

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.680 
Nexus 4 and just a hair wider so not
much<00:02:24.519> different<00:02:24.909> in<00:02:25.000> terms<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.330> feeling<00:02:25.510> in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
much different in terms of feeling in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.530 
much different in terms of feeling in
the<00:02:25.780> hand<00:02:25.959> like<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.349> but<00:02:26.860> with<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.540> curves

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the hand like this but with the curves

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.059 
the hand like this but with the curves
back<00:02:28.810> here<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.140> feels<00:02:29.260> really<00:02:29.560> good<00:02:29.769> really

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
back here it feels really good really

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.559 
back here it feels really good really
solid<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.579> as<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.909> see<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.209> display<00:02:31.390> is

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
solid and as you can see the display is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.350 
solid and as you can see the display is
just<00:02:31.690> really<00:02:32.530> really<00:02:32.769> nice<00:02:32.950> very<00:02:33.280> clear<00:02:33.610> those

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
just really really nice very clear those

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.030 
just really really nice very clear those
colors<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:34.900> pop<00:02:34.989> off<00:02:35.409> the<00:02:35.560> screen<00:02:35.829> which

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
colors really pop off the screen which

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.860 
colors really pop off the screen which
is<00:02:36.069> something<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.670> Nexus<00:02:37.000> 4<00:02:37.209> never<00:02:37.510> did

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
is something that the Nexus 4 never did

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.619 
is something that the Nexus 4 never did
so<00:02:38.340> initial<00:02:39.340> impressions<00:02:39.849> are<00:02:40.000> very<00:02:40.329> good

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
so initial impressions are very good

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.440 
so initial impressions are very good
let's<00:02:41.230> take<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:41.440> quick<00:02:41.829> look<00:02:42.069> and<00:02:42.879> see<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.360> we

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
let's take a quick look and see what we

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.009 
let's take a quick look and see what we
have<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.110> box<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.739> believe<00:02:45.690> probably<00:02:46.690> not

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
have in the box I believe probably not

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.160 
have in the box I believe probably not
too<00:02:47.230> much<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:49.209> like<00:02:49.329> we<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.660> sim

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
too much it's like we have a sim

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.349 
too much it's like we have a sim
ejection<00:02:50.590> tool<00:02:50.769> here<00:02:51.519> probably<00:02:52.150> some

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
ejection tool here probably some

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.699 
ejection tool here probably some
