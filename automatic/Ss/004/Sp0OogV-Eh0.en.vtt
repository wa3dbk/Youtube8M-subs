welcome to another video from explaining
computers<00:00:16.800> comm<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:19.300> time<00:00:19.540> I'm<00:00:19.720> going<00:00:20.170> to

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
computers comm this time I'm going to

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.170 
computers comm this time I'm going to
talk<00:00:20.620> about<00:00:20.880> 3d<00:00:21.990> computer<00:00:22.990> graphics<00:00:24.060> over<00:00:25.060> the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
talk about 3d computer graphics over the

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.690 
talk about 3d computer graphics over the
past<00:00:25.420> few<00:00:25.630> years<00:00:25.720> on<00:00:26.230> my<00:00:26.680> youtube<00:00:27.160> channels

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
past few years on my youtube channels

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.990 
past few years on my youtube channels
I've<00:00:28.090> created<00:00:28.540> 3d<00:00:29.290> graphics<00:00:29.860> of<00:00:30.160> all<00:00:30.369> kinds<00:00:30.880> of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
I've created 3d graphics of all kinds of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.110 
I've created 3d graphics of all kinds of
things<00:00:31.270> ranging<00:00:31.900> from<00:00:32.560> computer<00:00:33.130> users<00:00:33.579> to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
things ranging from computer users to

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.170 
things ranging from computer users to
bio<00:00:34.420> computers<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.470> most<00:00:35.950> recently<00:00:36.490> bio

printers<00:00:38.220> in<00:00:39.220> this<00:00:39.460> video<00:00:39.820> I'm<00:00:40.060> going<00:00:40.450> to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
printers in this video I'm going to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.050 
printers in this video I'm going to
explain<00:00:40.690> how<00:00:41.410> these<00:00:41.920> animations<00:00:42.610> were

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
explain how these animations were

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:51.119 
explain how these animations were
created<00:00:48.809> ok<00:00:49.809> well<00:00:50.020> here<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.260> am<00:00:50.379> at<00:00:50.500> my<00:00:50.769> desk

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
created ok well here I am at my desk

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.220 
created ok well here I am at my desk
where<00:00:51.399> I<00:00:51.430> create<00:00:51.879> all<00:00:52.120> my<00:00:52.210> animations<00:00:53.079> and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
where I create all my animations and

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.229 
where I create all my animations and
indeed<00:00:53.440> all<00:00:53.590> my<00:00:53.739> explaining<00:00:54.699> Computers

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
indeed all my explaining Computers

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.330 
indeed all my explaining Computers
videos<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:56.289> I'm<00:00:56.379> running<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.739> package<00:00:57.129> called

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
videos and I'm running a package called

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.819 
videos and I'm running a package called
light<00:00:57.670> wave<00:00:57.940> which<00:00:58.719> I<00:00:58.870> use<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.230> produce<00:00:59.410> all

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
light wave which I use to produce all

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.240 
light wave which I use to produce all
the<00:01:00.250> 3d<00:01:00.670> models<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.410> can<00:01:02.590> see<00:01:02.769> here<00:01:02.949> on<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the 3d models you can see here on the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.000 
the 3d models you can see here on the
screen<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:04.120> model<00:01:04.480> of<00:01:04.660> the<00:01:05.019> cloud<00:01:05.500> computing

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
screen the model of the cloud computing

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.190 
screen the model of the cloud computing
steamroller<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:07.000> might<00:01:07.210> remember<00:01:07.360> from<00:01:07.720> the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
steamroller you might remember from the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.030 
steamroller you might remember from the
cloud<00:01:08.980> computing<00:01:09.700> videos<00:01:10.410> this<00:01:11.410> is<00:01:11.470> built<00:01:11.860> up

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
cloud computing videos this is built up

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.920 
cloud computing videos this is built up
in<00:01:12.160> different<00:01:12.370> layers<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.120> we've<00:01:13.270> got<00:01:13.480> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
in different layers so we've got the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.530 
in different layers so we've got the
main<00:01:14.140> body<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.040> engine<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.940> each<00:01:16.210> pilot

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
main body of the engine and each pilot

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.350 
main body of the engine and each pilot
has<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.960> move<00:01:17.200> front<00:01:17.860> roller<00:01:18.130> back<00:01:19.060> wheels

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
has to move front roller back wheels

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.319 
has to move front roller back wheels
small<00:01:20.290> flywheel<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.040> all<00:01:21.729> those<00:01:21.880> separate

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
small flywheel and all those separate

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.210 
small flywheel and all those separate
parts<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.880> make<00:01:25.030> objects<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.600> light<00:01:25.780> wave

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
parts to make objects in light wave

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.069 
parts to make objects in light wave
basically<00:01:27.220> if<00:01:27.280> we<00:01:27.340> create<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:28.060> new<00:01:28.329> object<00:01:28.540> here

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
basically if we create a new object here

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.380 
basically if we create a new object here
I've<00:01:29.950> got<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.159> number<00:01:30.369> of<00:01:30.729> different<00:01:31.180> tools

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
I've got a number of different tools

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.380 
I've got a number of different tools
available<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:32.560> for<00:01:32.710> example<00:01:33.100> if<00:01:33.189> I<00:01:33.369> create<00:01:34.000> a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
available so for example if I create a

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.819 
available so for example if I create a
disc<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> 12<00:01:36.700> sided<00:01:37.829> polygon

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
disc this is a 12 sided polygon

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.330 
disc this is a 12 sided polygon
effectively<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:41.380> what<00:01:41.920> I'm<00:01:41.979> going<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.130> do

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
effectively now what I'm going to do

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.950 
effectively now what I'm going to do
here<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.030> show<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.240> how<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:43.689> sort<00:01:43.930> of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
here just to show you how this sort of

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.020 
here just to show you how this sort of
stuff<00:01:44.110> works<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:45.009> make<00:01:45.189> nice<00:01:45.369> smooth<00:01:45.670> shapes

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
stuff works to make nice smooth shapes

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.120 
stuff works to make nice smooth shapes
I'm<00:01:46.210> going<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.390> get<00:01:46.479> rid<00:01:46.659> of<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.950> top<00:01:47.950> and

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
I'm going to get rid of the top and

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.100 
I'm going to get rid of the top and
bottom<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:48.759> now<00:01:49.450> going<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.659> activate<00:01:50.049> a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
bottom of that now going to activate a

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.039 
bottom of that now going to activate a
feature<00:01:50.469> called<00:01:51.070> sub<00:01:51.430> patching<00:01:52.049> which

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
feature called sub patching which

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.870 
feature called sub patching which
basically<00:01:53.500> turns<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:54.159> very<00:01:56.369> polygonal<00:01:57.369> object

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
basically turns a very polygonal object

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.410 
basically turns a very polygonal object
into<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.210> nice<00:01:58.390> smooth<00:01:58.899> surface<00:01:59.079> I<00:01:59.590> then<00:02:00.420> just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
into a nice smooth surface I then just

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.870 
into a nice smooth surface I then just
do<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.659> few<00:02:01.869> things<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.189> maybe<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.490> cut

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
do a few things to that so maybe I cut

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.440 
do a few things to that so maybe I cut
it<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.180> two<00:02:05.079> a<00:02:05.110> couple<00:02:05.409> of<00:02:05.649> times<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:06.450> knifing

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
it in two a couple of times just knifing

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.749 
it in two a couple of times just knifing
the<00:02:07.689> object<00:02:08.080> is<00:02:08.200> very<00:02:08.440> roughly<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.550> could

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the object is very roughly and I could

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.700 
the object is very roughly and I could
then<00:02:09.789> pick<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.479> top<00:02:10.690> polygons<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.500> maybe

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
then pick up the top polygons and maybe

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.150 
then pick up the top polygons and maybe
shrink<00:02:12.670> those<00:02:12.850> down<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> bit<00:02:13.840> maybe<00:02:14.680> pick<00:02:15.010> up

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
shrink those down a bit maybe pick up

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.600 
shrink those down a bit maybe pick up
the<00:02:15.370> points<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:16.000> top<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> object<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
the points on top of the object and

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.600 
the points on top of the object and
extend<00:02:18.610> them<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.510> bit<00:02:19.690> maybe<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:21.220> mount<00:02:21.519> a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
extend them up a bit maybe to mount a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.990 
extend them up a bit maybe to mount a
little<00:02:21.849> bit<00:02:22.030> here<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.040> maybe

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
little bit here and maybe

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.830 
little bit here and maybe
and<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.920> base<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.400> object<00:02:27.760> down<00:02:28.450> quite<00:02:28.810> a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
and the base of the object down quite a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.490 
and the base of the object down quite a
bit<00:02:29.050> not<00:02:29.740> being<00:02:30.010> terribly<00:02:30.220> accurate<00:02:31.500> maybe

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
bit not being terribly accurate maybe

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.880 
bit not being terribly accurate maybe
down<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.770> bit<00:02:32.980> more<00:02:33.480> down<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.540> bit<00:02:34.780> more<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.320> then

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
down a bit more down a bit more and then

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.600 
down a bit more down a bit more and then
maybe<00:02:36.420> bring<00:02:37.420> those<00:02:37.630> together<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.610> merge

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
maybe bring those together and merge

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.930 
maybe bring those together and merge
those<00:02:39.880> points<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.860> push<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.040> up<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.490> little

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
those points in push that up a little

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.750 
those points in push that up a little
bit<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.560> effectively<00:02:44.560> well<00:02:45.250> I've<00:02:45.400> done<00:02:45.580> is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
bit and effectively well I've done is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.100 
bit and effectively well I've done is
start<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.180> create<00:02:46.360> something<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.690> looks<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
start to create something that looks a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.590 
start to create something that looks a
little<00:02:47.380> bit<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.830> bottle<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.480> can

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
little bit like a bottle so as you can

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.330 
little bit like a bottle so as you can
see<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> very<00:02:49.900> quickly<00:02:50.320> go<00:02:50.620> from<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.890> simple

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
see you very quickly go from a simple

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.630 
see you very quickly go from a simple
basic<00:02:52.170> polygon<00:02:53.170> or<00:02:53.440> set<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.709> points<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.220> create

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
basic polygon or set of points to create

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.640 
basic polygon or set of points to create
an<00:02:54.820> actual<00:02:55.209> object<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.530> how

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
an actual object and that is how

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.190 
an actual object and that is how
something<00:02:57.100> like<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.970> steamroller<00:02:58.450> here<00:02:58.750> was

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
something like the steamroller here was

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.860 
something like the steamroller here was
actually<00:02:59.380> created<00:03:01.230> if<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.350> look<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
actually created if we look at the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.050 
actually created if we look at the
bioprinter<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.350> created<00:03:05.739> recently<00:03:06.160> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
bioprinter that I created recently the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.670 
bioprinter that I created recently the
way<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.239> create<00:03:07.540> most<00:03:07.750> objects<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.290> first<00:03:08.560> of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
way I create most objects is first of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.290 
way I create most objects is first of
all<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.920> start<00:03:09.190> out<00:03:09.400> with<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.610> drawing<00:03:10.150> so

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
all to start out with a drawing so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.530 
all to start out with a drawing so
here's<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> basic<00:03:11.080> drawing<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
here's the basic drawing of the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.770 
here's the basic drawing of the
bioprinter

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
bioprinter

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.449 
bioprinter
you<00:03:14.080> can<00:03:14.230> see<00:03:14.380> not<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.560> brilliant<00:03:15.010> drawing<00:03:15.280> but

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
you can see not a brilliant drawing but

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.550 
you can see not a brilliant drawing but
it<00:03:15.580> shows<00:03:15.820> me<00:03:16.030> roughly<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.750> types<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.320> shapes

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
it shows me roughly the types of shapes

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.850 
it shows me roughly the types of shapes
I'm<00:03:17.770> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> use<00:03:18.989> having<00:03:19.989> done<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.590> then

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
I'm going to use having done that I then

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.430 
I'm going to use having done that I then
created<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.580> very<00:03:22.000> simple<00:03:22.270> object<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.290> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
created a very simple object that you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.110 
created a very simple object that you
can<00:03:23.620> see<00:03:23.800> here<00:03:24.070> which<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.430> all<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.730> basic

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
can see here which is all the basic

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.940 
can see here which is all the basic
parts<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.230> bioprinter

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
parts of the bioprinter

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.890 
parts of the bioprinter
I've<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.520> just<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.790> very<00:03:28.030> very<00:03:28.239> simple<00:03:28.600> shapes

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
I've but just in very very simple shapes

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.600 
I've but just in very very simple shapes
and<00:03:29.380> again<00:03:29.620> splitting<00:03:30.070> it<00:03:30.190> out<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
and again splitting it out of a

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.370 
and again splitting it out of a
different<00:03:30.820> part<00:03:31.239> which<00:03:31.750> would<00:03:31.900> have<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.200> move

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
different part which would have to move

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.360 
different part which would have to move
separately<00:03:33.840> having<00:03:34.840> created<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.920> basic

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
separately having created this basic

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.160 
separately having created this basic
object<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.090> then<00:03:37.239> went<00:03:37.450> on<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.780> add<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> bit

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
object and then went on to add a bit

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.949 
object and then went on to add a bit
more<00:03:38.200> detail<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.239> can<00:03:40.390> see<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> more

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
more detail this you can see is a more

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.949 
more detail this you can see is a more
more<00:03:41.350> detailed<00:03:41.830> version<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.760> object<00:03:43.120> then

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
more detailed version of the object then

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.780 
more detailed version of the object then
added<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.290> bit<00:03:44.410> more<00:03:44.739> detail<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.489> is<00:03:45.640> now

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
added a bit more detail this is now

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.080 
added a bit more detail this is now
starting<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.209> look<00:03:46.299> quite<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.140> our<00:03:47.380> final

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
starting to look quite like our final

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.390 
starting to look quite like our final
bioprinter<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.330> then<00:03:49.930> finally<00:03:50.470> added<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.070> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
bioprinter and then finally added on the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.940 
bioprinter and then finally added on the
final<00:03:51.790> bits<00:03:51.970> of<00:03:52.120> detail<00:03:52.330> if<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.260> look<00:03:53.440> at<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.709> a

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
final bits of detail if I look at that a

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.620 
final bits of detail if I look at that a
little<00:03:54.190> bit<00:03:54.310> more<00:03:54.549> textured<00:03:55.090> added<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.450> can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
little bit more textured added you can

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.819 
little bit more textured added you can
see<00:03:55.840> we're<00:03:55.989> heading<00:03:56.260> towards<00:03:56.650> something

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
see we're heading towards something

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.410 
see we're heading towards something
which<00:03:57.190> is<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.329> final<00:03:58.750> object<00:04:00.420> once

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
which is like the final object once

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.210 
which is like the final object once
you've<00:04:01.570> got<00:04:01.750> an<00:04:01.870> object<00:04:02.019> like<00:04:02.350> this<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.829> then

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
you've got an object like this I then

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.060 
you've got an object like this I then
take<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.670> into<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.810> program<00:04:05.560> called<00:04:05.769> layout

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
take it into the a program called layout

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.979 
take it into the a program called layout
which<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.940> where<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.239> do<00:04:07.420> all<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:07.840> actual

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
which is where we do all the actual

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.710 
which is where we do all the actual
animation

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.750 

okay<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:12.200> here<00:04:12.710> we<00:04:12.800> are<00:04:12.830> in<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.580> layout

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
okay so here we are in the layout

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.390 
okay so here we are in the layout
package<00:04:14.330> I've<00:04:14.870> got<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.230> model<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:15.950> started

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
package I've got the model and I started

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.580 
package I've got the model and I started
to<00:04:16.519> surround<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.030> with<00:04:17.209> with<00:04:17.660> virtual<00:04:18.140> cameras

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
to surround it with with virtual cameras

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.070 
to surround it with with virtual cameras
if<00:04:19.220> we<00:04:19.370> look<00:04:19.489> at<00:04:19.610> the<00:04:19.700> model<00:04:20.000> through<00:04:20.900> one<00:04:21.049> of

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
if we look at the model through one of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080 
if we look at the model through one of
those<00:04:21.200> cameras<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.040> is<00:04:22.220> going<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.460> be<00:04:22.580> one

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
those cameras this is going to be one

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.810 
those cameras this is going to be one
the<00:04:23.360> first<00:04:23.600> shots<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.320> bioprinter<00:04:24.820> and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
the first shots of the bioprinter and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.260 
the first shots of the bioprinter and
we've<00:04:26.150> also<00:04:26.300> here<00:04:26.690> started<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.260> put<00:04:27.470> in<00:04:28.270> some

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
we've also here started to put in some

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.330 
we've also here started to put in some
animation<00:04:30.170> so<00:04:30.410> you<00:04:30.470> can<00:04:30.710> see<00:04:30.920> here<00:04:31.100> for<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
animation so you can see here for that

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.710 
animation so you can see here for that
particular<00:04:31.790> object<00:04:31.970> that's<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.540> bio

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
particular object that's the bio

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.260 
particular object that's the bio
printhead<00:04:33.350> it's<00:04:33.920> got<00:04:34.160> some<00:04:34.340> keyframes<00:04:34.580> added

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
printhead it's got some keyframes added

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.540 
printhead it's got some keyframes added
to<00:04:35.840> actually<00:04:36.350> animate<00:04:36.950> it<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.340> certain

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
to actually animate it in certain

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.820 
to actually animate it in certain
positions<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.300> make<00:04:38.450> it<00:04:38.600> move<00:04:38.780> back<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:39.530> forth

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
positions to make it move back and forth

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.370 
positions to make it move back and forth
we<00:04:40.460> pick<00:04:40.670> up<00:04:40.700> for<00:04:41.030> example<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.840> part<00:04:42.170> of<00:04:42.320> the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
we pick up for example the part of the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.430 
we pick up for example the part of the
object<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:43.640> rails<00:04:43.970> down<00:04:44.270> again<00:04:44.630> there<00:04:45.200> are

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
object that rails down again there are

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.130 
object that rails down again there are
some<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:45.950> key<00:04:46.430> frames<00:04:46.760> set<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.330> could<00:04:47.870> go<00:04:48.020> in

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
some and key frames set I could go in

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.220 
some and key frames set I could go in
alter<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.590> see<00:04:48.950> move<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.220> up<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.460> down<00:04:49.610> and

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
alter that see move it up and down and

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.760 
alter that see move it up and down and
when<00:04:51.230> I<00:04:51.290> do<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.880> set<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> keyframe<00:04:53.500> like<00:04:54.500> that

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
when I do that set a keyframe like that

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.980 
when I do that set a keyframe like that
with<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.100> keyboard<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:56.270> will<00:04:56.390> set<00:04:56.600> things<00:04:56.780> in

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
with the keyboard it will set things in

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.590 
with the keyboard it will set things in
place<00:04:57.230> but<00:04:58.220> also<00:04:58.460> notice<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:59.150> things<00:04:59.390> like

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
place but also notice that things like

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.420 
place but also notice that things like
these<00:04:59.780> tiny<00:05:00.020> ribbon<00:05:00.410> Cayden<00:05:00.740> here<00:05:00.980> cables

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
these tiny ribbon Cayden here cables

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.280 
these tiny ribbon Cayden here cables
here<00:05:01.730> are<00:05:02.090> all<00:05:02.240> set<00:05:02.450> up<00:05:02.570> to<00:05:02.690> automatically

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
here are all set up to automatically

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.380 
here are all set up to automatically
move<00:05:03.740> correctly<00:05:04.340> when<00:05:04.700> we<00:05:04.790> set<00:05:05.000> up<00:05:05.030> those

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
move correctly when we set up those

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.220 
move correctly when we set up those
particular<00:05:06.020> frames<00:05:07.690> we<00:05:08.690> want<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.930> see<00:05:09.080> what

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
particular frames we want to see what

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.990 
particular frames we want to see what
it's<00:05:09.350> going<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.530> look<00:05:09.680> like<00:05:09.890> I<00:05:10.190> can<00:05:10.610> make<00:05:10.820> a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
it's going to look like I can make a

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.620 
it's going to look like I can make a
render<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:13.040> frame<00:05:13.340> this<00:05:14.210> will<00:05:14.390> take<00:05:14.600> the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
render of the frame this will take the

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.270 
render of the frame this will take the
computer<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.110> second<00:05:15.500> just<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.650> work<00:05:15.890> out<00:05:16.100> the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
computer a second just to work out the

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.370 
computer a second just to work out the
final<00:05:16.520> frame<00:05:16.820> should<00:05:17.330> look<00:05:17.570> like<00:05:17.750> you're

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
final frame should look like you're

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.840 
final frame should look like you're
slightly<00:05:18.680> constrained<00:05:19.370> here<00:05:19.550> in<00:05:19.640> terms<00:05:19.760> of

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
slightly constrained here in terms of

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.880 
slightly constrained here in terms of
the<00:05:19.940> amount<00:05:20.150> of<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.330> screen<00:05:20.570> you<00:05:20.690> can<00:05:20.870> see<00:05:21.140> but

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
the amount of the screen you can see but

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.550 
the amount of the screen you can see but
this<00:05:22.010> is<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.370> very<00:05:22.760> rough<00:05:23.000> render<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:23.870> my<00:05:24.110> actual

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
this is a very rough render of my actual

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.560 
this is a very rough render of my actual
and<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.220> how<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.430> animation<00:05:25.910> will<00:05:26.090> look<00:05:26.330> and

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
and that how the animation will look and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.300 
and that how the animation will look and
I<00:05:26.930> use<00:05:27.110> rendering<00:05:27.530> of<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.770> quality<00:05:28.040> to

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
I use rendering of that quality to

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.520 
I use rendering of that quality to
produce<00:05:28.669> test<00:05:29.180> shots<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.900> look<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.140> bit<00:05:30.320> like

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
produce test shots that look a bit like

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.970 
produce test shots that look a bit like
this<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.730> here<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.510> can<00:05:32.720> see<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.169> test<00:05:33.650> render

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
this so here you can see a test render

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.420 
this so here you can see a test render
of<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.850> first<00:05:35.090> big<00:05:35.360> shot<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.810> bioprinter

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
of the first big shot of the bioprinter

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.890 
of the first big shot of the bioprinter
quality's<00:05:37.430> not<00:05:37.460> very<00:05:37.760> good<00:05:38.000> but<00:05:38.270> this<00:05:38.419> quality

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
quality's not very good but this quality

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.560 
quality's not very good but this quality
of<00:05:38.930> shot<00:05:39.140> allows<00:05:39.530> me<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.430> test<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.240> animation

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
of shot allows me to test the animation

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.480 
of shot allows me to test the animation
and<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.169> put<00:05:42.350> my<00:05:42.470> edit<00:05:42.710> together<00:05:42.860> without

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
and to put my edit together without

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.070 
and to put my edit together without
having<00:05:43.790> to<00:05:44.000> spend<00:05:44.210> too<00:05:44.390> much<00:05:44.570> time<00:05:44.630> in

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
having to spend too much time in

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.120 
having to spend too much time in
rendering<00:05:46.780> when<00:05:47.780> I'm<00:05:47.900> certain<00:05:48.890> there's<00:05:49.070> a

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
rendering when I'm certain there's a

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.300 
rendering when I'm certain there's a
shots<00:05:49.370> okay<00:05:49.880> I<00:05:50.150> then<00:05:50.660> go<00:05:50.840> into<00:05:51.220> what's<00:05:52.220> called

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
shots okay I then go into what's called

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.400 
shots okay I then go into what's called
the<00:05:52.460> render<00:05:52.790> global<00:05:53.120> setting<00:05:53.540> turn<00:05:54.020> on<00:05:54.200> all

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
the render global setting turn on all

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.290 
the render global setting turn on all
the<00:05:54.470> early<00:05:55.100> fancy<00:05:55.490> things<00:05:55.730> for<00:05:55.940> rendering

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
the early fancy things for rendering

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.360 
the early fancy things for rendering
what's<00:05:56.660> called<00:05:56.870> radiosity<00:05:57.320> which<00:05:57.800> lights<00:05:58.160> it

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
what's called radiosity which lights it

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.850 
what's called radiosity which lights it
with<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.520> nice<00:05:58.700> sort<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.330> diffused<00:05:59.960> look<00:06:00.200> turn

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.860 
with a nice sort of diffused look turn
on<00:06:00.980> things<00:06:01.250> like<00:06:01.310> shadows<00:06:01.870> transparency

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
on things like shadows transparency

on things like shadows transparency
occlusion<00:06:03.500> reflection<00:06:04.130> refraction<00:06:04.430> and<00:06:04.880> then

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
occlusion reflection refraction and then

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.840 
occlusion reflection refraction and then
when<00:06:05.840> I<00:06:05.870> push<00:06:06.169> render<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.950> time<00:06:07.310> it'll<00:06:07.610> take

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
when I push render this time it'll take

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.460 
when I push render this time it'll take
quite<00:06:08.210> a<00:06:08.270> while<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.810> produce<00:06:09.230> a<00:06:09.650> final<00:06:10.040> image

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
quite a while to produce a final image

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.020 
quite a while to produce a final image
however<00:06:12.470> when<00:06:13.040> that<00:06:13.070> process<00:06:13.520> is<00:06:13.640> completed

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
however when that process is completed

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.360 
however when that process is completed
we<00:06:14.600> end<00:06:14.750> up<00:06:14.870> with<00:06:14.960> a<00:06:14.990> final<00:06:15.290> shot<00:06:15.680> but<00:06:16.130> looks

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
we end up with a final shot but looks

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:29.240 
we end up with a final shot but looks
