00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Saw some requests for- "collect all eight pages"?

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.540
What?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.960
Man, you guys got me playing...the paperwork? Man, this paperwork ass game.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.260
"Collect all eight pages", man.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.960
Why am I in a forest?

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.280
Why are there trees? Trees have no relevance to paper.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.220
What am I doing in here, hm?

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.420
I see you can hold down 'shift' to run...

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.480
...and you run out of breath almost instantaneously.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.360
You are, uh, one of the most unfit people on the planet

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.580
I think I ran about for five seconds, there, then I ran out of breath.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.000
Oh- who put that there?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.080
Who put-

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.660
W-what is this stuff? What is this? Oh my g- (panting) What is that?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.500
What is that stuff?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.820
Oh god, let's- "Don't look... or it takes you."

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.680
...what does that even mean? (chuckles)

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720
Stupid papers.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.360
They don't even know.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.840
The second I grabbed that paper, I let a dinosaur loose in the park.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.440
And I can hear these really loud dino footsteps.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980
I'm by the gastank- "Can't run." I know!

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.200
I realized that two seconds into the game, I couldn't run.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.660
Oh, god, what is that? What is that noise?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Oh- get 'im! Get 'im! Fight 'im!

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.200
What? ...wait a minute.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.760
Man, I haven't seen face graphics this bad since Super Nintendo.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.840
Since Super Nintendo, man.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740
You guys got me playing some spook-ass games, man.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.740
Why you gotta make me play the spookiest games?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.940
What's over here? "Can't run." Yep. Still can't run.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
If I pick up a paper that says, "Can run,"

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100
is that like a...is that like a power-up?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.220
Like in Mega Man?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.340
(whispered) Aw, I hate this building, it's so...

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.040
Look at the roof! The roof just sucks.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.620
Ugh, where's the paper, where's the paper?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.140
It's in here, right?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.680
It's in- oh, Jesus Christ! Kill him! Left click to shoot!

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.940
It's not working!

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.800
I don't think you can shoot in this game. I'm gonna be that honest.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.900
I don't think you can shoot.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920
(whispered) Oh, it's the old spooky tree!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.780
Dude, I swear to god.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.680
I swear to god, if he's behind this tree, I'm gonna die.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.300
Oh my god, what is that?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160
Every time you pick up a paper, a new sound plays.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.240
I can hear ducks.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.640
Is that ducks?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.340
Oh, yeah. I don't even wanna pick this one up.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.400
Oh, my god.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460
Oh, my god, I'm gonna die.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.760
I'm gonna die!

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.940
Oh, no!

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.720
Oh, shit!

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.640
Stop picking up the papers! I'm gonna die!

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.480
Okay- I don't wanna go back in that building, man!

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.580
Slenderman's in there!

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.020
Oh, my god, no! He's right behind me! Oh, god!

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.800
Go in the building! Go in the building.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.300
You'll never find me, Slenderman.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.440
I know this building like the back of my hand.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.040
Uh, you take a left- take a right.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.860
I'm already lost.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.660
Um...

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.160
Take a left, take a left, take a left.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.440
Oh, god. Oh, god!

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.440
Go back, go back, go back- he's gonna get us!

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.720
(panting) Oh, god.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
He's gonna kill me!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.300
Now where is he?

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.660
Oh, god, I think I can just go out this way.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.440
Slenderman's old ass. He'll never catch me, man.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.960
Where- oh, god! Oh, god, he's right behind me!

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.360
Go! Go, go, go!

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.740
(panting) I'm gonna get killed. I'm gonna get-

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.600
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.440
Oh, my god.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.240
Oh, my god.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.380
When that Inception music starts playing, you know you're gonna die, man.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.920
You know you're gonna die.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.460
He's gonna find me.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.260
I can't- okay, okay. I just gotta keep my-

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.460
(screams)

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.420
Dammit!
