Express<00:00:13.769> base<00:00:14.429> station<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.690> big

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
Express base station this is a big

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
Express base station this is a big
significant<00:00:16.710> update<00:00:17.070> they<00:00:17.279> haven't<00:00:17.550> done<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
significant update they haven't done to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900 
significant update they haven't done to
the<00:00:18.000> airport<00:00:18.359> Express<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.900> several<00:00:19.320> years<00:00:19.910> now

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the airport Express in several years now

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
the airport Express in several years now
this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.180> probably<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.539> favorite<00:00:21.570> router

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
this is probably my favorite router

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.480 
this is probably my favorite router
because<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> adds<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> lot<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.980> features<00:00:23.130> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
because it adds a lot of features that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
because it adds a lot of features that
many<00:00:23.699> routers<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.510> other<00:00:24.900> brands<00:00:25.410> as

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
many routers don't have other brands as

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.470 
many routers don't have other brands as
well<00:00:25.680> as<00:00:25.890> Apple's<00:00:26.430> other<00:00:26.580> routers<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
well as Apple's other routers so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
well as Apple's other routers so
everything<00:00:28.050> about<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.590> simple<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.189> easy

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
everything about this is simple and easy

everything about this is simple and easy
to<00:00:29.550> use<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.179> simply<00:00:30.420> comes<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.929> airport

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to use it simply comes with the airport

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
to use it simply comes with the airport
express<00:00:31.740> itself<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.759> power<00:00:32.969> cord<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
express itself and the power cord so to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
express itself and the power cord so to
set<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.230> literally<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.680> plug<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.160> in

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
set it up you literally just plug it in

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.889 
set it up you literally just plug it in
and<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.880> you're<00:00:36.000> plugging<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.450> straight<00:00:36.660> into

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and if you're plugging it straight into

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
and if you're plugging it straight into
a<00:00:36.960> modem<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.950> plug<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> way

has dual broadband Wi-Fi which either
you<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.710> Wi-Fi<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.340> five<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> 2.4<00:01:18.479> gigahertz

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you have Wi-Fi at five and 2.4 gigahertz

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
you have Wi-Fi at five and 2.4 gigahertz
now<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.799> 2.4<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> slower<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.670> five<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
now it's 2.4 is slower than five you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
now it's 2.4 is slower than five you
have<00:01:21.390> any<00:01:21.689> device<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> uses<00:01:22.259> 2.4<00:01:22.920> it

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
network to a broadband is essentially

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.319 
network to a broadband is essentially
that<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.790> 2<00:01:27.360> bands<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.110> spectrum<00:01:28.920> 2.4<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> 5

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
that it's 2 bands of spectrum 2.4 and 5

that it's 2 bands of spectrum 2.4 and 5
gigahertz<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.900> means<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> best

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
gigahertz which means you get the best

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
gigahertz which means you get the best
of<00:01:31.650> both<00:01:31.860> worlds<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.700> network<00:01:33.030> is
