00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.940
 hi world is fabien for a 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.529
 any new hack video on call of 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.600
 duty modern warfare 3 this time 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.029
 it's on the map so interchange 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.439
 same as the fallen card is the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.210
 same type of hack simply your 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.970
 teammate or yourself to dispossess 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 a ps3 of aix to be able to edit the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750
 memory of the game in real time in 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.970
 quicktime memory editing for power 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.410
 touch the 9.7 of the jump for that 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.449
 become a super job simply 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.100
 so he's going to edit this value for 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.719
 put the super jumbo up there it's 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.090
 easy but good the vii is not yet 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.019
 handing in at the moment I'm talking to you he the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.969
 will certainly know soon 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.320
 by the way so you have to put the 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.969
 super young to be able to jump on the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.500
 spot where I am so on a piece of 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.120
 bridge that exceed once you 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.309
 are you need to remodel me 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.800
 the offset except that you have to do you 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.149
 need the master neither too powerful nor not 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.079
 quite powerful because if you put no 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.850
 pretty powerful you're not going 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.830
 pierced the sky bar yesterday so the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.470
 ceiling that just prevents you from 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.650
 get out of the map by the tunes neither too much 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.820
 violent nor too powerful what because 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.220
 you never put too much power 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 was going to take off in the air what and then 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.100
 you will give three days to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.780
 go down in the map so this level 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.790
 that's a little bit of nothing so in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.040
 this video is about yvan 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.689
 tories who was hosting the party 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.220
 so I thank him obviously it was 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.380
 really very very fun and that's 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.090
 frankly huge out of cards 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.829
 or is there a cap since 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.229
 my interchange already had the opportunity to 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.790
 out with the strategic coli package or 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.140
 a gap to go below the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.299
 map and then with another technique for 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.939
 go back to the top of the map but 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.380
 cards as we had to terminate 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.299
 it's really impossible to get out 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.390
 no it's the only one we'll say 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.680
 alternative to use this hack that does not 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.210
 contains no clip of course 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.590
 it's the super jump she the clip ya nothing 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.329
 funny I find since you do not have 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.149
 just press a key and then you 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.399
 get out of the amap it's not funny 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.210
 all what so here are the friends in all 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.280
 case I really hope this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.840
 exclusivity will have pleased you if it's the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.009
 case feel free to let go to lake go 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 take a ride on the couch chain 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.740
 tories since he deserves it amply 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.510
 and I'll see you again soon 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.600
 for next videos by all the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.600
 world
