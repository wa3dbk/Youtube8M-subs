00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.260
 hi everybody i'm still alive and i'm still doing 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.520
 lessons on the server with 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.759
 and this is 10 lesson lesson jubilee such here 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.000
 today we will do simple but not 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.029
 less useful lesson on squads text in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.099
 a sump that we need this file 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.100
 which you will find in the description below the video 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.270
 3d text server on which to be inserted 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.829
 3d text and actually well what 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.660
 go to our file here everything is described 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.719
 step by step if you don't understand something 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.010
 video that is to read here, in principle, I 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.569
 I think that everyone will understand 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:01.339
 So we go means in equal to ours 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:01:06.770
 mod we go spawn open our mod 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:12.799
 looking for a different public on game mode init 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 it is public here it is after the figure 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:21.079
 brackets copy and paste this one 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.130
 line glue 3d text label 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:27.930
 here means here it is written in these quotes 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.920
 the inscription that will actually be with us 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 on the server let's write for example 10 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.500
 lesson color white this color of your text 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.859
 in this table led all the text colors 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 i.e. color gray color blue 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.979
 you him if you want there up to seven color 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 you can insert 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.100
 color blue how do we let it happen either 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.140
 same here these numbers but I advise you to put 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.570
 It is better to insert these letters because 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.990
 that so you can understand at least that for 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:10.100
 the color of your 3d text is the coordinates 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:14.820
 your text, that is, it is x, it is z 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.190
 everything is described here and you should have been 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.750
 log into the server and I am a thousand times this 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.190
 showed how to save your coordinates 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.250
 and then find them in my documents folder 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.430
 this is somewhere sandra sue your files myself 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.100
 tariff position 1 means that you have 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.690
 figure 230 in my case is saved 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.170
 skin in which you appear and then 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.090
 immediately go xy and z 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.940
 this is if i'm not mistaken your turn 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.360
 the character is we do not need that is almost 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.420
 230 in my case, we allocate like this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.420
 here are two and three 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.640
 notice what's here and not 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.160
 I allocate, and here I give coordinates 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.190
 I highlight that is these, leaving them not 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.070
 deleting so i select comma to comma 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.940
 and inserting 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.910
 so second second second 901 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.140
 Yes, I just in the course would have been before 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.740
 those with these coordinates 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.390
 that you have already lured everything and save 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.490
 comply with the world compile compiler 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.620
 compile here so it will be 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.640
 right 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 waiting waiting waiting waiting 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.050
 How long have you been compiled 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:52.720
 close all close and run 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.900
 we start the server I hope you understand it 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.900
 because there are people who say 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.920
 that runs and did not say well actually 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.579
 here are our coordinates 10 lesson which 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.299
 We set, too, there is no our 3d text all 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.879
 easy enough i don't know it's easier to not be 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.150
 maybe nothing here throughout 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.639

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.979
