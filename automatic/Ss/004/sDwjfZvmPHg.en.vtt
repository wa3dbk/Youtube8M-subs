guys<00:00:25.740> ready<00:00:29.420> we're<00:00:30.420> gonna<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> baseline

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
guys ready we're gonna do a baseline

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.780 
guys ready we're gonna do a baseline
right<00:00:31.199> now<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.770> what<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.700> this

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right now and see what this what this

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:54.310 
right now and see what this what this
beast<00:00:33.030> puts<00:00:33.360> down

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.590 

all<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.010> are<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> results<00:00:56.600> 160

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
all right so here are the results 160

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
all right so here are the results 160
wheel<00:00:57.750> horsepower<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.530> almost<00:00:59.399> 155<00:01:00.300> pounds

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

pretty<00:01:02.430> awesome<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.780> much<00:01:03.960> actually

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pretty awesome not so much actually

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.530 
pretty awesome not so much actually
so<00:01:05.040> next<00:01:05.610> round<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.880> mods<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so next round of mods I need a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
so next round of mods I need a
supercharger<00:01:07.260> build<00:01:07.950> engine<00:01:08.310> intake<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
supercharger build engine intake and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:25.170 
supercharger build engine intake and
exhaust<00:01:09.590> let's<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.830> bad<00:01:11.040> boy<00:01:11.100> does

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.429 

you<00:01:26.180> want<00:01:26.390> us<00:01:26.450> complete<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.020> let's<00:01:27.170> look<00:01:27.320> at

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
you want us complete and let's look at

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.590 
you want us complete and let's look at
the<00:01:27.530> graphic<00:01:27.950> will<00:01:28.280> make<00:01:28.460> about<00:01:28.700> 4/10<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:29.509> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
the graphic will make about 4/10 at the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.219 
the graphic will make about 4/10 at the
wheels<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.399> almost<00:01:31.399> 360<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.930> found<00:01:33.140> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
wheels and almost 360 to found the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.499 
wheels and almost 360 to found the
torque<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.860> lady<00:01:34.670> did<00:01:34.909> boost<00:01:35.060> fits<00:01:35.299> in<00:01:35.390> right

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
torque so lady did boost fits in right

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.179 
torque so lady did boost fits in right
away<00:01:35.659> she<00:01:35.960> makes<00:01:36.140> fun<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.680> power<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
away she makes fun of power it's a

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.789 
away she makes fun of power it's a
really<00:01:37.490> fun<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:37.850> street<00:01:38.060> all<00:01:38.630> right<00:01:38.799> now

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
really fun on the street all right now

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.920 
really fun on the street all right now
we've<00:01:39.979> built<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.280> engine<00:01:40.930> high-compression

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
we've built the engine high-compression

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.250 
we've built the engine high-compression
pistons

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
pistons

00:01:43.260 --> 00:02:16.460 
pistons
and<00:01:43.710> almost<00:01:43.980> 30<00:01:44.280> pounds<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.610> fish

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.920 

well<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.520> took<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> lot<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> work<00:02:18.360> because<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
well it took a lot of work because the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.690 
well it took a lot of work because the
tires<00:02:19.140> kept<00:02:19.410> spinning<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.920> dyno<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.370> heat

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
tires kept spinning on the dyno so heat

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.200 
tires kept spinning on the dyno so heat
him<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:20.940> put<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.020> slicks<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.310> strap<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.180> down

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
him up put on slicks and strap it down

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.380 
him up put on slicks and strap it down
really<00:02:24.630> hard<00:02:25.250> because<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.730> making<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.240> much

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
really hard because it's making so much

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.880 
really hard because it's making so much
power<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.780> torque<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.410> let's<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.740> what

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
power and torque and let's see what

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.700 
power and torque and let's see what
actually<00:02:29.370> did<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:31.310> 660<00:02:32.310> wheel<00:02:32.460> horsepower

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
actually did about 660 wheel horsepower

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.530 
actually did about 660 wheel horsepower
560<00:02:34.710> foot-pounds<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.190> torque<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.270> at

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
560 foot-pounds of torque and that's at

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.220 
560 foot-pounds of torque and that's at
20<00:02:36.840> pounds<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> boost<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.530> race<00:02:37.740> gas<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
20 pounds of boost on race gas on the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.860 
20 pounds of boost on race gas on the
2018<00:02:40.260> Nissan<00:02:40.860> Sentra<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> result<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.750> our

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
2018 Nissan Sentra so the result of our

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360 
2018 Nissan Sentra so the result of our
two<00:02:46.080> rounds<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.470> modifications<00:02:47.160> made

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
two rounds of modifications made

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
two rounds of modifications made
considerable<00:02:48.000> gains<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:49.080> bigger<00:02:49.260> turbo<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
considerable gains the bigger turbo and

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.410 
considerable gains the bigger turbo and
race<00:02:49.920> gas<00:02:50.100> made<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> really<00:02:50.760> huge<00:02:51.030> improvement

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
race gas made a really huge improvement

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.690 
race gas made a really huge improvement
in<00:02:51.450> power<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.980> reality<00:02:53.340> though<00:02:53.490> it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
in power in a reality though it's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
in power in a reality though it's
obvious<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.180> car<00:02:54.420> never<00:02:54.660> left<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.230> dyno<00:02:55.500> we

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
obvious this car never left the dyno we

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.070 
obvious this car never left the dyno we
shot<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.490> video<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.820> about<00:02:57.150> 50<00:02:57.570> minutes<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
shot this video in about 50 minutes and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.230 
shot this video in about 50 minutes and
the<00:02:58.440> huger<00:02:58.770> gains<00:02:58.920> were<00:02:59.070> simply<00:02:59.430> made<00:02:59.700> by

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
the huger gains were simply made by

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.790 
the huger gains were simply made by
adjusting<00:03:00.630> settings<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.260> Mustang<00:03:01.650> down

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
adjusting settings in the Mustang down

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
many settings that can drastically

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.480 
many settings that can drastically
impact<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.480> horsepower<00:03:06.930> readings<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:08.370> get
