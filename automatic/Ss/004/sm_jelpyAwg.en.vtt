you just start with you know a little
small<00:02:15.280> seed<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.939> it<00:02:16.090> comes<00:02:16.299> it<00:02:16.510> grows<00:02:16.900> into

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
small seed and it comes it grows into

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.960 
small seed and it comes it grows into
something<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.680> becomes<00:02:18.099> very<00:02:18.400> beautiful

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
something that becomes very beautiful

and<00:02:19.209> it's<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.930> same<00:02:20.170> way<00:02:20.409> with<00:02:20.709> info<00:02:21.250> for

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
and it's the same way with info for

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.910 
and it's the same way with info for
change<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> idea<00:02:22.689> of<00:02:23.110> making<00:02:23.650> an
