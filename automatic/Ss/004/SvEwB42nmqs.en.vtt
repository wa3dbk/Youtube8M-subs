outside and look at you big air bag have

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
outside and look at you big air bag have
a<00:00:19.109> little<00:00:19.410> tea<00:00:19.650> up<00:00:19.830> there<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.189> lift<00:00:20.490> my<00:00:20.670> light

out and i'm not going to crawl get it so
lazy<00:00:24.810> anyway<00:00:25.590> read<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.189> lines<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:26.910> i

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
lazy anyway read my lines out there i

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.550 
lazy anyway read my lines out there i
gave<00:00:27.840> ample<00:00:28.410> enough<00:00:29.240> line<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> air<00:00:30.720> bags

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gave ample enough line so the air bags

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
gave ample enough line so the air bags
and<00:00:31.769> go<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.189> down<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.399> our<00:00:32.669> binding

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and go up and down on our binding

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.280 
and go up and down on our binding
because<00:00:33.360> they're<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
because they're gonna have to do that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.280 
because they're gonna have to do that
the<00:00:35.040> compressor<00:00:35.550> works<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:36.239> went<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the compressor works i went to a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
the compressor works i went to a
self-test<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.910> doesn't<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.239> air<00:00:39.540> up

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
self-test but it doesn't really air up

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
self-test but it doesn't really air up
as<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> should<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.579> rear

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
as much as it should because the rear

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170 
as much as it should because the rear
and<00:00:42.030> raina<00:00:42.420> dumped<00:00:42.960> set<00:00:43.649> sensor<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.910> right

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and raina dumped set sensor is all right

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
and raina dumped set sensor is all right
down<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:48.020> only<00:00:49.020> runs<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.530> 15<00:00:49.920> seconds

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
down and the only runs like 15 seconds

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.910 
down and the only runs like 15 seconds
because<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.149> level<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> car<00:00:52.350> obviously

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
because it can level the car obviously

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.630 
because it can level the car obviously
cuz<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> weights<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> springs

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
cuz all the weights off on the springs

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.889 
cuz all the weights off on the springs
every<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> let<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
every way we got to let this down in a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.979 
every way we got to let this down in a
minute<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> works<00:00:59.840> that's<00:01:00.840> how

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
minute and see if it works that's how

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.609 
minute and see if it works that's how
you<00:01:01.050> put<00:01:01.289> air<00:01:01.469> ride<00:01:01.500> oh<00:01:02.420> yeah<00:01:03.420> at<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.930> ride<00:01:04.290> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you put air ride oh yeah at a ride I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
you put air ride oh yeah at a ride I
mean<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.489> rid<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> air<00:01:05.939> shocks<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
mean they get rid of the air shocks so I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.300 
mean they get rid of the air shocks so I
got<00:01:07.260> bilsteins<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:09.409> put<00:01:10.409> air<00:01:10.619> less<00:01:10.890> instead

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
got bilsteins and put air less instead

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.969 
got bilsteins and put air less instead
and<00:01:11.520> still<00:01:11.729> keep<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> factory<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.720> ride<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and still keep the factory a ride on

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.429 
and still keep the factory a ride on
your<00:01:14.040> genome<00:01:14.970> compressor<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:16.020> cool<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
your genome compressor pretty cool I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.429 
your genome compressor pretty cool I
didn't<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.430> mod<00:01:17.640> someone<00:01:18.180> did

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
didn't think of the mod someone did

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.780 
didn't think of the mod someone did
pretty<00:01:19.439> smart<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:22.110> spray<00:01:23.100> Bolland<00:01:23.460> around

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pretty smart and I spray Bolland around

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
pretty smart and I spray Bolland around
a<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:24.000> bit<00:01:24.240> still<00:01:24.630> looks<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.020> but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
a little bit still looks like but

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
a little bit still looks like but
whenever<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:27.119> should<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> same<00:01:27.900> take

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
whenever really should the same take

grow up as a little connector I ran the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.539 
grow up as a little connector I ran the
line<00:02:31.049> these<00:02:31.350> little<00:02:31.650> factory<00:02:32.040> brackets

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
line these little factory brackets

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.840 
line these little factory brackets
already<00:02:33.000> there<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.830> use<00:02:34.830> white<00:02:35.130> zip<00:02:35.400> ties<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
already there I use white zip ties I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.170 
already there I use white zip ties I
hate<00:02:36.030> white<00:02:36.180> zip<00:02:36.480> ties<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> rushed<00:02:38.760> up<00:02:39.000> there
