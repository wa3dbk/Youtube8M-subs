 Y 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.100
 Hello friends gotten passport 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.000
 here is the 360 â€‹â€‹coverage of everything 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.130
 this world cup brazil-2014 what game what 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 role will have in history for many 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.599
 as for a server the best all 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.700
 times had the best stories had 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.130
 the big games in the first round 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.710
 had the dramatic definitions in the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.300
 second round had the capitalized boleada 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.670
 from germany to brazil to Brazil 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.860
 I understood that this is about football and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.870
 that here came to live football does not 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.070
 wine that brazil was champion here 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.690
 He also came to live as the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.580
 Argentines regained faith in this 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.940
 same sport in this same instance 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.670
 the Germans always punctual 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 Brazil-2014 has wonderful stories 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.210
 but it is the best world cup in history 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.940
 let's see what the friends of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.270
 the bar in this adidas passport if of 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.519
 the recent ones undoubtedly this the the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.000
 best first phase that touched me 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.829
 see the wonderful round of 16 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.110
 I think there was a one as an interruption 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.869
 in the quarterfinals where if it came down 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.230
 the level of play where she sees herself 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.900
 saw the most worried teams 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.210
 for not losing that for seeking the triumph 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.460
 advance to the next phase and if I believe 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.470
 Brazil 2014 is the best glass of the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.440
 world of history overcome them alves to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.560
 the one of mexico-86 probably overcoming 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 although we did not see that of mexico-1970 the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.250
 football proposal the goals the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.230
 show 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.830
 the good ball deal has been a 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.590
 great world that has been played of 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.350
 very good shape because it has been very 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.720
 even because that kind of football there 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.210
 I like a structured game from the back 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.550
 Forwards , goals have been scored 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.370
 and not only that, but also the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.520
 goalkeepers have been figures that is there are 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.500
 a set of situations that end 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 for putting football on high for me 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.010
 I do not think it's the best global of the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.720
 history has been a good global has 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.640
 had spectacular games protect 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.990
 to all bad parties and has had 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.500
 of everything has had very 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.020
 exciting many goals moments 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.690
 dramatic injuries fractures have had 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.610
 anecdotal moments like those of Luis 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.960
 Suarez and his bite or the change that 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.480
 performs the rival 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.670
 but for the penalty shootout I do not know 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.890
 if it is the best cup in the world what 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.320
 is that it has been lovely 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.270
 seductive teams that have proposed the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.400
 teams that have managed to prevail and if 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.400
 well it is true the plebeians have 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.710
 moderately afraid of the big ones 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.900
 important those who always win the 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.000
 World Cups are in the instance 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.280
 final and particular friend I think 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 fantastic that not everyone has 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.460
 access to the world cup that's why 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.460
 it's so charming like that for a 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.460
 player 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.760
 all the equipment at a given moment 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.760
 they made their best on a court 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.269
 weapons 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.950
 and to communicate cutting with the first 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.379
 round from this world was insurmountable 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 I believe our calculate the round of 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.950
 eighth was good the quarter was very 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.980
 bad but when you have a semifinal 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.629
 with which we enter Holland and Argentina 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.269
 you have doubts, not if it's the world crazy 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.150
 that modifies and also leaves us that 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.549
 memorable chapter if in Germany so 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.349
 before Brazil 1 a match which 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.140
 Keep talking during the 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.269
 next 100 years and may spend 50 100 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.859
 years and they will continue talking about the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.849
 Germany against Brazil 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.379
 semifinals to decide this tragedy 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.540
 Dantesque macabre of what happened between 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.349
 germany and the team that brazil in 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.500
 semifinals 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.000
 so if something was missing then you already have it 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.389
 also this world cup has been a 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.709
 great world that's safe from 86 and 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.260
 the following worlds I do not doubt 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.799
 that this has been better in 2014 I think 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.530
 the world cup has all of its 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.210
 editions something to highlight something that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.010
 comment something to put the to 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.140
 the honor roll and something that also 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.210
 exposes the dark picture and in this has 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.700
 there were many dark things of course 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.080
 so yes so the eye of the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.940
 history 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.990
 we do not want to talk about if it 's the best 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.300
 or not of history 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.739
 there are many worlds that we did not see say 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.410
 that the 70's with the best world cup 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.930
 history would have to see it seems to me that of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.120
 what has been seen in 2014 in Brazil 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.920
 It is one of the best in the world 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.170
 story and I also believe that the best is 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.730
 to come I have seen in these world 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.500
 since 1977 the truth with much luxury 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.800
 video what it is that is much better 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.810
 that in 2010 2006 or speak the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.760
 of 2002 that for me was the worst 500 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.430
 move and then I think the final 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.490
 will depend a lot to be able to the last 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.710
 qualifiers and is that for 2014 is the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.190
 world's best we've seen I think 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.830
 that at the end of the day 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.440
 and this comes to an end we want to thank 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.990
 wholeheartedly to the adidas brand by 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.150
