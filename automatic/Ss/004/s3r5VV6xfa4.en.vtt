double pronged attack so Adam yeah this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.089 
double pronged attack so Adam yeah this
is<00:00:12.960> what<00:00:13.110> I'll<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.259> getting<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.860> do<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
is what I'll be getting you to do is

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.379 
is what I'll be getting you to do is
I'll<00:00:14.250> be<00:00:14.370> getting<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.820> make<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.059> stand<00:00:15.240> at

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
I'll be getting you to make you stand at

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.269 
I'll be getting you to make you stand at
the<00:00:15.450> bar<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.719> well<00:00:15.870> right<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.100> but

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the bar as well right like that but

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.040 
the bar as well right like that but
maybe<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:18.119> I'd<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.420> we'd<00:00:18.600> spread<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
maybe what I'd do is we'd spread out a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.660 
maybe what I'd do is we'd spread out a
little<00:00:19.199> bit<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.529> we're<00:00:19.800> both<00:00:20.130> occupying

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
little bit because we're both occupying

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.010 
little bit because we're both occupying
the<00:00:20.820> same<00:00:20.970> space<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.510> we've<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> same

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the same space so we've got the same

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.779 
the same space so we've got the same
probability<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> getting<00:00:22.740> served<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.340> I'd

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
probability of getting served so I'd

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580 
probability of getting served so I'd
probably<00:00:24.060> get<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> further<00:00:25.320> down

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
probably get you to go to further down

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
probably get you to go to further down
the<00:00:25.740> bar<00:00:25.920> we've<00:00:26.400> both<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.779> as

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the bar we've both get here and then as

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.470 
the bar we've both get here and then as
the<00:00:28.260> bar<00:00:28.470> mates<00:00:28.680> walking<00:00:29.039> past<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.670> would<00:00:30.240> say

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the bar mates walking past I would say

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.400 
the bar mates walking past I would say
