00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
many you can have running at once one of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.060 
many you can have running at once one of
the<00:02:50.690> battery<00:02:50.990> playbooks<00:02:51.350> main<00:02:51.560> features<00:02:51.980> that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
is that it is incredible at multitasking

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.410 
is that it is incredible at multitasking
