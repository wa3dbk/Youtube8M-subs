April although my arm is fine
my<00:00:21.829> back<00:00:22.070> isn't<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.060> this<00:00:23.539> is<00:00:23.689> what<00:00:23.869> I've<00:00:23.989> moved

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
my back isn't so this is what I've moved

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.290 
my back isn't so this is what I've moved
to<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.189> 2012<00:00:25.849> Polaris<00:00:26.660> RZR<00:00:27.460> 800<00:00:28.460> CCS

and<00:00:29.630> this<00:00:30.199> is<00:00:30.439> my<00:00:30.830> new<00:00:31.039> off-road<00:00:31.849> toy<00:00:32.350> one<00:00:33.350> of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
and this is my new off-road toy one of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.530 
and this is my new off-road toy one of
the<00:00:33.589> things<00:00:33.800> that<00:00:34.040> I<00:00:34.070> had<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.489> do<00:00:34.670> right<00:00:35.239> away

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
the things that I had to do right away

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.710 
the things that I had to do right away
was<00:00:36.440> mount<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.890> GoPro<00:00:37.040> camera<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.150> I<00:00:38.390> tried

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
was mount the GoPro camera and I tried

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.279 
was mount the GoPro camera and I tried
three<00:00:39.350> different<00:00:39.829> ways<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.430> see<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:40.850> works

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
three different ways to see what works

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:44.770 
three different ways to see what works
the<00:00:42.289> GoPro<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.739> mounted<00:00:43.219> right<00:00:43.399> here<00:00:43.460> to<00:00:44.239> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the GoPro is mounted right here to the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.250 
the GoPro is mounted right here to the
roll<00:00:44.989> bar<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:46.579> pro<00:00:46.879> makes<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.629> roll<00:00:48.020> bar

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
roll bar and go pro makes a roll bar

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.619 
roll bar and go pro makes a roll bar
mount<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:48.920> has<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.129> very<00:00:49.370> large<00:00:49.699> clamp<00:00:50.300> and

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
mount which has a very large clamp and

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.990 
mount which has a very large clamp and
then<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.199> couple<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.770> extensions<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.879> you

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
then a couple of extensions so that you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.729 
then a couple of extensions so that you
can<00:00:53.210> get<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.570> thing<00:00:53.780> angled<00:00:54.170> just<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.590> way

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
can get the thing angled just the way

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.660 
can get the thing angled just the way
that<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.100> want<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.780> now<00:00:56.780> I<00:00:57.079> tried<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:58.039> at<00:00:58.280> first

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
that you want to now I tried it at first

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.729 
that you want to now I tried it at first
just<00:00:59.359> with<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.780> mount<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.289> it<00:01:00.379> looked<00:01:00.590> like

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
just with the mount and it looked like

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.609 
just with the mount and it looked like
this<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:03.519> you<00:01:04.519> see<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.970> camera<00:01:05.840> kind<00:01:06.289> of<00:01:06.380> out

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
this and you see that camera kind of out

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.660 
this and you see that camera kind of out
there<00:01:06.830> on<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.369> top<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:09.670> little

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
there on the top of that little

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.699 
there on the top of that little
extension<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.780> might<00:01:11.990> guess<00:01:12.229> it's<00:01:12.470> going

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:12.709 
extension and you might guess it's going

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:15.749 
extension and you might guess it's going
to<00:01:12.830> vibrate<00:01:13.009> well<00:01:13.580> let<00:01:14.000> me<00:01:14.030> show<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.720> does

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
to vibrate well let me show you it does

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.330 
to vibrate well let me show you it does
even<00:01:16.759> on<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.060> smooth<00:01:17.509> road<00:01:18.009> relatively<00:01:19.009> smooth

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
even on a smooth road relatively smooth

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.820 
even on a smooth road relatively smooth
Road<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.450> thing<00:01:20.660> vibrates<00:01:20.929> up<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.619> down

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
Road the thing vibrates up and down

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.600 
Road the thing vibrates up and down
quite<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> bit<00:01:22.640> unacceptably<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:25.069> vibrates

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
quite a bit unacceptably so it vibrates

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.320 
quite a bit unacceptably so it vibrates
so<00:01:25.819> quickly<00:01:26.239> that<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:27.229> power<00:01:28.330> director

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
so quickly that the power director

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.749 
so quickly that the power director
software<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.110> use<00:01:30.229> can't<00:01:31.039> take<00:01:31.489> the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
software that I use can't take the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.309 
software that I use can't take the
vibration<00:01:32.630> out<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:35.000> next<00:01:35.030> thing<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.959> I

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
vibration out so the next thing that I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.120 
vibration out so the next thing that I
tried<00:01:36.709> to<00:01:36.739> do<00:01:37.239> was<00:01:38.239> mount<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.110> just<00:01:39.140> with<00:01:39.830> the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
tried to do was mount it just with the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.520 
tried to do was mount it just with the
clamp<00:01:40.520> right<00:01:41.300> here<00:01:41.599> just<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.229> clamp

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
clamp right here just with the clamp

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.430 
clamp right here just with the clamp
take<00:01:42.800> out<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.190> extensions<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.229> it's<00:01:45.229> much

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
take out the extensions and it's much

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.609 
take out the extensions and it's much
better<00:01:45.739> when<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.399> see<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.670> here<00:01:46.880> on<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.619> smooth

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
better when we see it here on a smooth

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.369 
better when we see it here on a smooth
surface<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:50.140> again<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.319> rough<00:01:51.590> surface<00:01:53.379> one

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:54.379 
surface and again on a rough surface one

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.719 
surface and again on a rough surface one
of<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.560> problems<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.629> that<00:01:57.250> we<00:01:58.250> still<00:01:58.520> have<00:01:58.700> a

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
of the problems is that we still have a

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.369 
of the problems is that we still have a
little<00:01:58.910> bit<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.239> vibration<00:01:59.450> there's<00:02:00.170> quite<00:02:00.349> a

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:00.379 
little bit of vibration there's quite a

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:01.869 
little bit of vibration there's quite a
bit<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.649> vibration<00:02:01.039> when<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.459> engine<00:02:01.759> is

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:01.879 
bit of vibration when the engine is

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.369 
bit of vibration when the engine is
idling<00:02:02.179> and<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.920> addition<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:05.379> the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:06.379 
idling and in addition to that the

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.559 
idling and in addition to that the
cameras<00:02:07.069> not<00:02:07.280> mounted<00:02:07.759> Square<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.270> ground

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
cameras not mounted Square to the ground

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.630 
cameras not mounted Square to the ground
this<00:02:08.810> roll<00:02:09.080> bar<00:02:09.319> leans<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.250> little<00:02:10.280> way

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
this roll bar leans in just a little way

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.960 
this roll bar leans in just a little way
so<00:02:11.629> I<00:02:11.660> thought<00:02:11.989> well<00:02:12.260> gee<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:13.190> need<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.610> camera

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so I thought well gee I need the camera

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.910 
so I thought well gee I need the camera
mounted<00:02:14.300> correctly<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.319> somehow<00:02:15.590> I've<00:02:15.890> got

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
mounted correctly but somehow I've got

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.550 
mounted correctly but somehow I've got
to<00:02:16.099> dampen<00:02:16.579> those<00:02:16.730> vibrations<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.290> found

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
to dampen those vibrations so I found

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.750 
to dampen those vibrations so I found
this<00:02:18.709> old<00:02:18.980> lycra<00:02:19.909> bicycling<00:02:20.780> shorts<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
this old lycra bicycling shorts the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
jump up and down a little bit but that's

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.270 
jump up and down a little bit but that's
because<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.810> razor's<00:02:50.290> jumping<00:02:50.830> up<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.160> down

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
because the razor's jumping up and down

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.380 
because the razor's jumping up and down
quite<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.849> bit

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
quite a bit

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.140 
quite a bit
still<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.290> remarkably<00:02:54.220> smooth<00:02:54.790> it's

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
still it's remarkably smooth it's

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.390 
still it's remarkably smooth it's
actually<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.599> smoother<00:02:56.080> view<00:02:56.380> than<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.799> get<00:02:57.099> from

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
actually a smoother view than I get from

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.610 
actually a smoother view than I get from
the<00:02:57.519> driver's<00:02:57.970> seat<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:59.049> I<00:02:59.080> think<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.560> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
the driver's seat so I think this is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.039 
the driver's seat so I think this is
probably<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.610> do<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.569> roll<00:03:01.780> bar

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
probably the way to do it the roll bar

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.740 
probably the way to do it the roll bar
mount<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:03.160> extension<00:03:03.849> so<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.599> get

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
mount the extension so that you can get

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.720 
mount the extension so that you can get

the camera angled at just the right

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.660 
the camera angled at just the right
angle<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.450> want<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:08.130> some<00:03:09.130> kind<00:03:09.489> of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
angle that you want it some kind of

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.110 
angle that you want it some kind of
shock<00:03:10.180> absorbing<00:03:10.780> material<00:03:11.319> in<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.620> case

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
