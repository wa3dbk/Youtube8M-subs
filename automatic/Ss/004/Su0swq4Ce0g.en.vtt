00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello in touch with Sergei Ivanov 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.899
 new video lessons today will not 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.769
 invent anything 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.440
 just show you how in 5 minutes maybe 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.809
 even less can be added on to the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.369
 Here's a photo here such here 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:25.050
 effect and so let's start us 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:32.369
 need a palette of layers window layers 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:36.350
 or press f7 let's remove here from us 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.800
 there are photos and now the whole field chip 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 go to google we enter abstraction 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.950
 enter abstractions and examples choose 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.590
 abstraction flowers 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.800
 look at our photo again 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.109
 light we need to those who are dark 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.109
 Pictures 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.109
 Here it will suit us and in the example here it is 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.549
 opened the picture clicked printscreen 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.460
 made a copy of the screen went into photoshop 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.930
 edit insert was put here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.299
 we take one picture second print 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 screen 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:29.970
 We insert photoshop and place 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.790
 example so here we have two pictures layers 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.250
 they can be turned off and on 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:42.619
 look so that's what needs to be done not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 need to do just one action go 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.759
 blending options here where in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.649
 the layers palette will be on top and select 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.189
 any mode imposed there let's 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.290
 to 1 we take some which to us 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.290
 any suitable 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.320
 we twist 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.610
 example stopped on this here you can 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.380
 change the opacity put there 30 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.070
 percent 70 70 and for this, too, change 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:25.580
 blend mode which is lighter here 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:27.740
 there we take lighter that's the principle 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.290
 add us now let add 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.600
 mask click on this button add 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.600
 mask here and here we are now 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.290
 human move to the foreground on 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.830
 This layer will erase some of the information on 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.070
 this mask is added now we take 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.130
 black brush with soft edges 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.570
 we press on the earth we press the right button 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.370
 and choose that's tough anyway zero 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:02.120
 you can change the size of the brush and so 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.370
 Here we go along the girl there is no should 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.750
 be white was all right 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.630
 brush black black color rubs so 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.320
 how do we have white here 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.320
 single layer 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:34.190
 and all 2 here is always neatly possible 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.120
 put white color and go back 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:45.000
 or also have a kontrol key combination 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:51.440
 set overwritten what we do not need me roughly 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.440
 I think the principle you understand what I'm doing 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:09.630
 here it seems the effects of the girl what else 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:12.390
 can be made possible here that these layers 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.010
 top and pour pour use 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.220
 filter leads filters examples you 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:25.380
 blur radial blur and select 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:29.280
 example ring OK effect time and for 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.780
 This example filter is also a blur or 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.660
 any other filter you can 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.120
 use figure 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:41.280
 Here selects the type of figure by which you 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:44.240
 want to blur there blurs you play 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.240
 with opacity 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 You can also play overlay modes. 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.860
 any time to put
