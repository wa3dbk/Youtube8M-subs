00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
so far would be and then you would

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
so far would be and then you would
repeat<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.810> again<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.500> have

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:04.890 

this<00:02:49.000> time<00:02:49.240> you'd<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:52.890> CD<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.570> then<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.810> would

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
this time you'd go CD and then you would

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:19.610 
this time you'd go CD and then you would
put<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.110> together<00:03:05.640> like

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.199 

and<00:03:20.620> then<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:22.510> would<00:03:22.750> do<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.170> same<00:03:23.440> thing<00:03:23.740> on

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and then you would do the same thing on

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.880 
and then you would do the same thing on
the<00:03:25.209> left<00:03:25.390> hand<00:03:25.720> still<00:03:26.110> only<00:03:26.290> adding<00:03:26.680> another

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
the left hand still only adding another

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.190 
the left hand still only adding another
octave<00:03:27.459> so<00:03:27.940> you'd<00:03:28.150> have<00:03:30.750> you'd<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.870> starting

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
octave so you'd have you'd be starting

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:44.520 
octave so you'd have you'd be starting
out<00:03:32.350> with<00:03:34.260> two<00:03:35.260> different<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:42.270> so<00:03:43.270> be<00:03:44.050> two<00:03:44.319> days

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
out with two different so so be two days

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.550 
out with two different so so be two days
and<00:03:45.040> then<00:03:45.400> you'll<00:03:45.760> be<00:03:45.790> doing<00:03:46.350> pretty<00:03:47.350> much<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and then you'll be doing pretty much the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.180 
and then you'll be doing pretty much the
same<00:03:47.770> thing<00:03:48.010> over<00:03:48.100> here<00:03:48.190> except<00:03:48.610> f<00:03:49.330> ec<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:51.040> it'd

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
same thing over here except f ec so it'd

00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:03.570 
same thing over here except f ec so it'd
be<00:03:51.220> like<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:58.600> see<00:03:58.810> fa<00:03:59.410> sho<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.010> then<00:04:03.190> going

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
be like so you see fa sho and then going

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.140 
be like so you see fa sho and then going
back<00:04:03.790> down<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.840> G<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:07.530> then<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:08.739> just<00:04:08.920> go

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
back down to the G and then you just go

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.309 
back down to the G and then you just go
and<00:04:10.629> then<00:04:10.750> do<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.870> would<00:04:14.050> end<00:04:14.260> up

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
and then do that so it would end up

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:24.330 
and then do that so it would end up
light<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.410> then<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:24.010> would<00:04:24.130> end<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.280> doing

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
light and then you would end up doing

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.920 
light and then you would end up doing
that<00:04:24.580> again<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:32.910> right<00:04:33.910> hand<00:04:34.150> same

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
that again like the right hand same

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.469 
that again like the right hand same
thing<00:04:35.199> it<00:04:35.380> when<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.650> comes<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:36.100> and

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.520 

that's<00:04:40.500> pretty<00:04:41.500> much<00:04:41.710> all<00:04:41.979> I<00:04:42.100> know<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.810> but
