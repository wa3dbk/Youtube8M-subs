00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.220 

I've<00:01:21.620> got<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.800> bit<00:01:21.980> slower<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.900> blower's

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
I've got a bit slower the blower's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.190 
I've got a bit slower the blower's
high-sticking<00:01:24.950> or<00:01:25.250> no<00:01:25.540> face<00:01:26.540> growing<00:01:26.810> as<00:01:27.170> we

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
high-sticking or no face growing as we

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.120 
high-sticking or no face growing as we
would<00:01:27.800> say<00:01:27.950> that's<00:01:28.160> not<00:01:28.280> fair<00:01:29.830> no<00:01:30.830> blowing

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
would say that's not fair no blowing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.630 
would say that's not fair no blowing
above<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.640> waist<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.300> for<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:33.200> matter

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
above the waist that is for that matter

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.880 
above the waist that is for that matter
and<00:01:34.640> their<00:01:35.120> gold<00:01:35.330> pendants<00:01:35.720> no<00:01:36.320> goaltenders

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
and their gold pendants no goaltenders

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.770 
and their gold pendants no goaltenders
that's<00:01:37.040> important<00:01:37.430> because<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.450> hard<00:01:38.690> to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
that's important because it is hard to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.969 
that's important because it is hard to
score<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> tough<00:01:39.410> game<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.650> play<00:01:39.890> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
score it's a tough game to play and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:49.040
