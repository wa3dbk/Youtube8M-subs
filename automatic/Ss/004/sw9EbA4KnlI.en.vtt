content first both are almost exactly
the<00:01:47.850> same<00:01:47.880> now

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.840 

and<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.570> iphone<00:01:53.900> 3gs<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.650> done<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.549> Nexus

and the iphone 3gs is done and the Nexus

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.399 
and the iphone 3gs is done and the Nexus
One<00:01:55.880> finished<00:01:56.390> just<00:01:56.509> a<00:01:56.570> second<00:01:56.900> or<00:01:56.990> two<00:01:57.170> after

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
One finished just a second or two after

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.679 
One finished just a second or two after
that<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.400> they<00:01:58.490> were<00:01:58.580> both<00:01:58.729> pretty<00:01:59.119> close<00:01:59.509> but

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
that so they were both pretty close but

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.539 
that so they were both pretty close but
the<00:01:59.810> iPhone<00:01:59.930> definitely<00:02:00.650> won<00:02:00.920> although<00:02:01.340> not

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
the iPhone definitely won although not

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.440 
the iPhone definitely won although not
by<00:02:01.790> much

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.120 
by much
okay<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.170> now<00:02:03.409> we're<00:02:03.530> going<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.710> travel<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.070> up

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
loaded them up significantly faster so I

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.039 
loaded them up significantly faster so I
wanted<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.910> see<00:02:56.060> if<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.239> was<00:02:56.569> due<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.810> a

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
wanted to see if that was due to a

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.620 
wanted to see if that was due to a
faster<00:02:57.620> t-mobile<00:02:58.130> network<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:59.209> perhaps<00:02:59.360> that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
faster t-mobile network or perhaps that

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.240 
faster t-mobile network or perhaps that
could<00:02:59.750> be<00:02:59.840> attributed<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.500> faster

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.660 
processor let's go ahead and check it
out<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.380> ran<00:03:03.470> these<00:03:03.799> tests<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.280> little<00:03:04.549> bit

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
out so I ran these tests a little bit

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.870 
out so I ran these tests a little bit
earlier<00:03:05.060> over<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.290> t-mobile<00:03:06.680> 3G<00:03:07.280> network<00:03:07.670> I

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
earlier over the t-mobile 3G network I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.020 
earlier over the t-mobile 3G network I
averaged<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.420> about<00:03:09.459> 304<00:03:10.459> kilobits<00:03:10.940> per

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
getting over 600 kilobits per second so

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.270 
getting over 600 kilobits per second so
almost<00:03:17.209> twice<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.810> fast<00:03:18.109> but<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.769> increased

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
almost twice as fast but that increased

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.949 
almost twice as fast but that increased
network<00:03:19.670> speed<00:03:19.880> wasn't<00:03:20.209> translating<00:03:20.810> to

network speed wasn't translating to

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
faster load times so I have to attribute

it to the Brody upgraded hardware that's

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.520 
it to the Brody upgraded hardware that's

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
ramming the Nexus One it's got a 400

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
megahertz faster processor and the ramen

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.500 
megahertz faster processor and the ramen
ramen<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:30.829> quite<00:03:31.250> fast<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.299> pretty

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.270 
ramen it is quite fast and a pretty
ample<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.470> think<00:03:33.590> that's<00:03:33.859> really<00:03:34.160> the

ample so I think that's really the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.680 
ample so I think that's really the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.690 
difference between it behind the Nexus
ones<00:03:35.900> increased<00:03:36.440> load<00:03:36.680> times<00:03:36.890> next

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.120
