and this thing right snipers so I saw on

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.190 
and this thing right snipers so I saw on
what<00:00:39.640> my<00:00:39.730> classes<00:00:40.180> I<00:00:40.270> decided<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.690> use<00:00:40.900> it<00:00:41.080> and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
what my classes I decided to use it and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.460 
what my classes I decided to use it and
I<00:00:41.980> really<00:00:42.820> wasn't<00:00:43.090> too<00:00:43.480> sure<00:00:43.720> how<00:00:43.750> good<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.290> was

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
I really wasn't too sure how good it was

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.080 
I really wasn't too sure how good it was
I<00:00:44.830> mean<00:00:44.980> people<00:00:45.160> didn't<00:00:45.490> really<00:00:45.670> use<00:00:45.880> it

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
I mean people didn't really use it

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.710 
I mean people didn't really use it
because<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.470> it's<00:00:47.650> only<00:00:48.070> four<00:00:48.430> bullets<00:00:48.940> they

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
because of it's only four bullets they

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.630 
because of it's only four bullets they
can<00:00:49.960> shoot<00:00:50.320> before<00:00:50.500> they<00:00:50.620> reload<00:00:50.800> but<00:00:51.340> here

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
can shoot before they reload but here

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.060 
can shoot before they reload but here
I'm<00:00:51.820> like<00:00:52.330> this<00:00:52.720> is<00:00:52.870> where<00:00:53.080> I<00:00:53.110> start<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.620> get

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
it's just my opinion I'm knowing what

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.910 
it's just my opinion I'm knowing what
you<00:02:36.670> guys<00:02:36.760> think<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.170> I'm<00:02:38.170> commentating<00:02:38.830> this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
so I'm gonna say what I think and I

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.350 
so I'm gonna say what I think and I
don't<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.610> care<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:42.940> guys<00:02:43.030> say<00:02:43.090> this

don't like care what you guys say this
is<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.599> think<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.730> think<00:02:46.480> taking

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
is I think and it's that I think taking

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.930 
is I think and it's that I think taking
gaming<00:02:47.319> seriously<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:48.690> bad<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:50.739> do<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.190> don't

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
gaming seriously is bad to do I don't

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.420 
gaming seriously is bad to do I don't
think<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.330> take<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.540> too<00:02:52.750> seriously<00:02:53.430> but

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
think you can take it too seriously but

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.150 
think you can take it too seriously but
I<00:02:54.730> think<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.569> definitely<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:56.319> some

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
I think you can definitely have some

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.640 
I think you can definitely have some
seriousness<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.329> guess<00:02:58.510> kind<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.500> like

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
seriousness in it I guess kind of like

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.880 
seriousness in it I guess kind of like
what<00:03:00.099> I<00:03:00.130> do<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.239> have<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.450> mix<00:03:01.780> where<00:03:02.709> it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
what I do I think I have a mix where it

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.640 
what I do I think I have a mix where it
is<00:03:03.069> um<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.700> kind<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.810> wrangle<00:03:05.349> like<00:03:05.440> this

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
is um I kind of wrangle like this

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.650 
is um I kind of wrangle like this
sniping<00:03:06.160> sniping<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.790> stuff<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.209> don't<00:03:07.480> take

a party you always kind of try hard just
because<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.739> either<00:03:27.459> because<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.540> don't<00:03:28.750> want

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.420 
because I either because you don't want
to<00:03:29.049> make<00:03:29.170> yourself<00:03:29.500> look<00:03:29.560> bad<00:03:29.769> by<00:03:29.980> putting<00:03:30.340> up

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
to make yourself look bad by putting up

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.030 
to make yourself look bad by putting up
a<00:03:30.489> really<00:03:30.819> crappy<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.150> score<00:03:31.410> or<00:03:32.410> maybe<00:03:32.799> it's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
a really crappy to score or maybe it's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.770 
a really crappy to score or maybe it's
just<00:03:33.160> because<00:03:33.609> as<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.000> team<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.480> find<00:03:34.660> it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
just because as a team you find it

was<00:03:46.480> saying<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:47.230> think<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:48.160> take<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.090> game

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
was saying I think I take the game

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.340 
was saying I think I take the game
seriously<00:03:49.799> when<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.950> should<00:03:51.160> be<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:52.239> I'll<00:03:53.139> be

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
seriously when it should be like I'll be

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.840 
seriously when it should be like I'll be
kind<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.590> messing<00:03:53.859> around<00:03:53.950> not<00:03:54.400> taking<00:03:54.670> too

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
kind of messing around not taking too

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.660 
kind of messing around not taking too
seriously<00:03:55.299> because<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:56.230> course<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:57.459> never

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
seriously because of course it's never

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.379 
seriously because of course it's never
good<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.150> get<00:03:58.269> angry<00:03:58.720> at<00:03:58.959> an<00:03:59.139> Xbox<00:03:59.560> game<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:01.150> s

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
good to get angry at an Xbox game that s

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.990 
good to get angry at an Xbox game that s
just<00:04:01.599> foolish<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:03.040> then<00:04:03.160> I'm<00:04:03.310> unless<00:04:03.760> you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
just foolish but then I'm unless you

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.470 
just foolish but then I'm unless you
like<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.480> hardcore<00:04:05.200> GB<00:04:05.680> player<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.269> your<00:04:07.269> game

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
like a hardcore GB player and your game

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.259 
like a hardcore GB player and your game
battles<00:04:07.810> if<00:04:07.989> you<00:04:08.049> don't<00:04:08.170> know<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:09.269> unless

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
battles if you don't know that is unless

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:10.949 
battles if you don't know that is unless
you're<00:04:10.420> one<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.599> them

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
you're one of them

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.460 
you're one of them
then<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.620> think<00:04:11.950> any<00:04:12.880> make<00:04:13.090> money<00:04:13.359> off<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.569> like

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
then I think any make money off it like

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.390 
then I think any make money off it like
say<00:04:14.829> my<00:04:15.040> channel<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:15.669> had<00:04:16.680> 20k<00:04:17.680> subs<00:04:17.979> or<00:04:18.220> so

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
say my channel here had 20k subs or so

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.520 
say my channel here had 20k subs or so
and<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.639> you're<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.970> partner<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:20.349> made

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
and I you're the partner and I made

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.980 
and I you're the partner and I made
money<00:04:20.709> off<00:04:21.039> of<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.510> then<00:04:22.510> I<00:04:22.539> might<00:04:22.750> start

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
money off of this then I might start

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.380 
money off of this then I might start
trying<00:04:23.260> hard<00:04:23.500> because<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:24.220> would<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.520> that

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
trying hard because that would just that

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.370 
trying hard because that would just that
would<00:04:25.479> make<00:04:25.720> me<00:04:25.870> try<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.140> get<00:04:26.289> better

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
would make me try to get better

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.780 
would make me try to get better
gameplays<00:04:26.890> and<00:04:26.919> do

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
gameplays and do

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.300 
gameplays and do
Terri's<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.420> better<00:04:28.740> montage<00:04:29.740> edits<00:04:30.190> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
Terri's and better montage edits and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.330 
Terri's and better montage edits and
that<00:04:30.460> kind<00:04:30.640> of<00:04:30.670> stuff<00:04:30.880> but<00:04:31.620> from<00:04:32.620> here<00:04:32.890> at<00:04:33.190> this

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
that kind of stuff but from here at this

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.850 
that kind of stuff but from here at this
point<00:04:34.020> it's<00:04:35.020> not<00:04:35.260> all<00:04:35.440> about<00:04:35.530> taking

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
point it's not all about taking

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.110 
point it's not all about taking
seriously<00:04:36.220> it's<00:04:36.340> more<00:04:36.430> having<00:04:36.700> fun<00:04:36.880> with<00:04:37.000> it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
seriously it's more having fun with it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.840 
seriously it's more having fun with it
and<00:04:37.720> unless<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.890> start<00:04:39.130> making<00:04:39.310> money<00:04:39.550> I

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
and unless you start making money I

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.520 
and unless you start making money I
don't<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:40.930> it's<00:04:41.020> something<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.380> should

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
don't think it's something you should

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.800 
don't think it's something you should
take<00:04:41.620> extremely<00:04:42.070> seriously<00:04:42.450> now<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.480> know<00:04:43.720> a

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
take extremely seriously now I know a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.620 
take extremely seriously now I know a
bunch<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.140> people<00:04:44.200> who<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:45.280> kind<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.390> do

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
bunch of people who just kind of do

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.400 
bunch of people who just kind of do
their<00:04:46.810> own<00:04:46.840> thing<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:48.270> they<00:04:49.270> get<00:04:49.570> cool<00:04:50.140> little

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
their own thing and they get cool little

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.830 
their own thing and they get cool little
kills<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.610> when<00:04:51.790> there's<00:04:52.150> not<00:04:52.360> caring<00:04:52.750> or

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
kills and when there's not caring or

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.780 
kills and when there's not caring or
anything<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.860> they<00:04:54.190> make<00:04:54.310> money<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.580> of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
anything and they make money off of

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.570 
anything and they make money off of
youtube<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:55.750> think<00:04:56.380> that's<00:04:56.770> one<00:04:56.950> route<00:04:57.250> one

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
youtube so I think that's one route one

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.090 
youtube so I think that's one route one
route<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.270> could<00:04:58.390> take<00:04:58.600> or<00:04:58.870> just<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.500> little

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
route you could take or just a little

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.240 
route you could take or just a little
weird<00:05:00.220> framerate<00:05:00.700> issue<00:05:01.110> that's<00:05:02.110> weird<00:05:02.350> but

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
weird framerate issue that's weird but

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.460 
weird framerate issue that's weird but
yeah<00:05:03.490> RPG<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.270> 15<00:05:04.780> kilo<00:05:04.960> speak<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:05.320> then<00:05:05.410> I

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
yeah RPG a 15 kilo speak and then I

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.320 
yeah RPG a 15 kilo speak and then I
think<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.860> keep<00:05:06.100> going<00:05:06.280> here<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.700> just<00:05:07.120> kind<00:05:07.270> of

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
think I keep going here I just kind of

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.150 
think I keep going here I just kind of
chill<00:05:07.540> up<00:05:07.660> in<00:05:07.780> this<00:05:07.870> top<00:05:08.140> area<00:05:08.410> and<00:05:08.830> just<00:05:08.980> do

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160

chill up in this top area and just do
work<00:05:10.290> yeah<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.530> mean<00:05:11.740> that's<00:05:11.830> my<00:05:12.070> take<00:05:12.310> I'm

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430

taking<00:05:12.760> gaming<00:05:13.030> seriously<00:05:13.480> I<00:05:13.510> think<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.870> can

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
taking gaming seriously I think you can

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.970 
taking gaming seriously I think you can
really<00:05:15.790> get<00:05:15.850> a<00:05:15.910> party<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.360> stuff<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.980> like

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
really get a party and stuff and like

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.380 
really get a party and stuff and like
you<00:05:18.100> kind<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.370> like<00:05:18.520> it's<00:05:18.700> like<00:05:18.730> late<00:05:19.060> at<00:05:19.090> night

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
you kind of like it's like late at night

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.970 
you kind of like it's like late at night
and<00:05:19.600> you're<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.840> chilling<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.530> your<00:05:20.650> seat

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
and you're just chilling and your seat

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.860 
and you're just chilling and your seat
lights<00:05:21.490> off<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.030> stuff<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.390> just<00:05:22.450> kind<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.750> in

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
lights off and stuff and just kind of in

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.810 
lights off and stuff and just kind of in
the<00:05:22.900> zone<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.440> think<00:05:24.010> that's<00:05:24.430> when<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.700> might

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
the zone I think that's when you might

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.000 
the zone I think that's when you might
want<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.970> take<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.180> seriously<00:05:25.540> I<00:05:25.890> mean<00:05:26.890> it

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
want to take it seriously I mean it

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.190 
want to take it seriously I mean it
can't<00:05:27.190> hurt<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.790> might<00:05:28.510> want<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.780> win<00:05:28.960> and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
can't hurt you might want to win and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.140 
can't hurt you might want to win and
stuff<00:05:29.350> like<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:30.010> kind<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.220> stuff<00:05:30.370> but<00:05:30.940> in<00:05:31.060> my

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
stuff like that kind of stuff but in my

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.350 
stuff like that kind of stuff but in my
opinion<00:05:31.620> once<00:05:32.620> again<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.310> mean<00:05:33.880> I<00:05:33.940> think<00:05:34.090> you

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
opinion once again I mean I think you
