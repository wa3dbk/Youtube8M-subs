class<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.509> are<00:00:06.540> migrating<00:00:07.109> into<00:00:07.259> still<00:00:08.069> higher

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
class we are migrating into still higher

class<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.690> UAVs<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.580> we<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:11.820> gone<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.179> for

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
class of UAVs and we are now gone in for

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.450 
class of UAVs and we are now gone in for
what<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.540> called<00:00:12.900> as<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> rhythm<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.920> this

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
what is called as a rhythm one and this

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
what is called as a rhythm one and this
is<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> stepping<00:00:15.269> stone<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.900> major

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
is the stepping stone for the major

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800 
is the stepping stone for the major
project<00:00:17.400> which<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.670> upcoming<00:00:18.060> nadie<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.690> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
project which is upcoming nadie that is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.250 
project which is upcoming nadie that is
the<00:00:18.990> system<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.810> used<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> one

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the system so here we had used the one

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.689 
the system so here we had used the one
like<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> one<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> existing<00:00:23.279> platform

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
like the one of the existing platform

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.589 
like the one of the existing platform
that<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:25.039> long<00:00:26.039> his<00:00:26.220> aircraft<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.510> are

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that is long his aircraft and we are

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
that is long his aircraft and we are
converted<00:00:28.019> into<00:00:28.140> totally<00:00:28.590> unmanned<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
converted into totally unmanned and this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
converted into totally unmanned and this
can<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.510> flown<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.170> endurance<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.740> more

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
conventional takeoff and landing I just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.139 
conventional takeoff and landing I just
show<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> small<00:00:43.170> clipping<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:44.430> flight

working on these technologies and it

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.160 
working on these technologies and it
will<00:01:58.190> have<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.460> payloads<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
will have the payloads that is the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.030 
will have the payloads that is the
electro-optic<00:02:00.830> payload<00:02:01.190> with<00:02:02.560> three<00:02:03.560> sensors

electro-optic payload with three sensors
and<00:02:04.340> also<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.060> allows<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.420> signal

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
and also it allows the signal

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.230 
and also it allows the signal
intelligence<00:02:06.250> ellington<00:02:07.250> comment<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.790> the

intelligence ellington comment and the
radar<00:02:08.420> payloads<00:02:08.929> either<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.800> synthetic

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
radar payloads either the synthetic

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.030 
radar payloads either the synthetic
aperture<00:02:10.340> radar<00:02:10.610> or<00:02:11.060> mpr<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.440> also<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:12.830> love

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
aperture radar or mpr and also we love

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.400 
aperture radar or mpr and also we love
that<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.150> situational<00:02:14.690> awareness<00:02:14.780> payloads

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that the situational awareness payloads

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.850 
that the situational awareness payloads
like<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.100> f<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.730> T<00:02:17.060> gas<00:02:17.270> etcetera<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.020> declare

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
like I f of T gas etcetera and declare

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.640 
like I f of T gas etcetera and declare
to<00:02:19.040> wideband<00:02:19.630> downlink<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.170> narrow<00:02:21.410> bank

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
to wideband downlink and one narrow bank

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.710 
to wideband downlink and one narrow bank
so<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.460> multiple<00:02:22.880> payloads<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.570> be

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
so that the multiple payloads can be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.350 
so that the multiple payloads can be
operated<00:02:24.380> simultaneously<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.180> new

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
operated simultaneously and this new

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.590 
operated simultaneously and this new
project<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.020> we<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:27.739> going<00:02:27.980> for<00:02:28.010> a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
project and we are going for a

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.670 
project and we are going for a
collaboration<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.780> international

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
collaboration in international

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760 
collaboration in international
collaboration<00:02:31.640> limited<00:02:32.270> v<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.410> these<00:02:33.590> are<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
collaboration limited v so these are the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.760 
collaboration limited v so these are the
