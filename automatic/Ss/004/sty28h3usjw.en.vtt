00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
of the founders of mass fidelity and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.589 
of the founders of mass fidelity and
we're<00:00:26.970> showing<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.480> CES<00:00:27.930> 2015<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.310> core<00:00:29.640> which

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
we're showing at CES 2015 the core which

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
we're showing at CES 2015 the core which
is<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.140> compact<00:00:31.800> wireless<00:00:32.309> speaker<00:00:32.640> system

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
is a compact wireless speaker system

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.360 
is a compact wireless speaker system
that<00:00:33.300> sounds<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.079> full<00:00:34.410> stereo<00:00:34.800> system

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that sounds like a full stereo system

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
that sounds like a full stereo system
you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.969> hold<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.570> hand<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.530> got<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you can hold it in your hand it's got a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.459 
you can hold it in your hand it's got a
12<00:00:38.160> hour<00:00:38.309> battery<00:00:38.579> life<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.270> does<00:00:39.899> multi<00:00:40.290> room

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
12 hour battery life it does multi room

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.750 
12 hour battery life it does multi room
with<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> press<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> button<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.489> don't

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
with the press of a button you don't

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.860 
with the press of a button you don't
need<00:00:41.879> any<00:00:42.030> apps<00:00:42.270> anything<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.370> but

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
need any apps anything like that but

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.819 
need any apps anything like that but
here<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.020> have<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.739> analog<00:00:47.700> inputs<00:00:48.829> digital

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
here you have the analog inputs digital

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.360 
here you have the analog inputs digital
inputs<00:00:50.449> control<00:00:51.449> inputs<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
inputs control inputs if you want to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
inputs control inputs if you want to
control<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.910> home<00:00:54.059> automation<00:00:54.239> system

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
control it from a home automation system

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.720 
control it from a home automation system
natively<00:00:55.879> it's<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> bluetooth<00:00:57.600> input<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
natively it's got a bluetooth input and

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.900 
natively it's got a bluetooth input and
the<00:00:59.730> big<00:00:59.910> difference<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.920> core<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the big difference in the core is how it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
the big difference in the core is how it
renders<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> sound<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> computer

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
renders the sound so there's a computer

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
renders the sound so there's a computer
that's<00:01:04.830> built<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.760> runs<00:01:05.970> an

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that's built into it that runs an

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.780 
that's built into it that runs an
algorithm<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> allows<00:01:07.140> us<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.010> create<00:01:08.159> real

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
algorithm that allows us to create real

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.899 
algorithm that allows us to create real
true<00:01:09.360> better<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.229> stereo<00:01:10.710> sound<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
true better than stereo sound from this

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
true better than stereo sound from this
tiny<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.479> box<00:01:12.810> it'll<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.740> available<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
tiny little box it'll be available in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.460 
tiny little box it'll be available in
May<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.590> 2015<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> cost<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.820> 599<00:01:18.810> US<00:01:19.229> dollars

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
May of 2015 at a cost of 599 US dollars

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.020 
May of 2015 at a cost of 599 US dollars
so<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.520> mentioned<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.909> previous

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
so as I have mentioned in previous

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.600 
so as I have mentioned in previous
videos<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> big<00:01:25.860> fan<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.189> actually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
videos I'm not a big fan of actually

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
videos I'm not a big fan of actually
trying<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.880> capture<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.570> audio<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.470> sound

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
trying to capture the audio from a sound

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.219 
trying to capture the audio from a sound
system<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.369> share<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.390> YouTube<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.900> don't

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
system and share it on YouTube I don't

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
system and share it on YouTube I don't
think<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.680> does<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.070> good<00:01:32.369> system<00:01:32.759> justice<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
think it does a good system justice so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.670 
think it does a good system justice so
we're<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> but<00:01:34.650> i

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
we're not going to do that but i

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.109 
we're not going to do that but i
actually<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.100> had<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> opportunity<00:01:36.000> for

it spread out through different speakers
with<00:02:00.960> different<00:02:01.320> music<00:02:01.439> depending<00:02:01.979> upon

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
with different music depending upon

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520 
with different music depending upon
who's<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.479> say<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:04.229> is
