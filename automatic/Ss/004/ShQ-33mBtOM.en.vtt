00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 today is the chant of manicure 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.310
 I saw a lot of crimes against humanity 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.210
 special thank you hand-sewn 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.079
 she who come 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:10.739
 move 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.849
 it's a secret all parties want to believe 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.519
 much higher than all of 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 I pay emirs a little better 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 so leave the two-wheelers 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.280
 certainly the merits of the last hooded taken a red chanel 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.399
 would not she be a robot 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:31.729
 it's so cool 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.819
 the sprinter rougemont at the port of course 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.720
 Maxppp 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
 what his wheels 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 and then you will see the technique 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.860
 you do not have to put everything in the game and you have to dose well 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.070
 a heavy but they the amount of yaoundÃ© 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 so I'll try to make sure you see 2 0 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.840
 The lowest prices 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.060
 so nothing 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.220
 we were not particularly flat otherwise 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.640
 because otherwise I do not want to taste it yes it's called period 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.550
 or flat 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.180
 you are not at the base 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.260
 in short a little bit after you preferred 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.800
 good maybe not right and again 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.410
 more than a point in auxerre 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.410
 for paris for others 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 forster when they enter like this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.130
 here are the results 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.640
 I'm telling you 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 he took a form actually 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.640
 so to start 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.440
 here is the afp so what I will have me perso 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.670
 but hyper covered 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.250
 so far this side has been done to the point 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.170
 aNTANANARIVO 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 nantes mam comes to complain 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.950
 we let a little better 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.510
 we are very proud 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.040
 to exploit a little 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.580
 in the dark 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 whose act 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.499
 a course of the ally 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.719
 and when we overflow a little 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.719
 but I'm looking for I'm here 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.509
 top 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.309
 slim so it's first a pc 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:21.839
 as for reflexes 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.839
 their repertoire 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.109
 I tell you she does especially when do you have the choice to have killed 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.569
 two little trolls 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.569
 of the hillside crisis that will pick up alongside those who are soft 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.159
 first let it dry 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.919
 you can continue afp 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.919
 to make us admit that others that's what I'm going to do 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.799
 so I continue 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.799
 Like nothing ever happened 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.799
 and then I wait for it to be dry 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.139
 for the time not have time 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.209
 five teams from the top of the board 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.309
 a plant 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.309
 we take the example of m 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:04.739
 goals only 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.479
 on the side more 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
 and you go piracy 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.839
 after a few details 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.049
 do not travel to alain 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.349
 schoolchildren 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.189
 it's pretty good 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:22.799
 so after 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.529
 when will you have when I retire 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.529
 you can find them by clicking here necessarily concerned about 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.659
 cards a little to the skin 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:31.959
 in the Loire 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.959
 atmosphere like party with elected and cotton buds 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.719
 and it works by itself 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.159
 So here is 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.439
 cpe 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.819
 how to apply locks and slip soccer everywhere 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.189
 I do not do all my fingers 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.989
 same for all
