 sirens and squeaks of tires that come with a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 downhill walk through the bend over the intersection 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.850
 popping

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.790
 I broke up and the stick fell 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.320
 to the ground 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.210

 out loud what the hell is going on 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.079

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 riots broke out or a bomb attack and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.750
