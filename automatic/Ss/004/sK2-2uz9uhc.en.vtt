00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.040
 they shine in black and white next to each other 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.170
 us the new models from the stage 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.730
 custom verge series and mine is 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.500
 wolfgang john terry who betrayed us 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.349
 what the new thing is 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.599
 drums hello wolfgang lina new 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.220
 at the stage custom the stage custom 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.960
 we have been around for about 20 years 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.460
 many drummers on the market 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.159
 will scan it is the hustler 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.300
 celebrate 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:31.489
 we have in this year's version 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.379
 We have changed a lot of work 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.149
 For example, we start with the base 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.160
 it's all rubber now 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.410
 and done the same here 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.149
 the tom bracket here even the 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.649
 patches and even the air holes it is 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.449
 actually everything is subject to rubber 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.210
 So that really no noise 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.250
 there are more 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.170
 we have changed a lot on the boiler 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.960
 Boiler the boiler itself is like 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.399
 birch before 100% birch the layers of 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.559
 but have become a little thicker so 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.070
 that the boiler is also something altogether 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.539
 has become thicker and we have with 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.100
 the boiler advice the work kassel 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.650
 this is just the edge of the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 So boiler where you put the kettle 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.230
 Of course then cuts off 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.690
 definitely be called the sanding 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.010
 the advice we have there 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.450
 some drumming in the teams 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.370
 For example, they are just a bit sharper 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 made and at the base jump something 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.760
 rounder so that more falls I hang up 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.760
 can just hurry in here 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.980
 it finds bird space jam in size 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 really enormous pressure 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.900
 yes many many little things small 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.190
 details we have changed and that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.080
 told me because that's more you have 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.780
 also what changed the snare drum is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.640
 I believe in the price range but what 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 actually almost unique that has 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.580
 Now ten spans can be screwed 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.190
 thereby adjust very fine and birch 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.730
 snow jam with the specs we have now 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.960
 to offer 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.150
 in the price class is I think 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
 really unique in the market so 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.040
 a whole lot new as far as the sound is concerned 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.060
 what was changed on the one hand and 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.590
 but then we have too 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.180
 yet a new I'd say 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.880
 Packaging concept so we offer now 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.729
 the date custom for the first time as a shell 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.380
 set of so only the drums in a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.480
 carton in which all the drums are in it 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.830
 and you can either buy it that way if 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 you already have hardware or something 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.480
 want to complete or you can 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.230
 we offer the one -lane 700s 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.150
 hardware 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.530
 or you just can shop in 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.570
 The double city eternal hardware as well 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.480
 take here 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.500
 and yes or maybe somehow 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.510
 as I said on his old hardware 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.810
 resort to individual components 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.489
 So take it exactly and be happy 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.420
 Dealer when transporting the compact 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.850
 can be right 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.959
 yes , I think we will be the first 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.310
 few hours now here from the fair 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.420
 show that we are using the sketch casting 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.920
 I think I did a very good job 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.030
 This year we are very curious how 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.220
 the feedback will fail 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.220
 Thank you, we say goodbye to her for now
