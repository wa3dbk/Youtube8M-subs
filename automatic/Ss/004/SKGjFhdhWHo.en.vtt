00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
have to do is not the whole you know I
would<00:01:14.369> recommend<00:01:14.820> using<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.240> 1<00:01:15.420> inch<00:01:16.549> 3/4<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.670> 1

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
would recommend using a 1 inch 3/4 to 1

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.320 
would recommend using a 1 inch 3/4 to 1
inch<00:01:18.560> Spade<00:01:19.560> blade<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.759> had<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> half<00:01:21.180> an

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
inch Spade blade I only had a half an

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630 
inch Spade blade I only had a half an
inch<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> did<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
inch so what I did is I just kind of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
inch so what I did is I just kind of
rounded<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.299> fit<00:01:24.810> everything<00:01:25.049> through

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
rounded it out fit everything through

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.240 
rounded it out fit everything through
and<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> might<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.220> just

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and you might have to take this off just

and you might have to take this off just
temporarily<00:01:29.939> we're<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.270> place<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> back

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
temporarily we're gonna place this back

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.469 
temporarily we're gonna place this back
on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> regular<00:01:32.310> plug<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> ballast

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
on the regular plug here for the ballast

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.380 
on the regular plug here for the ballast
and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.110 
the power for the relay this is the
trigger<00:02:20.410> point<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.940> trigger

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
trigger point that's going to trigger

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.490 
trigger point that's going to trigger
the<00:02:22.330> lights<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.170> trigger<00:02:23.319> this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
the lights it's going to trigger this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.640 
the lights it's going to trigger this
relay<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:25.569> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.900> send<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.500> power

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
relay and I'm going to send the power

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.550 
relay and I'm going to send the power
down<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.550> ballast<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.170> actually

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
down to the ballast and this is actually

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.979 
down to the ballast and this is actually
a<00:02:29.620> direct<00:02:29.739> draw<00:02:30.130> off<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.430> batteries<00:02:30.880> so

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
a direct draw off the batteries so

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.809 
a direct draw off the batteries so
that's<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.380> wires<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.370> then<00:02:33.580> this

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
that's what that wires for and then this

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.870 
that's what that wires for and then this
is<00:02:34.030> mr.<00:02:34.540> sorry<00:02:35.470> about<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.370> kinda

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
is mr. sorry about this and just kinda

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.940 
is mr. sorry about this and just kinda
soldering<00:02:37.239> us<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:38.019> realize<00:02:38.410> how<00:02:38.590> much<00:02:38.709> time

soldering us you realize how much time

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.539 
soldering us you realize how much time
it's<00:02:39.220> going<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> take<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.890> going<00:02:42.459> to

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
it's going to take and this is going to

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.460 
it's going to take and this is going to
be<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> ground<00:02:43.000> lead<00:02:43.239> I'm<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.049> also

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
be the ground lead I'm going to also

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.280 
be the ground lead I'm going to also
apply<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.970> gonna<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.540> stem<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.049> wire

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
apply I'm gonna have to stem this wire

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.440 
apply I'm gonna have to stem this wire
of<00:02:47.560> course<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.130> battery<00:02:48.489> and<00:02:48.700> then<00:02:49.239> this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
of course to the battery and then this

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
of course to the battery and then this
one's<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.870> going<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.290> reach<00:02:50.650> right<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
one's is going to reach right to the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160 
one's is going to reach right to the
ground<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.519> I'm<00:02:51.610> going<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.790> put<00:02:52.000> nice<00:02:52.600> little

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
ground and I'm going to put nice little

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.729 
ground and I'm going to put nice little
connectors<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.860> there<00:02:54.329> I<00:02:55.329> also<00:02:55.870> used<00:02:56.230> heat

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
connectors on there I also used heat

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.270 
connectors on there I also used heat

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
joints were nice and seal from

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.140 
joints were nice and seal from
environment<00:03:11.050> because<00:03:11.350> as<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.610> knowing<00:03:12.940> being

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
environment because as you knowing being

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
environment because as you knowing being
having<00:03:14.050> headlights<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.770> going<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.190> be<00:03:15.340> an

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
having headlights is going to be an

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.010 
having headlights is going to be an
environmentally<00:03:16.690> rough<00:03:16.960> thing<00:03:17.230> for

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
environmentally rough thing for

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.130 
environmentally rough thing for
lollipops<00:03:20.020> so<00:03:20.700> I'm<00:03:21.700> not<00:03:21.910> going<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.530> assemble

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
lollipops so I'm not going to assemble

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.290 
lollipops so I'm not going to assemble
I'm<00:03:26.140> not<00:03:26.320> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.710> solder<00:03:27.310> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.120> other

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
I'm not going to solder in the other

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.880 
I'm not going to solder in the other
part<00:03:28.630> until<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.990> get<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.320> bolts<00:03:29.590> back<00:03:29.830> in

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
part until I get the bolts back in

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.570 
part until I get the bolts back in
because<00:03:30.460> it's<00:03:31.270> going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> happen<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.960> be<00:03:32.110> that

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
because it's going to happen to be that

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.010 
because it's going to happen to be that
it's<00:03:33.580> not<00:03:33.910> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.210> go<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.510> right<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
it's not going to go in right so so I

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's not going to go in right so so I
have<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.950> also<00:03:39.070> install<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.790> ballast<00:03:40.150> which<00:03:40.750> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
have to also install the ballast which I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.230 
have to also install the ballast which I
have<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.200> go<00:03:41.290> outside<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.620> do<00:03:41.890> first<00:03:42.250> before

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
have to go outside and do first before

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.580 
have to go outside and do first before
anything<00:03:43.840> else<00:03:43.990> too

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
anything else too

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.280 
anything else too
so<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.100> have<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.400> find<00:03:45.640> an<00:03:45.790> area<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.390> it's<00:03:46.990> like

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
so I have to find an area and it's like

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.530 
so I have to find an area and it's like
nighttime<00:03:47.710> now<00:03:48.100> it's<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.400> 10<00:03:49.000> o'clock<00:03:49.210> at

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
nighttime now it's like 10 o'clock at

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.290 
nighttime now it's like 10 o'clock at
night<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.650> bought<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> light<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.580> be<00:03:52.030> able<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
night so I bought a light to be able to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.220 
night so I bought a light to be able to
work<00:03:52.600> out<00:03:52.780> in<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.680> dark<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.360> once<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:56.110> get

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
work out in the dark and so once we get

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.340 
work out in the dark and so once we get
these<00:03:56.410> installed<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.750> going<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.990> be<00:03:59.110> really

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
these installed it's going to be really

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.110 
these installed it's going to be really
nice<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.740> be<00:03:59.800> able<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.070> see<00:04:00.310> cuz<00:04:00.550> it's<00:04:00.730> right<00:04:00.970> at

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
nice to be able to see cuz it's right at

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.540 
nice to be able to see cuz it's right at
night<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.660> it's<00:04:01.780> perfect<00:04:02.260> now<00:04:02.830> I<00:04:03.160> might<00:04:03.520> have

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
night so it's perfect now I might have

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.360 
night so it's perfect now I might have
to<00:04:03.870> readjust<00:04:04.870> these<00:04:05.350> lights<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.220> see

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
to readjust these lights as you see

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.310 
to readjust these lights as you see
these<00:04:06.550> bolts<00:04:06.940> here<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.750> have<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.990> move<00:04:08.140> these

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
these bolts here you have to move these

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.140 
these bolts here you have to move these
in<00:04:08.710> and<00:04:08.980> out<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:10.840> here<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.940> heads

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
in and out right here because the heads

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.140 
in and out right here because the heads
have<00:04:13.270> different<00:04:13.900> light<00:04:14.170> consistencies<00:04:15.040> so<00:04:15.700> we

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
have different light consistencies so we

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.870 
have different light consistencies so we
don't<00:04:16.270> want<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.480> blind<00:04:16.660> people<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.170> road

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
don't want to blind people on the road

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.310 
don't want to blind people on the road
hopefully<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.420> just<00:04:19.690> pop<00:04:19.930> them<00:04:20.109> back<00:04:20.260> in

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
hopefully I can just pop them back in

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.620 
hopefully I can just pop them back in
and<00:04:20.770> everything<00:04:21.520> will<00:04:21.640> be<00:04:21.730> adjusted<00:04:22.270> properly

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
and everything will be adjusted properly

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.540 
and everything will be adjusted properly
but<00:04:23.140> that's<00:04:23.560> probably<00:04:23.740> not<00:04:24.010> going<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.220> happen

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
but that's probably not going to happen

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.640 
but that's probably not going to happen
there's<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.240> other<00:04:25.330> headlight<00:04:25.780> I<00:04:26.020> still<00:04:26.530> got

also got a soldering tip that you can
put<00:04:48.130> in<00:04:48.250> there<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.610> was<00:04:49.420> using<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.870> soldering

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
put in there I was using the soldering

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.290 
put in there I was using the soldering
tip<00:04:50.440> for<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.710> while<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.370> wasn't<00:04:51.670> working<00:04:51.940> as

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
tip for a while and it wasn't working as

together it's got two 20 amp fuses a

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.429 
together it's got two 20 amp fuses a
relay<00:05:22.860> and<00:05:23.189> a<00:05:24.029> capacitor<00:05:24.719> right<00:05:24.960> here<00:05:25.199> and

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
relay and a capacitor right here and

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.999 
relay and a capacitor right here and
also<00:05:26.159> as<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:27.360> probably<00:05:28.259> can't<00:05:28.499> see<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.830> line

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
also as you probably can't see in line

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.649 
also as you probably can't see in line
anymore<00:05:29.340> oh<00:05:29.639> yeah<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:30.419> here

anymore oh yeah right here

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.899 
anymore oh yeah right here
was<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.349> the<00:05:31.439> passenger<00:05:31.889> here<00:05:32.099> too<00:05:32.370> so<00:05:32.669> this

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
was it the passenger here too so this

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.850 
was it the passenger here too so this
won't<00:05:33.090> allow<00:05:33.509> any<00:05:33.779> flickering<00:05:34.289> of<00:05:34.469> the<00:05:34.560> relay

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
won't allow any flickering of the relay

00:05:34.860 --> 00:06:35.660 
won't allow any flickering of the relay
or<00:05:35.159> flickering<00:05:35.550> on<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.759> lights<00:05:35.969> so<00:05:36.469> work<00:05:37.469> out
