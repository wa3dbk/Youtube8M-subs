00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
 k what are the 6 prince rocket already we saw monzant minds 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.069
 we saw monsoon prince what are the guides chock the masks 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.649
 thukral animation admired 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:14.829
 and well we have a very good idea of ​​what was lorenzo lasaosa of a technique 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.240
 different animation 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.720
 which is called sectur inc 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.669
 this as it indicates in its name mode help animate figures more than 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.640
 movements in the original animation that we were a 30 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 what we did was pampered object of a point make a point here flash 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.939
 assigned what happens between 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.339
 in seventh animation to create 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.280
 an object from another 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 islands assign the estates as being a quick example of this 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.980
 troicki what we take to the commented sector the guides that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.190
 they showed a little bit we're going to remove the most expensive 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.070
 here it hinders us either 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.200
 spa of can suction cup more than the parties can see in case those that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.160
 we are once 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.020
 and well we are going to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.070
 Do one thing check-ins as indicated by your name 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.610
 can only be done 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.660
 with basic figures, unconsolidated 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.750
 is how this floor we have here 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.180
 click on it a thousand floors to what when we have not consolidated an object 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.840
 comes out with dots 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.070
 inside they are as white as cris to the best 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.080
 any object that I create with an object tool 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.040
 they are unconsolidated because they are subject chelsea without any system has 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 little dots 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.530
 cheers 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.050
 so what are we going to do with you have this monsoon difference 30 animate objects 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.170
 not consolidated 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.520
 since they are remembered in the món sant benet bouquets animate are objects 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.630
 consolidated omo and clips 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 which are a symbol mentality symbols 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.439
 percent water 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.170
 it's going to be an experiment with the same floor that we already have here 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.660
 and so we're going to see several little things in one fell swoop 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.210
 let's encourage them 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.390
 totolapan and tsunami think a lot less three than before 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 is transformed into something 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.250
 as you know if it's going to be a very simple example before you get to that point 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.150
 we are going to add a you arrives above the floor 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.659
 and in that we take you to create a very simple object like this show 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.829
 those that 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.159
 I do not like them for an answer 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.989
 in fact I personally recommend that when you chew punset the ing 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.429
 make sure that there is no abortion 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.999
 the board we make some conflicts for animation and it is not as it is for 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.269
 fools bar 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.269
 let's put a solid color on it because we have balls 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.799
 acts as a mere example 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.499
 what started this figure 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.309
 automatically slasher we have seen it many times it assigns us a value see 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.569
 figures of 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.189
 first picture until the 30 that we arrived is the same as they say it but of what 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:42.529
 is 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.909
 up there nothing more fixed 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.079
 the most expensive are still there because that bothers us up 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.040
 so 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.209
 the interesting effects 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.280
 What I'm going to do is animate the blankets baloa site that for him the printing press 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.659
 love added figure in 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.659
 with the g6 and in that cyfra imbuía erase this figure 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.149
 if decision assumes white there is nothing left and it only reaches 29 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.999
 and in that white place I'm going to select now my 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.999
 treatment of polygons 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.849
 and I'm going to drop a polygon of another color without maslow edges this report 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.679
 and I'm going to put a single 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:23.659
 falcon text 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.930
 more orange oranges for those made by modern man to see what happens 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.759
 and we have taken out this city 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.019
 it is safe because the same place or another place is going to move when 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:35.419
 the 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.739
 let's put into action 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.739
 but also those that modify comics are black 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.269
 We look for we were born dead then start to modify a bit 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.159
 I did not like how it was and that in these centers is more or less not 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.610
 the conflict talks in carahue to modify them 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.889
 readers I have here 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.389
 that exists here perches of the experts will remember how are these points 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.159
 teams do not have how science are 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.159
 We will move forward in the management posts 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.409
 clear is that here 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.669
 we also want and we go for more let's complement we are what assets 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.769
 yonhap 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.019
 auseron 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.099
 for the subject figure is communes 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.270
 basic class of drawing his wife clear optimist 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.520
 Come on man efe 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 the text we are not going a myth 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.409
 he does not win 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.409
 wonderful copy of lavat and sener zeta 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.279
 perhaps as objects are the usual political class before hit this 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.550
 last I did with him down 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.949
 is my final figure but then we will have a square Cáceres side 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.860
 in torment I have this figure here 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.860
 Come on, common duckling gold, valuation 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.789
 will do if they remember how they are what we click 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.349
 at any point of view I think a right ok we select the last ones 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.349
 two 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.190
 we say it is positive 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.580
 in this case 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.050
 we were fritz edith stein 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.659
 and what happens 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.099
 automatically my timeline was transformed into green 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.279
 gymnastic in green means means that it is a 6 30 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.680
 purple means that they are mosson fifth but from the beginning 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 I give him buried to pass this 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.159
 although it is a very simple transformation 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.809
 blocks of that change of square adn bati torito 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:31.660
 of coffee 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.969
 to white 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.110
 that's what the six do that he installed as verses even the place 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.789
 We did not like it when they're here 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.569
 and I want it to start 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:43.969
 because here 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.689
 that we can rough portman that animation from left to right of e 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.719
 diagonal no 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.849
 to others we are very sorry the case with the rest but they go to more is an example 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.849
 compression ratio animation of 6 30 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.580
 if the che was the fastest 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.779
 I'm going to click on the timeline in the first box 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.569
 which is table 1 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.469
 and in the lower part or a part that says 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.229
 that means that there is so much talk 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.460
 flow 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.200
 melgen the movement of the selection cotes acceleration in a few words 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.279
 I have here in the first box x says the same steel 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:22.599
 that what we see here 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:23.699
 and we see what 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.710
 in the box presents 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.949
 with labaque sign says and is to be 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.129
 or believe what I want is 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.889
 that accelerates 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.559
 everything can be equipped the very drastic ponce the more or less 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.279
 propose three X's 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.949
 - One hundred that is like 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.949
 from -100 speed I'm going to 0 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:45.800
 that this last 3rd 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.710
 I prefer to call it than another then what follows from the effects of 20- 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.270
 hundred to 0 like that in 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.270
 in what makes the transition everything seems to accelerate 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.629
 I hope he killed the field I speak to you not 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.629
 from in 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.030
 and I say it because they have prevented it 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.159
 in a way as inverse 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.159
 this is created two degrees that's what a 6 is 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.939
 and the example that we are going to address this because 

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:16.979
 good many cases 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.210
 I'm going to show you a way to complement your animation 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:21.770
 we are going to see each other 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.980
 in the next block
