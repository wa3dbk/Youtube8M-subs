difference between all of that there's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
difference between all of that there's
quite<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> bit<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> difference<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.090> bikini

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
quite a bit of difference is bikini

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
quite a bit of difference is bikini
which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> more<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> bikini<00:01:19.500> body<00:01:19.920> look

all<00:01:58.940> right<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.390> we're<00:01:59.780> just<00:01:59.930> gonna<00:02:00.020> try

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
all right I think we're just gonna try

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.690 
all right I think we're just gonna try
and<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.470> your<00:02:00.590> heart<00:02:00.799> rate<00:02:00.950> up<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.130> bit<00:02:01.280> here<00:02:01.430> I

and get your heart rate up a bit here I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.950 
and get your heart rate up a bit here I
think<00:02:02.000> we<00:02:02.060> need<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.240> get<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> little<00:02:02.659> bit<00:02:02.750> leaner

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
think we need to get a little bit leaner

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.480 
think we need to get a little bit leaner
so<00:02:03.619> just<00:02:03.799> gonna<00:02:03.890> throw<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.310> weight<00:02:04.460> over
