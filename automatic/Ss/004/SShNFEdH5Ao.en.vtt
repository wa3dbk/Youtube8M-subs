into the specific review of this again
finding<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> right<00:00:12.300> stand<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.110> your<00:00:13.170> iPad

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
finding the right stand for your iPad

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.289 
finding the right stand for your iPad
probably<00:00:14.040> depends<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.639> use<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.030> but

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
probably depends on how you use it but

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.349 
probably depends on how you use it but
i'm<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.509> firm<00:00:15.540> believer<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:17.279> needs<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.270> be

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
i'm a firm believer and that needs to be

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.140 
i'm a firm believer and that needs to be
something<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> stand<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.160> get

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
something at a stand that you can get

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.700 
something at a stand that you can get
close<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.020> rotate<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.480> ipad<00:00:25.230> with<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
close to and rotate the ipad with and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.019 
close to and rotate the ipad with and
you<00:00:25.769> need<00:00:25.949> pretty<00:00:26.250> much<00:00:26.400> evolved<00:00:26.880> for

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
you need pretty much evolved for

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
you need pretty much evolved for
rotating<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> wanted<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> able<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
rotating so you wanted to be able to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
rotating so you wanted to be able to
rotate<00:00:28.859> not<00:00:29.279> just<00:00:29.490> around<00:00:29.760> backwards<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
rotate not just around backwards and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
rotate not just around backwards and
forwards<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.740> into<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> second

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
forwards which get into here in a second

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.510 
forwards which get into here in a second

of the belkin chef pad with stylus I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
of the belkin chef pad with stylus I
wasn't<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.670> complimentary<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
wasn't very complimentary of this I

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.500 
wasn't very complimentary of this I
would<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.200> buy<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.890> all

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.670 

mercury<00:00:46.320> rotating<00:00:46.890> stand<00:00:47.780> itself<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> solid

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
mercury rotating stand itself is solid

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
mercury rotating stand itself is solid
enough<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> bottom<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.539> kind<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
enough and on the bottom it's kind of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
enough and on the bottom it's kind of
got<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:53.159> rubber<00:00:53.460> piece<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
got this little rubber piece here that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
got this little rubber piece here that
keeps<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.109> sliding<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> stays<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
keeps it from sliding the stays in

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
keeps it from sliding the stays in
position<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.519> well<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.449> one

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
position really well but it's got one

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
position really well but it's got one
really<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.829> big<00:00:59.010> problem<00:00:59.539> which<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.659> get

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
really really big problem which will get

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.509 
really really big problem which will get
to<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.469> second<00:01:01.920> another<00:01:02.369> good

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
thing about the stand is it's really

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.930 
thing about the stand is it's really
simple<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.440> your<00:01:04.589> ipad<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
there and then snap snap my

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.070 
there and then snap snap my
five-year-old<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> holds

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
five-year-old can do that and it holds

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.160 
five-year-old can do that and it holds
it<00:01:10.259> in<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.770> well<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.700> see

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
it in there really well you can see

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.700 
it in there really well you can see
rotates<00:01:13.170> pretty<00:01:13.500> smoothly<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> fatal

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
rotates pretty smoothly but the fatal

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
rotates pretty smoothly but the fatal
flaw<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> wanted<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> stand<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.569> never

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
flaw and wanted to stand you can never

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.120 
flaw and wanted to stand you can never
never<00:01:19.619> ever<00:01:19.740> buy<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.490> recommend<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:22.130> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
never ever buy or recommend is it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490 
never ever buy or recommend is it
doesn't<00:01:23.490> rotate<00:01:23.750> backwards<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.080> forwards

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
doesn't rotate backwards and forwards

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
doesn't rotate backwards and forwards
and<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.369> does<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.789> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:26.970> too<00:01:27.179> far

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and if it does get a little too far

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.960 
and if it does get a little too far
forward<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> huge<00:01:31.259> problem

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
forward that is a huge problem

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.039 
forward that is a huge problem
especially<00:01:32.970> fueling<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.539> five-year-old

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
especially fueling your five-year-old

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.350 
especially fueling your five-year-old
use<00:01:34.319> your<00:01:34.710> iPad<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.909> totally<00:01:36.240> see

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
use your iPad like I do can totally see

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.139 
use your iPad like I do can totally see
the<00:01:36.509> screen<00:01:36.750> cracking<00:01:37.729> due<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.819> a<00:01:38.909> mistake

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
the screen cracking due to a mistake

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.789 
the screen cracking due to a mistake
like<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.539> now<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> reason<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.709> they

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
like that now the reason I think they

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.680 
like that now the reason I think they
did<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.399> because<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:42.030> folds<00:01:42.240> over<00:01:42.450> like

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
did it is because it folds over like

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.630 
did it is because it folds over like
this<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.709> nice<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.190> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this and this is nice if you want to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.010 
this and this is nice if you want to
take<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.119> somewhere<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.539> can<00:01:45.690> just<00:01:45.810> easily

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
take it somewhere you can just easily

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.820 
take it somewhere you can just easily
fold<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.069> into<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.369> briefcase<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.240> backpack

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.449 
something like that I'm just carrying
around<00:01:51.410> without<00:01:52.410> taking<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.160> out<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
around without taking it out of the

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.279 
around without taking it out of the
stand<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.069> risk<00:01:56.069> of<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.849> falling<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.780> its

stand but the risk of it falling on its

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.729 
stand but the risk of it falling on its
face<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> speak<00:01:59.489> or<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.179> screen<00:02:00.629> is<00:02:00.899> just

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
face so to speak or on a screen is just

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.639 
face so to speak or on a screen is just
way<00:02:02.069> too<00:02:02.129> high<00:02:02.459> so<00:02:02.849> I<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.319> and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
way too high so I do not like that and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.350 
way too high so I do not like that and
then<00:02:05.069> the<00:02:05.190> other<00:02:05.280> another<00:02:05.789> little<00:02:06.090> problem

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
then the other another little problem

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.800 
then the other another little problem
about<00:02:06.720> it<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.019> it's<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.319> problem<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.879> my<00:02:08.879> wife

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810

thinks<00:02:10.019> it's<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.530> hard<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:11.009> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
thinks it's a little hard to get to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
stand that might be a consideration as

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.900 
stand that might be a consideration as
well<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> pretty<00:02:20.190> much<00:02:20.310> has<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.610> I'm

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.520 
you're looking for an ipad stand even if
it<00:02:24.180> costs<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.690> money<00:02:24.930> i<00:02:25.019> highly

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it costs a little more money i highly

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.960 
it costs a little more money i highly
recommend<00:02:26.099> getting<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.580> has<00:02:26.700> ball

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
recommend getting one that has ball

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.399 
recommend getting one that has ball
rotation<00:02:27.420> because<00:02:27.810> that's<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.290> most

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
rotation because that's the most

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.259 
rotation because that's the most
important<00:02:28.830> feature<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.129> any<00:02:29.370> stand<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
important feature of any stand and the

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.540 
important feature of any stand and the
second<00:02:30.599> most<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.349> solid<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.310> we'll

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
second most is that it's solid so we'll

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.909 
second most is that it's solid so we'll
see
