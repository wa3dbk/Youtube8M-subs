00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 whenever you do in the ink plane 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.080
 because the first step that is very 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
 important is to verify that the plan is 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 perfect and for the plan to be 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.250
 perfect is that you have the curves 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.050
 that match the plan 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.330
 if you sometimes do it directly with the 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.750
 mobile 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.760
 then going to plot the annuity curve or 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.470
 1 on the curve 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.120
 because the mold was already 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.370
 worn out and then I can not 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.740
 blame the mold 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.200
 I start with my plane in pencil and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.480
 the first thing I do is go to ink 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.740
 each of the lines defining 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.740
 correctly the stroke 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.079
 i 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.920
 my curtain here there are no problems the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.920
 field distance 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 madness 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 punctual 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.570
 for example this waist line 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.000
 for that is that we have to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.000
 rectify and verify 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 let's try to be 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.320
 Cleaning 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.400
 so that we do not have problems 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.400
 with the ink 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.090
 is this what is complex simply 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.100
 let's say it's a first step 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.740
 obligatory for you because you 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.730
 they do not usually have molds well 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.710
 cut 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.690
 and then there we would be pulling 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.440
 manila nothing more the side that should 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.100
 be right 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.100
 and several curves 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.980
 we do everything that is straight and right now 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.830
 for example the armhole line does not 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.289
 we need 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.280
 what we need right now is to make 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.280
 the magicians 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.620
 important that the plane is in ink 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.900
 because if I'm wrong about the product 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.900
 drawing a coordinate or erase 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.530
 they were all same 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.300
 in pencil you do not make ink so 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.750
 that I can erase without affecting the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 other sizes 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.560
 now we go through the curves that are the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.180
 most important 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.230
 always always neck for example 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.740
 you have to improve it 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.750
 because it is like in the neck 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.560
 and here what I do and this is my 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.340
 first squad 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.340
 and I go 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.450
 always a neckline goes very very vertical no 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.450
 I know if they remember it from drapes 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.080
 also already and I would have a first 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.400
 problem when I'm going to trace the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.860
 next necklines I would not have 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.690
 neckline of the base never coincided 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.690
 with the new necklines 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's go once to draw the squad 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.310
 for the armhole 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.100
 that would be to move here on the side 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.930
 of laughter 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.719
 the side 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.719
 And so I can easily trace 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.990
 they have to this either 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.160
 he gave me here 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.160
 to match 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.200
 draft 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.090
 yes that's why I asked them for a pencil 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.150
 that they realized that by rectifying 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.590
 the traces especially the curves were going to 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.840
 They vary widely over here to straight 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.800
 several not only after these two bases is 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.420
 all 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.420
 I'm going to erase a pencil 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.540
 they will always save in this direction 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.110
 ensuring that the draft is not 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.110
 hurt 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.230
 with the drafts
