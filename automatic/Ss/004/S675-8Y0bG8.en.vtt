comparison so this time we're checking
out<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> m40a5<00:00:12.240> versus<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> GOL<00:00:13.259> magnum<00:00:13.290> the

new bolt-action sniper rifle from the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.359 
new bolt-action sniper rifle from the
second<00:00:15.570> assault<00:00:15.809> ELC<00:00:16.320> yeah<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> would<00:00:17.220> say

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
second assault ELC yeah I would say

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.820 
second assault ELC yeah I would say
let's<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.789> started<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> first<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.680> as

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
let's get it started so first of all as

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010 
let's get it started so first of all as
you<00:00:19.949> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.310> they're<00:00:20.580> both<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:21.510> pretty

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
you can see they're both really pretty

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.210 
you can see they're both really pretty
much<00:00:22.109> carried<00:00:22.500> towards<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> aggressive

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
much carried towards the aggressive

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.830 
much carried towards the aggressive
recon<00:00:23.369> crowd<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> pretty<00:00:24.510> much<00:00:24.630> high

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
recon crowd we have a pretty much high

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
recon crowd we have a pretty much high
rate<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> fire<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.470> both<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.519> GOL

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
rate of fire with both of them the GOL

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.220 
rate of fire with both of them the GOL
magnum<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.090> slightly<00:00:27.359> faster<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.990> every

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
magnum is slightly faster with every

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
magnum is slightly faster with every
chamber<00:00:28.410> time<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.890> 0.9<00:00:29.519> five<00:00:29.789> instead<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.150> one

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
chamber time of 0.9 five instead of one

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.470 
chamber time of 0.9 five instead of one
second<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> m40a5<00:00:31.710> has<00:00:32.130> also<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> goal

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
second which the m40a5 has also the goal

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.540 
second which the m40a5 has also the goal
Magnum<00:00:33.780> has<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.079> better<00:00:34.469> damage<00:00:34.950> model<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
Magnum has a better damage model so the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
Magnum has a better damage model so the
damage<00:00:35.820> drop-off<00:00:36.059> will<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.450> completed<00:00:36.870> after

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
damage drop-off will be completed after

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
damage drop-off will be completed after
150<00:00:37.770> meters<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> m40a5<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.780> damage<00:00:40.020> will

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
150 meters for the m40a5 the damage will

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.750 
150 meters for the m40a5 the damage will
be<00:00:40.230> completed<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.950> damage<00:00:41.219> trouble<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:41.730> be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
be completed or damage trouble will be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.450 
be completed or damage trouble will be
completed<00:00:42.300> after<00:00:42.450> 100<00:00:43.170> meters<00:00:43.469> another

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
completed after 100 meters another

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
completed after 100 meters another
really<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.210> plus<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> gold<00:00:46.350> Magnum

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
really good plus for the gold Magnum

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.430 
really good plus for the gold Magnum
would<00:00:46.950> definitely<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.579> 100<00:00:48.570> meters<00:00:49.140> per

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
would definitely be the 100 meters per

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400 
would definitely be the 100 meters per
square<00:00:49.770> higher<00:00:50.550> bullet<00:00:50.879> velocity<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.510> 580

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
square higher bullet velocity of 580

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.700 
square higher bullet velocity of 580
meters<00:00:52.680> per<00:00:52.829> second<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.610> m4<00:00:53.850> a5<00:00:54.180> only<00:00:54.750> has<00:00:54.899> 480

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
meters per second the m4 a5 only has 480

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.099 
meters per second the m4 a5 only has 480
meters<00:00:55.890> per<00:00:56.160> second<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
meters per second but they do have the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.580 
meters per second but they do have the
same<00:00:58.320> bullet<00:00:58.649> drop<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.870> 9.81<00:01:00.870> meters<00:01:01.440> per

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
same bullet drop with an 9.81 meters per

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
same bullet drop with an 9.81 meters per
second<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.640> besides<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.719> say<00:01:04.290> though

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
second so besides that we can say though

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.090 
second so besides that we can say though
that<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.040> m40a5<00:01:05.549> has<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.360> better<00:01:06.840> reload<00:01:07.500> short

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that the m40a5 has a better reload short

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.660 
that the m40a5 has a better reload short
and<00:01:08.280> long<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:09.439> 2.7<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.619> 4<00:01:10.979> seconds<00:01:11.369> instead

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and long with 2.7 and 4 seconds instead

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.840 
and long with 2.7 and 4 seconds instead
of<00:01:11.729> 3.3<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.689> 4.1<00:01:13.650> which<00:01:13.860> makes<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> better<00:01:14.760> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of 3.3 and 4.1 which makes it better for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.179 
of 3.3 and 4.1 which makes it better for
reloading<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> hip<00:01:16.439> spread<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
reloading for the hip spread and the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
reloading for the hip spread and the
recoil<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.729> both<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.240> pretty<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> same

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
recoil we both have pretty much the same

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.859 
recoil we both have pretty much the same
thing<00:01:19.409> again<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> only<00:01:20.520> real<00:01:20.880> beneficial

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
thing again so the only real beneficial

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
thing again so the only real beneficial
side<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> m14<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:22.920> again<00:01:23.189> would<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
side of the m14 now again would be that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
side of the m14 now again would be that
we<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.299> health<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> 10<00:01:25.380> plus<00:01:25.560> 1<00:01:25.799> rounds<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
we would health and 10 plus 1 rounds in

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
we would health and 10 plus 1 rounds in
the<00:01:26.250> magazine<00:01:26.430> instead<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> 5<00:01:27.210> plus<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the magazine instead of 5 plus one of

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.620 
the magazine instead of 5 plus one of
the<00:01:28.170> gone<00:01:28.350> Magnum<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the gone Magnum so as you can see and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
the gone Magnum so as you can see and
those<00:01:31.140> two<00:01:31.439> rifles<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.890> pretty<00:01:32.250> well

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
those two rifles are pretty well

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
those two rifles are pretty well
balanced<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
balanced and if you are going for the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
balanced and if you are going for the
aggressive<00:01:34.350> recon<00:01:34.650> play<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.400> use

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
aggressive recon play so you can use

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
aggressive recon play so you can use
either<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.060> them<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.439> fit

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
either of them because they really fit

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
either of them because they really fit
the<00:01:37.680> play<00:01:37.920> style<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> high<00:01:39.030> rate<00:01:39.210> of

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the play style you have a high rate of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.140 
the play style you have a high rate of
fire<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:40.079> doing<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.590> damage<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.150> most

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
fire you're doing good damage and most

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
fire you're doing good damage and most
of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> time<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.750> don't<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.350> reload<00:01:44.159> for

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
of the time you don't have to reload for

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.800 
of the time you don't have to reload for
a<00:01:44.430> real<00:01:44.640> long<00:01:44.759> time<00:01:44.820> because<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> reads<00:01:45.689> are

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
a real long time because the reads are

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.260 
a real long time because the reads are
also<00:01:45.960> pretty<00:01:46.320> short<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> only<00:01:47.759> real

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
also pretty short now the only real

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480 
also pretty short now the only real
major<00:01:48.509> drawback<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.380> basically<00:01:50.100> really

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
major drawback which basically really

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.030 
major drawback which basically really
holds<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:51.360> magnum<00:01:51.780> bag<00:01:51.930> otherwise<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.890> be

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
holds your magnum bag otherwise would be

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.770 
holds your magnum bag otherwise would be
completely<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.450> able<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
completely it would be able to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.170 
completely it would be able to
completely<00:01:55.079> overrun<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> m40a5<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> low

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
completely overrun the m40a5 is the low

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
completely overrun the m40a5 is the low
magazine<00:01:57.719> count<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> low<00:01:58.740> ammo<00:01:59.340> count

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
magazine count or the low ammo count

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.450 
magazine count or the low ammo count
because<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.780> 6<00:02:01.380> rounds<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.280> magazine

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because with 6 rounds in the magazine

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.749 
because with 6 rounds in the magazine
you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.540> kill<00:02:04.170> 6<00:02:04.619> people<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.130> most<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.610> you're

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you can kill 6 people at most if you're

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.980 
you can kill 6 people at most if you're
hitting<00:02:05.939> headshot<00:02:06.329> after<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> child<00:02:06.869> after

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
hitting headshot after a child after

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.180 
hitting headshot after a child after
headshot<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.160> be

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
headshot and I know this can be

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.580 
headshot and I know this can be
difficult<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.479> people<00:02:09.959> are<00:02:10.200> moving

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
difficult and I know people are moving

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.470 
difficult and I know people are moving
in<00:02:10.739> weird<00:02:10.979> direction<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.239> really

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
in weird direction so this is really

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.520 
in weird direction so this is really
hard<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> do

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
hard to do

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
hard to do
the<00:02:13.770> infrared<00:02:14.010> five<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.640> bit<00:02:14.730> more

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the infrared five is a little bit more

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.430 
the infrared five is a little bit more
forgiving<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.390> also<00:02:15.720> has<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.110> greater

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
forgiving and also has a greater

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.250 
forgiving and also has a greater
potential<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.400> would<00:02:18.210> say<00:02:18.420> I'm<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.050> GOL

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
potential so I would say I'm the GOL

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.780 
potential so I would say I'm the GOL
magnum<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.830> easier<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.220> use<00:02:20.520> for<00:02:20.730> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
magnum is easier to use for the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.180 
magnum is easier to use for the
aggressive<00:02:20.970> recon<00:02:21.240> playstyle<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.680> m40a5

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
aggressive recon playstyle but the m40a5

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.040 
aggressive recon playstyle but the m40a5
is<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> one<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.390> want<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.660> use<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:24.960> you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
is the one that you want to use if you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.070 
is the one that you want to use if you
really<00:02:25.350> want<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:26.360> hone<00:02:27.360> your<00:02:27.390> skills<00:02:27.870> if

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
really want to like hone your skills if

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.260 
really want to like hone your skills if
you<00:02:28.170> want<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.410> get<00:02:28.710> better<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> better<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.580> in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you want to get better and better and in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.000 
you want to get better and better and in
the<00:02:30.420> long<00:02:30.570> run<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.930> m-40<00:02:31.380> will<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.709> slightly

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the long run the m-40 will be slightly

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
the long run the m-40 will be slightly
better<00:02:32.250> probably<00:02:32.760> because<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.380> low<00:02:34.830> ammo

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
better probably because the low ammo

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
better probably because the low ammo
count<00:02:35.340> with<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.640> magnet<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
count with your magnet really can be a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
count with your magnet really can be a
hindering<00:02:37.260> factor<00:02:37.560> although<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.310> rate<00:02:38.430> of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
hindering factor although the rate of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.340 
hindering factor although the rate of
fire<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.760> higher<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.720> yeah<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.020> please<00:02:40.170> let

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
fire is higher but yeah and please let

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.390 
fire is higher but yeah and please let
me<00:02:40.380> know<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.740> would<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.250> next

me know what you would like to see next
maybe<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> weapon<00:02:42.090> comparison<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.900> another

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
maybe not a weapon comparison or another

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.840 
maybe not a weapon comparison or another
episode<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.770> something<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.400> don't<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.640> but

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
episode of something I don't know but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.610 
episode of something I don't know but
yeah<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.750> think<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.110> pretty<00:02:46.200> much<00:02:46.320> all<00:02:46.470> for

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
yeah I think it's pretty much all for

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.930 
yeah I think it's pretty much all for
now<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.920> hope<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.160> enjoyed<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> video<00:02:47.580> like
