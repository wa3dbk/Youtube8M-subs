another reason why I do this journal

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
another reason why I do this journal
like<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.860> example<00:01:40.920> when<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.630> new<00:01:42.810> babies

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
like for example when the new babies

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.830 
like for example when the new babies
came<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.159> live<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.340> us<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.420> know<00:01:45.540> I've<00:01:45.659> got

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
came to live with us you know I've got

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.130 
came to live with us you know I've got
it<00:01:45.960> documented<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:47.540> when<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.689> picked<00:01:48.960> them

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it documented when when we picked them

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.319 
it documented when when we picked them
up<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> can<00:01:50.520> look<00:01:50.790> back<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
up you know so I can look back on in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.969 
up you know so I can look back on in
future<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.780> when<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.770> got

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
future and go when was it that we got

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.520 
future and go when was it that we got
the<00:01:53.130> girls<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.479> oh<00:01:54.780> yeah<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.380> got

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the girls and then we go oh yeah we got

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
the girls and then we go oh yeah we got
the<00:01:55.619> money<00:01:55.799> level<00:01:56.100> two<00:01:56.189> genuine<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.329> think

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the money level two genuine so I think

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
the money level two genuine so I think
that's<00:01:57.689> quite<00:01:57.840> important<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> record<00:01:58.619> life

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that's quite important to record life

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.630 
that's quite important to record life
events<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> stuff<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.399> then<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
events and stuff and then on the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
events and stuff and then on the
