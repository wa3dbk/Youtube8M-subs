00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
basically everything's housed in here

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.530 
basically everything's housed in here
the<00:01:10.260> first<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.430> tripod<00:01:11.760> mount<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the first one is the tripod mount you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
the first one is the tripod mount you
have<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.960> under<00:01:13.920> beneath<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.670> you're

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have that under beneath that you're

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
have that under beneath that you're
going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> 2<00:01:16.170> x<00:01:16.439> telephoto<00:01:17.220> lens

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

going to have the 2 x telephoto lens
right<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.960> remove<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
right here so you can just remove that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.399 
right here so you can just remove that
the<00:01:20.460> middle<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.210> believe<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.170> be

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the middle one I believe is going to be

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.450 
the middle one I believe is going to be
the<00:01:22.799> super<00:01:23.610> wide<00:01:23.880> angle<00:01:24.170> lens<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.500> finally

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the super wide angle lens and finally

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
the super wide angle lens and finally
you<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> macro<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you have just the macro one for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.030 
you have just the macro one for
close-ups<00:01:30.049> honestly<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.590> simple

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
close-ups honestly it's very simple

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.850 
close-ups honestly it's very simple
attaching<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> lenses<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.170> into<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
attaching the lenses to the into the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.910 
attaching the lenses to the into the
camera<00:01:35.400> case<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.450> basically<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:37.470> line<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
camera case here so basically we line it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.670 
camera case here so basically we line it
up<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> from<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.360> twist<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
up and from here we just twist in the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.219 
up and from here we just twist in the
clockwise<00:01:41.009> motion<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.820> lock<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> place<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
clockwise motion to lock in place and it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.649 
clockwise motion to lock in place and it
firmly<00:01:43.590> stays<00:01:44.130> put<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.509> any

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the stock is camera application I have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
the stock is camera application I have
the<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.240> 2<00:01:54.479> x<00:01:54.720> telephoto<00:01:55.320> lens<00:01:55.770> attached<00:01:56.189> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the the 2 x telephoto lens attached to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.300 
the the 2 x telephoto lens attached to
it<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.090> how<00:01:57.119> close<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.810> am<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it you can see how close I am to the to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
it you can see how close I am to the to
the<00:01:59.490> subject<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.229> off

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the subject right here if I take it off

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
the subject right here if I take it off
you'll<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> difference<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.850> how

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
you'll just see the difference at how

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.609 
you'll just see the difference at how
far<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:06.079> that's<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.170> I'm<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> show

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
far it is that's what I'm going to show

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.859 
far it is that's what I'm going to show
you<00:02:07.680> here<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.220> super<00:02:08.700> wide<00:02:08.940> angle<00:02:09.569> lens

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you here is the super wide angle lens

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.600 
you here is the super wide angle lens
now<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.530> one's<00:02:10.709> pretty<00:02:10.950> neat<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.310> because

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
now this one's pretty neat just because

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.440 
now this one's pretty neat just because
you're<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> see<00:02:12.300> more<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you're going to be able to see more the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.120 
you're going to be able to see more the
so<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.020> what<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.200> looks<00:02:14.410> like<00:02:14.500> without

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
so this is what it looks like without

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.550 
so this is what it looks like without
the<00:02:15.610> lens<00:02:16.060> attachment<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.230> could<00:02:17.500> see

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the lens attachment on so you could see

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.190 
the lens attachment on so you could see
how<00:02:18.280> far<00:02:18.580> how<00:02:18.880> stretch<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.360> goes<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.020> when<00:02:20.170> I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
how far how stretch that goes but when I

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.190 
how far how stretch that goes but when I
attach<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.040> here<00:02:21.720> you'll<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> big

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
attach this one here you'll see a big

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.140 
attach this one here you'll see a big
difference<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:23.890> there's<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> lot<00:02:24.700> more<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
difference now there's a lot more the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.180 
difference now there's a lot more the
scenery<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.870> could<00:02:26.110> view<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.070> have

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
scenery that we could view and you have

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.700 
scenery that we could view and you have
that<00:02:27.310> really<00:02:27.700> neat<00:02:28.240> panoramic<00:02:29.110> look<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
that really neat panoramic look to it

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.740 
that really neat panoramic look to it
the<00:02:30.640> last<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:30.850> I'm<00:02:31.000> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.180> show<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.420> here

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the last one I'm going to show you here

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
the last one I'm going to show you here
is<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.320> macro<00:02:32.890> lens<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> thinnest

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
is just the macro lens it's the thinnest

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820 
is just the macro lens it's the thinnest
out<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.510> bunch<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.320> some<00:02:35.500> really

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
out of the bunch and you get some really

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.460 
out of the bunch and you get some really
nice<00:02:36.190> close-up<00:02:36.760> shots<00:02:37.060> with<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.410> is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
nice close-up shots with it so this is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.500 
nice close-up shots with it so this is
will<00:02:39.010> try<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.310> best<00:02:39.550> demo<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.420> on

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
will try and best demo this here on

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.840 
will try and best demo this here on
video<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.770> have<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> camera<00:02:42.820> here

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
video for you so I have a camera here

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.220 
video for you so I have a camera here
I'm<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.360> try<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.690> see<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:43.960> get<00:02:44.020> as

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
I'm going to try and see if I get as

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.010 
I'm going to try and see if I get as
close<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> without<00:02:44.950> losing<00:02:45.310> focus<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.870> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
close to without losing focus so this is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.280 
close to without losing focus so this is
what<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.320> looks<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:48.360> when<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.390> try<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.780> go<00:02:50.080> as

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
what it looks like when I try to go as

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.980 
what it looks like when I try to go as
close<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.390> camera<00:02:52.810> without

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
close I can to the to the camera without

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.440 
close I can to the to the camera without
losing<00:02:53.290> focus<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:54.400> as<00:02:54.550> close<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.180> get

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
losing focus so that's as close I get

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.660 
losing focus so that's as close I get
now<00:02:55.960> when<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.140> attach<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.920> lens<00:02:57.250> here<00:02:57.520> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
now when I attach the lens here the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.820 
now when I attach the lens here the
macro<00:02:58.060> lens<00:02:58.330> you'll<00:02:58.600> see<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.050> big<00:02:59.590> difference

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
macro lens you'll see a big difference

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.550 
macro lens you'll see a big difference
in<00:03:00.250> how<00:03:00.460> close<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:01.030> get<00:03:01.300> into<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> shot<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.350> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
in how close we get into the shot so I

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.680 
in how close we get into the shot so I
just<00:03:03.220> move<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.580> closer<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.120> see<00:03:07.450> how

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
just move this closer you could see how

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.900 
just move this closer you could see how
much<00:03:07.870> more<00:03:08.170> detail<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.520> check<00:03:09.700> these

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
much more detail you could check these

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.580 
much more detail you could check these
samples<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.630> on<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.840> site<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.410> get<00:03:11.530> a

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
samples we have on the site to get a

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.620 
samples we have on the site to get a
better<00:03:11.860> view<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.400> how<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.910> looks<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.420> it's

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
better view of how it looks but it's

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.230 
better view of how it looks but it's
pretty<00:03:14.050> pretty<00:03:14.770> impressive<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.580> how<00:03:15.970> close

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
pretty pretty impressive and how close

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.000 
pretty pretty impressive and how close
you<00:03:16.510> get<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.900> something<00:03:17.200> without<00:03:17.470> losing

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
you get to something without losing

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.800 
you get to something without losing
focus

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
