the<00:01:56.920> Bears<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.369> extinction<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.759> much<00:02:10.060> more

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
the Bears of extinction it's much more

in<00:02:12.430> their<00:02:12.880> frustration<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:22.510> which<00:02:23.170> may<00:02:23.350> be

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
in their frustration this which may be

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.460 
in their frustration this which may be
used<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:24.010> cook<00:02:24.160> porridge<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.989> chance<00:02:26.290> of

used to cook porridge in the chance of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.530 
used to cook porridge in the chance of
ever<00:02:26.650> bear<00:02:26.950> actually<00:02:27.700> being<00:02:27.940> able<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> cook

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
ever bear actually being able to cook

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.410 
ever bear actually being able to cook
porridge<00:02:28.870> no<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:30.099> can't<00:02:30.430> see<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:36.209> they<00:02:37.209> would

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
porridge no I can't see that they would

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.630 
porridge no I can't see that they would
then<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.750> able<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> milk<00:02:38.769> carton<00:02:39.220> open

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
then be able to get the milk carton open

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.140 
then be able to get the milk carton open
I<00:02:39.880> think<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:41.170> bear<00:02:41.319> would<00:02:41.440> lose<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.489> throw

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
I think the bear would lose it and throw

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.809 
I think the bear would lose it and throw
uncooked<00:02:43.810> porridge<00:02:44.260> lakes<00:02:44.560> everywhere

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.179 

that's<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.569> best<00:02:51.810> fight<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:53.159> a

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
that's the best fight of it what a

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.309 
that's the best fight of it what a
Goldilocks<00:02:53.640> could<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> young<00:02:54.659> girl<00:02:55.109> have

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
Goldilocks could a young girl have

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.410 
Goldilocks could a young girl have
gained<00:02:55.530> access<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:56.219> a<00:02:56.250> bears<00:02:56.519> house<00:02:56.790> eating
