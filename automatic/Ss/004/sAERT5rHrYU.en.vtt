00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
these here's the other angle so this is
what<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> doing<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
what I was going to be doing here in the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
what I was going to be doing here in the
back<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.819> take<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> step<00:02:09.239> back<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
back up when we take a step back so you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.380 
back up when we take a step back so you
can<00:02:10.190> soak<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.400> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
can soak it in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.490 
can soak it in
whether<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.430> hmm<00:02:14.430> anyway<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.930> ended<00:02:16.380> up

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
whether that hmm anyway so I ended up

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.780 
whether that hmm anyway so I ended up
getting<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.800> rack<00:02:17.190> actually<00:02:17.490> I've<00:02:17.580> had<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
getting this rack actually I've had this

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
getting this rack actually I've had this
rack<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.240> like<00:02:18.330> years<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.350> only<00:02:19.440> had<00:02:19.650> two

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
rack for like years but it only had two

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.470 
rack for like years but it only had two
shells<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.430> had<00:02:20.550> two<00:02:20.700> separate<00:02:21.060> ones<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
shells and I had two separate ones and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.710 
shells and I had two separate ones and
then<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:22.440> made<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:23.180> full<00:02:24.180> rack<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
then I just made a full rack and that I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.059 
then I just made a full rack and that I
have<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.959> other<00:02:25.110> bars<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.560> additional

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
have the other bars for the additional

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.250 
have the other bars for the additional
one<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:26.490> gonna<00:02:26.580> have<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> second<00:02:27.150> rack<00:02:28.080> like

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
one so I'm gonna have a second rack like

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.830 
one so I'm gonna have a second rack like
this<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.709> just<00:02:29.190> ordered<00:02:29.430> two<00:02:29.459> more<00:02:30.180> shelves<00:02:30.600> so

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
this I just ordered two more shelves so

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600 
this I just ordered two more shelves so
figured<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.740> might<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:31.920> well<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.160> them<00:02:32.280> sensor

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
figured I might as well use them sensor

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.120 
figured I might as well use them sensor
in<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.209> room<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:34.500> box<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.860> kept<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
in this this room the box is kept on

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.760 
in this this room the box is kept on
getting<00:02:35.250> destroyed<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.740> reason

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
getting destroyed so that is the reason

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.290 
getting destroyed so that is the reason
why<00:02:38.100> did<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.370> let's<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.820> look<00:02:39.000> at<00:02:39.060> here

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
why did that let's take a look at here

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.270 
why did that let's take a look at here
pretty<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> pretty<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.709> point<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> little

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
pretty a pretty on point it's a little

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180 
pretty a pretty on point it's a little
bit<00:02:41.370> smaller<00:02:41.610> pattern<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.890> shoes

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
bit smaller pattern then the the shoes

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.650 
bit smaller pattern then the the shoes
it<00:02:44.610> looks<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:44.880> well<00:02:45.120> maybe<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.480> about

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
it looks like well maybe it's about

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.560 
it looks like well maybe it's about
right<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.020> mean<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.010> made<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:47.820> it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
right I mean it's made for it so it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.270 
right I mean it's made for it so it
should<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.200> should<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.470> legit<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.100> can

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
should it should be legit and you can

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
should it should be legit and you can
there<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.480> tell<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.750> metallic

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
there you can kind of tell it's metallic

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
there you can kind of tell it's metallic
it's<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.890> metallic<00:02:53.220> top<00:02:53.489> first<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.600> like

we<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.660> here<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.110> let's<00:03:43.709> take<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
we have going on here so let's take a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.039 
we have going on here so let's take a
look<00:03:44.160> at<00:03:44.220> these<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.549> again<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.570> carbon<00:03:45.900> fiber

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
look at these so again the carbon fiber

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.500 
look at these so again the carbon fiber
plate<00:03:46.350> is<00:03:46.470> kind<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.769> crazy<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.760> like<00:03:47.910> black

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
plate is kind of crazy it's like black

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.150 
plate is kind of crazy it's like black
and<00:03:49.250> red<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:51.030> usually<00:03:51.570> like<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:53.010> can

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
and red and it's usually like you can

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.979 
and red and it's usually like you can
tell<00:03:53.310> from<00:03:53.430> any<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.700> these<00:03:53.820> ones<00:03:54.120> they're<00:03:54.780> just

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
tell from any of these ones they're just

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.430 
tell from any of these ones they're just
straight-up<00:03:55.260> black<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:56.780> most<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.989> all<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
straight-up black on most of all of the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.710 
straight-up black on most of all of the
other<00:03:58.590> ones<00:03:58.769> so<00:03:58.970> as<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> first<00:04:00.269> time<00:04:00.390> effects

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
other ones so as the first time effects

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.970 
other ones so as the first time effects
actually<00:04:01.230> out<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.410> all<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.530> these<00:04:01.680> ones<00:04:01.890> I've

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
actually out of all of these ones I've

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.670 
actually out of all of these ones I've
seen<00:04:02.010> with<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.880> colored<00:04:03.180> fiber<00:04:03.680> colored

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
seen with the colored fiber colored

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.289 
seen with the colored fiber colored
carbon<00:04:05.040> fiber<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.459> bottom<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.150> goes

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
carbon fiber on the bottom and it goes

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.090 
carbon fiber on the bottom and it goes
all<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.510> way<00:04:06.660> through<00:04:06.860> kind<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:07.980> cool
