00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
water but what the the main focus here

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.680 
water but what the the main focus here
is<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.079> alkalizing<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> water<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
is it's alkalizing the water and what we

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500 
is it's alkalizing the water and what we
want<00:00:42.870> alkaline<00:00:43.530> water<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
want alkaline water is because it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.690 
want alkaline water is because it
actually<00:00:46.200> helps<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> bring<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> alkalinity

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
actually helps to bring the alkalinity

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240 
actually helps to bring the alkalinity
up<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.300> our<00:00:48.420> body<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> were<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> drink<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
up in our body so if you were to drink a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.840 
up in our body so if you were to drink a
pop<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:52.190> 22.5<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> pH

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
pop that would be about 22.5 on a pH

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.750 
pop that would be about 22.5 on a pH
scale<00:00:54.289> normal<00:00:55.289> water<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.770> seven<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
scale normal water is seven and when we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.760 
scale normal water is seven and when we
put<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> filter<00:00:58.320> through

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
put it in here and have a filter through

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
put it in here and have a filter through
we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> up<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.090> about<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.420> eight

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we can take it up to about an eight

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
we can take it up to about an eight
point<00:01:00.870> five<00:01:01.230> maybe<00:01:01.680> even<00:01:01.859> nine<00:01:02.219> depending<00:01:02.730> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
point five maybe even nine depending on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
point five maybe even nine depending on
the<00:01:02.969> water<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.080> drinking<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the water and what we're drinking that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
the water and what we're drinking that
that's<00:01:04.979> bringing<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.610> alkalinity<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.810> our

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that's bringing the alkalinity of our

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.370 
that's bringing the alkalinity of our
body<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.560> balancing<00:01:08.159> our<00:01:08.310> pH<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.720> can

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
body up balancing our pH so that can

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
body up balancing our pH so that can
have<00:01:10.560> major<00:01:11.010> major<00:01:13.670> benefits<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.630> our

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
have major major benefits to our to our

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
have major major benefits to our to our
body<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.369> alkaline

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
body when we get that to an alkaline

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.480 
body when we get that to an alkaline
environment<00:01:18.110> because<00:01:19.110> no<00:01:19.650> disease<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.310> live
