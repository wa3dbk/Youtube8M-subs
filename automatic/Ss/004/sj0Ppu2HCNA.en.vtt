they<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.519> get<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.800> exact<00:02:53.100> same

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
they can get in and so the exact same

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.030 
they can get in and so the exact same
thing<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.940> hamachi<00:02:54.450> IP<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.200> going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.530> be<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
thing as hamachi IP is going to be the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.900 
thing as hamachi IP is going to be the
minecraft<00:02:56.700> server<00:02:56.790> IP<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.920> we're<00:02:59.220> gonna<00:02:59.310> start

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
minecraft server IP so we're gonna start

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.790 
minecraft server IP so we're gonna start
this<00:03:00.120> open<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.319> minecraft<00:03:01.739> server

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
this open to get the minecraft server

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:10.009 
this open to get the minecraft server
running<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:08.330> apparently<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.540> our<00:03:09.690> key

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
running and apparently it's our key

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:20.520 
running and apparently it's our key
let's<00:03:10.230> try<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.560> again

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.290 

well<00:03:21.100> then<00:03:21.340> we'll<00:03:21.520> check<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.380> open<00:03:23.380> minecraft

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
well then we'll check and open minecraft

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.750 
well then we'll check and open minecraft
and<00:03:25.300> you'll<00:03:25.660> have<00:03:25.840> your<00:03:25.990> chat<00:03:26.320> logs<00:03:26.760> running

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
and you'll have your chat logs running

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.800 
and you'll have your chat logs running
this<00:03:28.090> whole<00:03:28.330> time

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
this whole time

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.750 
this whole time
it<00:03:29.080> must<00:03:29.350> be<00:03:29.530> running<00:03:29.860> for<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.070> server<00:03:30.490> to<00:03:30.640> be

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
it must be running for the server to be

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.160 
it must be running for the server to be
going<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:32.850> because<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.300> isn't<00:03:34.480> open<00:03:34.960> then

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
going on because if it isn't open then

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.920 
going on because if it isn't open then
it<00:03:35.830> won't<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.070> running<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:36.910> that'll<00:03:37.780> be<00:03:37.900> a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
it won't be running and that'll be a

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.130 
it won't be running and that'll be a
problem

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
problem

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.540 
problem
so<00:03:41.140> once<00:03:41.350> you<00:03:41.530> get<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.830> open<00:03:41.980> you're<00:03:42.400> gonna

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
so once you get it open you're gonna

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.150 
so once you get it open you're gonna
multi<00:03:43.450> player<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.670> it'll<00:03:45.940> be<00:03:46.920> you'll<00:03:47.920> add<00:03:48.130> a

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
multi player and it'll be you'll add a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.680 
multi player and it'll be you'll add a
new<00:03:48.400> server<00:03:48.690> maybe<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.960> think<00:03:49.990> in<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:52.510> will

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
new server maybe but I think in it will

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.400 
new server maybe but I think in it will
be<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.700> server<00:03:54.970> address<00:03:55.660> will<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.959> exact

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
be the server address will be the exact

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.310 
be the server address will be the exact
same<00:03:56.500> thing<00:03:56.680> as<00:03:57.010> your<00:03:57.130> hamachi<00:03:57.370> login

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
same thing as your hamachi login

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.170 
same thing as your hamachi login
it'll<00:03:59.320> mine<00:03:59.620> will<00:03:59.920> be<00:03:59.950> exactly<00:04:00.730> what<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:00.970> is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
it'll mine will be exactly what this is

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.240 
it'll mine will be exactly what this is
