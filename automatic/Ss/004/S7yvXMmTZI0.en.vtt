this<00:01:24.210> exercise<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
this exercise this is something that I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
this exercise this is something that I
recommend<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> exercise<00:01:27.090> population<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
recommend for the exercise population to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
recommend for the exercise population to
do<00:01:28.080> two<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> three<00:01:28.470> sets<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:29.070> ten<00:01:29.420> on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
do two to three sets of ten on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
do two to three sets of ten on
alternating<00:01:30.900> days<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.920> also<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
alternating days but also for the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
alternating days but also for the
running<00:01:32.939> population<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> great<00:01:34.110> way<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
running population it's a great way to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
running population it's a great way to
get<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.340> exercise<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.850> before
