a box like this along with an old rusted
exacto<00:05:00.390> knife<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.140> picked<00:05:01.530> up<00:05:01.650> these<00:05:01.800> two

exacto knife so I picked up these two
and<00:05:02.510> they're<00:05:03.510> both<00:05:03.750> extremely<00:05:04.140> solid<00:05:04.800> writing

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460

instruments<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.180> like<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:06.960> one<00:05:07.169> because<00:05:08.070> of

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
instruments I like this one because of

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.210 
instruments I like this one because of
the<00:05:08.550> huge<00:05:09.000> knurled<00:05:09.360> metal<00:05:09.600> grip<00:05:10.220> slightly

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
the huge knurled metal grip slightly

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.850 
the huge knurled metal grip slightly
more<00:05:11.610> than<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:12.000> other<00:05:12.510> newer<00:05:13.080> Mars<00:05:13.350> technical

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
more than the other newer Mars technical

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.650 
more than the other newer Mars technical
and<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.730> think<00:05:14.940> this<00:05:15.030> would<00:05:15.150> probably<00:05:15.330> go<00:05:15.630> for

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
and I think this would probably go for

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.320 
and I think this would probably go for
about<00:05:16.080> maybe<00:05:16.620> seven<00:05:17.100> or<00:05:17.280> eight<00:05:17.370> dollars<00:05:17.850> if<00:05:18.120> it

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
about maybe seven or eight dollars if it

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.800
