00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
file to get rid of all the code that we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.679 
file to get rid of all the code that we
use<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.500> include<00:00:19.830> different<00:00:20.039> classes<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.539> make

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
use to include different classes to make

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.900 
use to include different classes to make
a<00:00:21.720> basic<00:00:22.050> facebook<00:00:22.590> application<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.820> this

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
a basic facebook application so in this

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.099 
a basic facebook application so in this
tutorial<00:00:23.970> I'm<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> make<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> basic

tutorial I'm going to make a basic

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
tutorial I'm going to make a basic
application<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.400> echo<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> ID

classes one by one we're using the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.709 
classes one by one we're using the
built-in<00:00:39.780> functions<00:00:40.290> require<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.070> PHP<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
built-in functions require of PHP so

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.520

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
code and mind and so let's get started

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.200 
code and mind and so let's get started
you<00:02:26.520> also<00:02:27.060> need<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.150> to
