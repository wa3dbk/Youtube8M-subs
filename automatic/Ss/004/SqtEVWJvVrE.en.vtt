00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.110

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.459
 and today we have a game of modern 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.190
 cooperative warfare 2 with my friend 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.160
 l'unitÃ  greeting the unit 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.500
 this is the third video in our 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:26.100
 playlist of videos ready to handle 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 baby this is a race is a race 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.449
 of motorcycles 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.860
 let's see that I get very nervous 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.860
 in this clash 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.580
 you will win me of course 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.989
 everything I do 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.930
 ah 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.120
 you know 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 good good that I tried 7 right now 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.730
 driving this with the pipe in his hand 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.730
 wow wow 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 I'm stuck 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 he traveled in the sky with the uci 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.470
 we attended since 1880 to be more 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.370
 let's make the papers 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.370
 what happened 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.190
 and I'm going to really mourn the super jump 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.190
 impossible 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.050
 but that's a lie, men and I 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.050
 have a chapter being lima lose 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:23.550
 Well, I killed the second race here 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.550
 you can choose difficulty as always 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.210
 ok this is in trail means that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.680
 you have to go through some doors for about 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:35.850
 gates to increase the time that is 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.850
 take the time we do not achieve it 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.709
 good 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.709
 between those little flags, not exactly 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.450
 but I do not know how it slows down 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 will train with be 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.640
 like other 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.550
 what I 'm worth, yes, I 'm going 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.550
 for all because I'm following you 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.710
 are 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.140
 I I 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:33.250
 also because 17 seconds 19 we go 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.250
 come on come on 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.129
 it's 20 seconds 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.930
 the great fall the great charity 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.930
 I did not lose two boats 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:08.180
 well it's clear that apart from being 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:11.359
 good spies and sniper and everything and 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.019
 we also drive a motorcycle we are the 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.019
 better if it were 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.150
 and tell me you do not know we should make a 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.990
 mission more because you were very fast 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.220
 it seems perfect 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.700

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.300

 this is the good bonus track is clip 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.480
 killing agreement can not kill networks 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.480
 it can only kill bad 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.130
 list 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.130
