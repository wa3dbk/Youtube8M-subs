windows<00:00:04.470> 8<00:00:04.770> developer<00:00:05.580> preview<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.810> virtual

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
windows 8 developer preview in a virtual

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.030 
windows 8 developer preview in a virtual
machine<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:08.220> your<00:00:08.820> Mac<00:00:09.179> using<00:00:09.630> parallels<00:00:10.410> now

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
machine on your Mac using parallels now

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.339 
machine on your Mac using parallels now
just<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:11.940> I'm<00:00:12.179> using<00:00:12.420> parallels<00:00:12.990> doesn't

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
just because I'm using parallels doesn't

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
just because I'm using parallels doesn't
mean<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.679> can't<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.700> work<00:00:15.120> with

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
mean you can't use it it will work with

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.359 
mean you can't use it it will work with
basically<00:00:15.780> any<00:00:16.139> software<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.920> allows<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
basically any software that allows you

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.849 
basically any software that allows you
to<00:00:17.580> set<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.240> virtual<00:00:18.480> machine<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
to set up a virtual machine and the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.340 
to set up a virtual machine and the
process<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> basically<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> same<00:00:21.750> however

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
process is basically the same however

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890 
process is basically the same however
unless<00:00:22.740> you're<00:00:22.980> using<00:00:23.400> parallels<00:00:24.330> chances

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
unless you're using parallels chances

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
unless you're using parallels chances
are<00:00:25.050> good<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> will<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.680> slightly<00:00:25.949> different

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
are good it will be slightly different

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.300 
are good it will be slightly different
but<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.539> only<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.529> things<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
but you only really need two things the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.790 
but you only really need two things the
software<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> set<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.840> your<00:00:30.960> virtual<00:00:31.410> machine

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
software to set up your virtual machine

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.639 
software to set up your virtual machine
and<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.880> copy<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.450> Windows<00:00:33.930> 8<00:00:34.140> Developer

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and your copy of Windows 8 Developer

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
and your copy of Windows 8 Developer
Preview<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> link<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.809> below

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
Preview so I will have a link down below

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160 
Preview so I will have a link down below
in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.290> more<00:00:37.500> info<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.670> website<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
in the more info to my website and it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
in the more info to my website and it
will<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> link<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.120> can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
will have a link to this where you can

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.410 
will have a link to this where you can
come<00:00:42.780> over<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.100> download<00:00:44.100> Windows<00:00:44.850> 8<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
come over and download Windows 8 now you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.500 
come over and download Windows 8 now you
can<00:00:45.690> download<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.440> 64<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.250> 32-bit<00:00:47.850> versions

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
can download at 64 or 32-bit versions

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.180 
can download at 64 or 32-bit versions
and<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> only<00:00:49.320> difference<00:00:49.590> between

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and really the only difference between

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
and really the only difference between
32<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.030> 64-bit<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> way<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.379> handles<00:00:52.620> your

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
32 and 64-bit is the way it handles your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.119 
32 and 64-bit is the way it handles your
memory<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.600> over<00:00:55.350> 2<00:00:55.590> gigabytes

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
memory so if you have over 2 gigabytes

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.090 
memory so if you have over 2 gigabytes
then<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.760> will<00:00:57.000> need<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> download<00:00:57.570> Windows<00:00:58.530> 8

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
then you will need to download Windows 8

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.569 
then you will need to download Windows 8
developer<00:01:00.030> preview<00:01:00.329> at<00:01:00.739> 64-bit<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.219> once<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
developer preview at 64-bit so once you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
developer preview at 64-bit so once you
have<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> downloaded<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.570> open<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.110> your

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
have it downloaded you can open up your

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
have it downloaded you can open up your
program<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.369> set<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> your<00:01:05.909> virtual<00:01:06.330> machine

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
program to set up your virtual machine

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.440 
program to set up your virtual machine
so<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.590> parallels<00:01:08.159> desktop<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.240> right

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
so I have parallels desktop open right

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.780 
so I have parallels desktop open right
here<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:10.860> file<00:01:11.220> new

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
here and I'm just going to go file new

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
here and I'm just going to go file new
to<00:01:12.060> create<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> new<00:01:12.750> virtual<00:01:13.049> machine<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> then

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to create a new virtual machine and then

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
to create a new virtual machine and then
where<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.490> says<00:01:14.580> install<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
where it says install from I'm going to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
where it says install from I'm going to
go<00:01:17.070> ahead<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> choose<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.810> image<00:01:19.110> file<00:01:19.590> now

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
go ahead and choose an image file now

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.550 
go ahead and choose an image file now
this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> recent<00:01:20.970> image<00:01:21.479> file<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.409> can

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this is a recent image file so I can

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
this is a recent image file so I can
automatically<00:01:23.549> select<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.570> however<00:01:24.930> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
automatically select that however you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
automatically select that however you
might<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.460> through<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.150> browse<00:01:27.570> for

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
might have to go through and browse for

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
might have to go through and browse for
it<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.380> you'll<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.280> find<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:29.790> there

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it and you'll have to find it from there

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
it and you'll have to find it from there
but<00:01:30.600> again<00:01:30.869> mine<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.439> automatically<00:01:32.009> selected

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
but again mine is automatically selected

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.359 
but again mine is automatically selected
so<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.659> continue<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.710> now

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so I can just continue with that now

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
so I can just continue with that now
when<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> says<00:01:36.030> operating<00:01:36.900> system<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.979> can

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
when it says operating system if you can

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
when it says operating system if you can
do<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.759> make<00:01:39.240> sure<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:40.229> Windows

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
do this make sure you go more Windows

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.399 
do this make sure you go more Windows
and<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.250> other<00:01:41.549> windows<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.960> will<00:01:43.140> only

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and go other windows now some will only

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.550 
and go other windows now some will only
let<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.250> actual<00:01:45.030> Windows<00:01:45.570> versions<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
let you do actual Windows versions if it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.429 
let you do actual Windows versions if it
does<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.369> just<00:01:47.970> select<00:01:48.360> windows<00:01:48.840> 7<00:01:49.320> if

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
does that then just select windows 7 if

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.340 
does that then just select windows 7 if
not<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.490> select<00:01:50.970> other<00:01:51.210> windows<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.200> then

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
not then select other windows and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
not then select other windows and then
hit<00:01:52.590> OK<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.850> tells<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
hit OK and then here it just tells you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.999 
hit OK and then here it just tells you
the<00:01:54.240> location<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.079> virtual<00:01:55.409> machine<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the location of your virtual machine and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.490 
the location of your virtual machine and
you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.310> set<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> name<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.750> we'll

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you can set up a name for it so we'll

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
you can set up a name for it so we'll
just<00:01:58.710> call<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:58.979> Windows<00:01:59.670> 8<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.630> can

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
just call it Windows 8 and then you can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
just call it Windows 8 and then you can
just<00:02:01.229> create<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.040> here<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just create it so here it is and it is

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
just create it so here it is and it is
booting<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
booting up and now it will actually go

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.080 
booting up and now it will actually go
through<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> install<00:02:07.170> process<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
through the install process and just a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.300 
through the install process and just a
side<00:02:09.330> note<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> install<00:02:10.259> process<00:02:10.590> doesn't

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
side note the install process doesn't

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.910 
side note the install process doesn't
exactly<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:12.090> as<00:02:12.270> long

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
exactly take as long

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.000 
exactly take as long
with<00:02:13.099> Windows<00:02:13.610> 7<00:02:13.940> surprisingly<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.830> is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
with Windows 7 surprisingly so it is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.699 
with Windows 7 surprisingly so it is
faster<00:02:16.819> now<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.239> wasn't<00:02:17.540> actually<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.500> when

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
faster now I wasn't actually here when

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.949 
faster now I wasn't actually here when
it<00:02:18.860> was<00:02:18.890> installing<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.060> know<00:02:20.120> for<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> fact

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
it was installing but I know for a fact

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.949 
it was installing but I know for a fact
that<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.650> installed<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.580> lot<00:02:23.209> faster<00:02:23.840> than

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
that it installed a lot faster than

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.650 
that it installed a lot faster than
Windows<00:02:24.380> 7<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.190> once<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.640> loaded<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:26.540> you

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
Windows 7 so once it is loaded then you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.880 
Windows 7 so once it is loaded then you
can<00:02:26.900> continue<00:02:27.349> with<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.739> installation

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
can continue with the installation

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.090 
can continue with the installation
process<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.360> we're<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.830> go<00:02:30.950> ahead

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
process and we're just going to go ahead

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.670

and<00:02:31.610> select<00:02:31.970> next<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.630> then<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.530> hit

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
and select next and then you just hit

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.979 
and select next and then you just hit
install<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.790> then<00:02:35.060> accept<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.540> license

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
install now and then accept the license

install now and then accept the license
terms<00:02:36.350> hit<00:02:36.890> next<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:37.640> what<00:02:38.330> we're<00:02:38.510> gonna

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
terms hit next and then what we're gonna

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.809

do<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.080> go<00:02:39.319> custom<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.400> then<00:02:40.459> you're<00:02:40.610> going<00:02:40.730> to

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
do is go custom and then you're going to

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.750

select disk 0 unallocated space and you

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.850 
select disk 0 unallocated space and you
can<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.180> hit<00:02:44.330> next<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.290> will<00:02:45.470> start<00:02:45.769> to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
can just hit next and it will start to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.610 
can just hit next and it will start to
install<00:02:46.459> now<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.910> actually<00:02:47.600> already<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.319> it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
install now I actually already have it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.290 
install now I actually already have it
installed<00:02:48.830> so<00:02:49.610> I'm<00:02:49.700> just<00:02:49.880> going<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.060> go<00:02:50.180> ahead

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
installed so I'm just going to go ahead

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360 
installed so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:02:50.480> switch<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.900> over<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.230> my<00:02:51.319> other<00:02:51.530> virtual

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
and switch on over to my other virtual

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.910 
and switch on over to my other virtual
machine<00:02:52.670> here<00:02:52.940> where<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.569> already<00:02:53.989> set<00:02:54.290> up

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.680 

okay<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:01.580> we<00:03:01.730> are<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.150> actually<00:03:02.480> took<00:03:02.630> a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
okay and here we are it actually took a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.840 
okay and here we are it actually took a
lot<00:03:02.780> longer<00:03:03.260> than<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:04.100> boot<00:03:04.640> up

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
lot longer than that to boot up

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.000 
lot longer than that to boot up
primarily<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.320> was<00:03:06.470> setting<00:03:06.830> up<00:03:06.980> my

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
primarily because it was setting up my

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.640 
primarily because it was setting up my
PC<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.030> guess<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.390> has<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.780> do<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.110> every

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
PC and I guess it has to do that every

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.850 
PC and I guess it has to do that every
time<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:10.700> turn<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:11.270> your<00:03:11.540> computer<00:03:11.840> here<00:03:12.680> we

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
time you turn on your computer here we

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.340 
time you turn on your computer here we
are<00:03:12.890> in<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> tile<00:03:13.760> interface<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.690> if<00:03:15.230> you're

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
are in the tile interface and if you're

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.740 
are in the tile interface and if you're
familiar<00:03:15.560> with<00:03:15.890> Windows<00:03:16.610> 8<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:16.970> all<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:17.510> is

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
familiar with Windows 8 at all this is

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.660 
familiar with Windows 8 at all this is
basically<00:03:17.960> how<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:18.620> set<00:03:18.830> up<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:19.220> kind<00:03:19.550> of

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
basically how it's set up it's kind of

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.790 
basically how it's set up it's kind of
like<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:20.090> mixture<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.990> tablet<00:03:21.500> operating

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
like a mixture of a tablet operating

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.270 
like a mixture of a tablet operating
system<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:23.350> full-blown<00:03:24.350> operating<00:03:24.950> system

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
system and a full-blown operating system

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.280 
system and a full-blown operating system
that<00:03:25.370> you'd<00:03:25.520> find<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.970> computer<00:03:26.540> such<00:03:27.080> as

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
that you'd find on a computer such as

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.960 
that you'd find on a computer such as
Windows<00:03:27.740> 7<00:03:28.250> or<00:03:28.460> Mac<00:03:29.090> OS<00:03:29.360> X<00:03:29.810> Lion<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.760> go

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
Windows 7 or Mac OS X Lion so here we go

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.240 
Windows 7 or Mac OS X Lion so here we go
and<00:03:32.240> instead<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.990> Start<00:03:33.350> menu<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:33.770> get

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
and instead of the Start menu you get

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.310 
and instead of the Start menu you get
this<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.880> what<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:35.930> click

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
this and what you do is you just click

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.620 
this and what you do is you just click
on<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.220> brings<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:37.850> back<00:03:37.880> over<00:03:38.330> here

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
on it and it brings you back over here

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.300 
on it and it brings you back over here
so<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.140> not<00:03:39.320> necessarily<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.100> traditional

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
so it's not necessarily the traditional

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.850 
so it's not necessarily the traditional
Start<00:03:40.940> menu<00:03:41.270> but<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.780> still<00:03:42.050> called<00:03:42.380> Start

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
Start menu but it's still called Start

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.270 
Start menu but it's still called Start
and<00:03:43.070> once<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.240> store<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.200> open<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:45.920> once<00:03:46.100> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
and once the store is open and once the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.980
