00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you can put this in the blender if you'd

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.590 
you can put this in the blender if you'd
like<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.580> really<00:02:59.940> really<00:03:00.180> want<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.480> make

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
like if you really really want to make

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:09.710 
like if you really really want to make
sure<00:03:00.750> everything<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.350> mixed<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.920> well<00:03:08.720> and

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
sure everything is mixed in well and

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
sure everything is mixed in well and
then<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.590> great<00:03:10.860> project

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
then this is really great project

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.910 
then this is really great project
because<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.270> kind<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.570> just<00:03:12.770> how<00:03:13.770> much

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
because you can kind of just how much

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.280 
because you can kind of just how much
coverage<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.760> would<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:17.840> want<00:03:18.840> mine<00:03:18.990> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
coverage you would like I want mine to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.470 
coverage you would like I want mine to
be<00:03:19.320> medium<00:03:19.980> coverage<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.760> that's<00:03:21.000> why<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.240> put

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
be medium coverage so that's why I put

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.060 
be medium coverage so that's why I put
that<00:03:21.630> much<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.230> want<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.860> light

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
that much but if you want really light

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.360 
that much but if you want really light
coverage<00:03:23.280> use<00:03:23.790> black<00:03:24.090> powder<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:26.070> now<00:03:26.220> I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
coverage use black powder and now I'm

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.520 
coverage use black powder and now I'm
just<00:03:26.580> gonna<00:03:26.670> close<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.060> bag<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.959> mix<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just gonna close this bag up and mix it

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
just gonna close this bag up and mix it
more<00:03:28.800> why<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.550> still<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> bag<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:41.340> want

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
more why it's still in the bag you want

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.350 
more why it's still in the bag you want
to<00:03:41.640> kind<00:03:41.820> of<00:03:41.880> move<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.180> all<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.630> one<00:03:42.840> side<00:03:44.360> so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
to kind of move it all to one side so

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.510 
to kind of move it all to one side so
you<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.690> want<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.050> fold<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.440> like<00:03:46.620> this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
you just want to fold it like this

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.570 
you just want to fold it like this
and<00:03:47.730> snip<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.050> end

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.660 

and<00:03:55.450> then<00:03:55.750> pipe<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.290> into<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.190> bottle<00:03:57.550> that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
and then pipe it into the bottle that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:09.270 
and then pipe it into the bottle that
you<00:03:57.730> plan<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.270> using

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.670 

so<00:04:10.280> yeah<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.360> your<00:04:11.510> finished<00:04:11.960> product

and this is really great because you can

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.110 
and this is really great because you can
kind<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.290> adjust<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.010> how<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.160> want<00:04:16.340> if
