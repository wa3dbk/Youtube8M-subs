pass around your roll bar or mounting

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.550 
pass around your roll bar or mounting
frame<00:01:22.759> then<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> simply<00:01:24.539> tighten<00:01:25.289> up<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
frame then you can simply tighten up the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.309 
frame then you can simply tighten up the
clamp<00:01:25.969> to<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:26.999> appropriate<00:01:27.659> tension<00:01:28.079> and

clamp to the appropriate tension and

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.190 
clamp to the appropriate tension and
your<00:01:29.219> UTV<00:01:29.549> air<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:29.909> mounted<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.810> simple

your UTV air is mounted is very simple
now<00:01:31.889> we<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.420> preset<00:01:34.759> mounting<00:01:35.759> holes

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
now we do have two preset mounting holes

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.469 
now we do have two preset mounting holes
in<00:01:36.209> the<00:01:36.359> brackets

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.789 

that<00:01:40.479> way<00:01:40.630> if<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.869> choose<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.200> fix<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
bracket rather than use the clamp you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.190 
bracket rather than use the clamp you
can<00:01:45.520> do<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:45.880> however<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.479> want<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> check<00:01:46.990> with

that it is safe and acceptable to mount

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.039 
that it is safe and acceptable to mount
in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.520> application<00:01:55.210> or<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.690> area<00:01:56.020> that

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
on I'm going to take my clamp and simply

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.110 
on I'm going to take my clamp and simply
slide<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.799> through<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.450> clamp<00:03:48.690> slot<00:03:49.139> on<00:03:49.799> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
slide it through the clamp slot on the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:03.570 
slide it through the clamp slot on the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.000 

and<00:04:04.580> this<00:04:04.790> top<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.270> got<00:04:05.600> some<00:04:05.630> play<00:04:05.990> so<00:04:06.860> it's

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
and this top is got some play so it's

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:15.900 
and this top is got some play so it's
pretty<00:04:07.220> simple<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:08.330> get<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.600> through

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.150 

take<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.360> grill<00:04:16.570> gun<00:04:19.709> you're<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.860> to<00:04:20.980> put

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
take my grill gun you're going to put

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.020 
take my grill gun you're going to put
tension<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.670> the<00:04:21.790> clamp

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.510 

to<00:04:31.030> get<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.510> our<00:04:31.540> desired<00:04:31.750> tension<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.650> like<00:04:33.430> to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
to get to our desired tension I like to

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.550 
to get to our desired tension I like to
take<00:04:33.700> as<00:04:33.850> if<00:04:34.000> time<00:04:34.240> and<00:04:34.720> also<00:04:34.870> tie<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.290> around

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
take as if time and also tie this around

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.050 
take as if time and also tie this around
the<00:04:35.860> clamp<00:04:36.070> here<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.550> way<00:04:36.670> we<00:04:36.790> don't<00:04:36.880> have

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the clamp here that way we don't have

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.120 
the clamp here that way we don't have
any<00:04:37.210> extra<00:04:37.360> pieces<00:04:37.810> hanging<00:04:38.560> down<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.980> can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
any extra pieces hanging down you can

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.560 
any extra pieces hanging down you can
also<00:04:39.280> adjust<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.820> clamp<00:04:40.120> in<00:04:40.270> different

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
also adjust the clamp in different

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.000 
also adjust the clamp in different
positions<00:04:41.020> depending<00:04:41.230> on<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.770> application

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
positions depending on the application

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.140 
positions depending on the application
and<00:04:45.010> now<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.190> can<00:04:45.400> see<00:04:45.550> how<00:04:45.640> quick<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:45.940> easy
