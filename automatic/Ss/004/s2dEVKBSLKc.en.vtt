00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello to all and welcome either you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.720
 give or for another video that goes 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.429
 wearing this time on the nexus is that 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.750
 as you will have pained falling at 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.920
 google 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 I wish a little this morning actually I 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.540
 believe he is so this time ben 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 salah nexus is that jean to present 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 a plan yet it will not be a test 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 complete one is why not announced 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 necessarily the best place for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.109
 to test a product in depth 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.340
 rather a free survey and that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 interest me especially since the year of the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 set I did not have my test passed 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 very quickly in the hands because 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 I do not paint 15:18 and generates a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.739
 bargain a little bit more and not about you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 present it also times you do not 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 would know not much to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.469
 format level we follow with this 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.850
 I think it's a format 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.440
 interesting because everything depends on the uses 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.539
 but as much as for sedentary use 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 we will leave more on a tablet of 10 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 inch tone for nomad use 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.050
 I find that the 7-inch tablet and 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.090
 that even 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.820
 the right option what you need to know 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.379
 also melanie lollipop knows that we have a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.250
 new range say it is not bad 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.530
 of upheavals in the range 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.270
 recently since we went 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.100
 we saw a new lexus appear one 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.170
 large 32 gigas spaces of 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.860
 storage which means that the annexed 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.560
 at the stadium of saint gilles is reached 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.470
 and uremic suh stable and 32 gigas and at 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.060
 39 euros stupid things like that so it's 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.650
 true that this is to highlight one of the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.050
 cheapest tablets on the market with 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.580
 the kindle fire that however little it 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.040
 its proprietary system and so 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.140
 much less open than the year 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.760
 lollipop at the factors of blood 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.380
 including a 7-inch tablet which is 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.180
 rather than all the jets in fact 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 even to her congeners she is pretty 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.799
 pretty here I like the borders to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.880
 little metal so I'm front-facing 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.880
 was going when these two bubbles are there the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.110
 frontal sensor baton hint 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.330
 on the back we find a texture 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.400
 nate who will be so five peoples who 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 you will avoid fingerprints on 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 would also have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.220
 name will not have a back sensor 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 contrary to what was said happily 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.340
 what I mean about the other 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.810
 knows we know brown obviously nexus 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 is there just because it is produced by 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.420
 we have time to find a son 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.810
 find either at 3 lower right next 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.390
 we have the jack jack the pizza that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.420
 so would our helmet on the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.310
 right slice so we have the button 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.620
 by resigning and the two buttons 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.480
 scientist we control the volume either 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.920
 top slice we looked left 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 we have 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 we have nothing either if not here a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.989
 small connector that will allow us to 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.640
 place the swatter on a bug for the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.170
 reload to sync more 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.120
 quickly our files since we speak 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 de dom it is also necessary to know I did not 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.770
 not the teeth that is going to throw very 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.940
 soon an official dock so for 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.370
 the moment they say more on the site 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 japanese but it will happen here a few 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.590
 time in europe 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.520
 so in my opinion i think the front 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.840
 celebrations 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.260
 before the end of the year holidays we can 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.450
 enjoy the high level so water 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 is down side of android for us no 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720
 overlay 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.560
 there I think they did not do jeans 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.050
 marc parent will do so I think he 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 either blocked or 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.420
 You see it is so because the subject 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.340
 that it be accepted with the first 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.090
 version of jelly bean latest version 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.800
 that the nexus is could not actually 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.900
 switch the tablet to landscape mode 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.790
 it took a virtually update 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.200
 remaining however possible popular is 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.650
 the mandate of updates so that's 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.720
 possible 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.810
 therefore must take a trip to the ballet 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.780
 budget we always have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.739
 bailly if the dogma interests our 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.780
 different applications 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.739
 we obviously have different screens 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720
 which will allow us to 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.400
 spread our widget apps for 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.599
 create a coherent whole and that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.819
 will allow faster access to 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.160
 our resources where we have the 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.170
 notification center with the hour the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.330
 date the adp different modifications 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.910
 of our long and nautical applications 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.650
 north of basel julo twitter facebook 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.330
 that the mail box so on 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.150
 here we have a button that allows us to 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.470
 turn right from the notification if 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.489
 we will be able to see 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.810
 the user 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.880
 here in this case it's about Eric 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.200
 actresses we could change the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.380
 screen brightness access to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.970
 settings change access to the wifi that 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.480
 changes the rotation of the screen the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.069
 symbol ivz 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.170
 just now we can see the tatas 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.390
 homeland access airplane mode is native 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.360
 and or disable bluetooth 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.550
 after 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.620
 after after after listening it's 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.270
 so what if you have already put 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.440
 hand on a steam terminal you 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.470
 should not be caught off guard 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.730
 another portrait we have a presentation 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.160
 which is a little different in this 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.670
 meaning the search field appears from 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.340
 15 seats 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.500
 while in landscape mode there was here 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.110
 to two icons that allow us either 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 to launch traditional research 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.470
 to access the voice search 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.630
 so it's like aubry it's still 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.100
 quite fluid here below the finger 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.390
 we have the three touch buttons our 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.260
 plans we 'll be back back the 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.850
 back button on the screens 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.040
 home the access button to the mount which 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.050
 therefore the same task to transfer 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.760
 posters in the bottom of task bars have 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.050
 does a little side scan so 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.850
 ladies borrow the energy road 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 want to say good night do at the level 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.320
 at the application level so we have 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.750
 obviously that google so we 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.210
 all the homelands the google app 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.120
 google generic agenda 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.560
 google search on also has some 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.490
 native apps like ribery like 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.620
 lectra to manage your photos we will also have 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.760
 the remote media that will allow us to 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.860
 transform 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.790
 the tablet in remote control so that 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.980
 it is true that it is still enough 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.380
 practical since we will be able to control 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.930
 our TVs directly since the 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.450
 tablet then what is adopted 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.710
 an application we will see here 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.780
 spinning apps that have been 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.370
 installed as the subway app 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.320
 as virtua tennis and after Benjamin 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.170
 becker who is pretty much all of me 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.390
 also access to and double movie 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.570
 to beaver all the music that is 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.560
 released in France recently where we have 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.700
 always both English who is not 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.240
 master on support between 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.520
 applications 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.229
 the widgets and then finally from between 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.110
 10 and remove pure blood lies on 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:56.690
 nothing then necessarily I can the Belgian 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.069
 trouble the Belgian scored nor to test 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.330
 games the apps so we can not 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.009
 not tell you what it's really worth 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.009
 the terrain which is sure in any case 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.479
 it is a very beautiful object and 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.400
 I have to say I'm pretty 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.439
 seduced here so I had already had a 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.159
 positive attitude when was passed between 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:15.080
 hands I do not sleep more positive if you 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.369
 have some remarks that added should not 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.749
 hesitate comments are there for that 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.319
 and I will be very fast smartphone 

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.319
 out of Japan
