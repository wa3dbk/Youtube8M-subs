problem I want to be very clear about
this<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.140> recognizing<00:01:19.189> what<00:01:20.189> has

happened in Crimea the notion that a

course of two weeks would somehow

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
course of two weeks would somehow
justify<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.939> breaking<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.600> Crimea<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
justify the breaking off of Crimea and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.060 
justify the breaking off of Crimea and
the<00:01:34.560> annexation<00:01:34.979> by<00:01:35.159> Russia

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070

how the situation in Crimea evolves in
part<00:01:43.920> depends<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.610> making<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.450> the

part depends on making sure that the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.600 
part depends on making sure that the
international<00:01:45.810> community<00:01:46.369> stays<00:01:47.369> unified<00:01:48.200> in

indicating that this was an illegal

action on the part of Russia we have not

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.120 
action on the part of Russia we have not
gone<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.250> war<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.580> Russia<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.950> think<00:02:01.950> there's

gone to war with Russia I think there's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.460 
gone to war with Russia I think there's
a<00:02:02.190> significant<00:02:02.940> precedent<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.720> in<00:02:04.020> the

a significant precedent to that in the

a significant precedent to that in the
