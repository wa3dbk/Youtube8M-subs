00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.900
 all right 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.830
 hello I'm lupita today I'm going to 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.639
 show how to prepare some fajitas 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.460
 chicken in chipotle cream sauce 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.220
 We're going to need chicken breast, I already 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.850
 I have it here in some strips 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.710
 we have here also chipotle chiles 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.130
 the cream 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 we have a can of corn kernels 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.670
 Salt and chicken bouillon powder to taste 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.020
 let's start with our recipe what 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.620
 first thing we're going to do is put 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.790
 Fry our chicken in a pan with a 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.790
 little bit of vegetable oil 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.399
 I am occupying half a kilo of breast 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.399
 of chicken 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.909
 You can also do it with pieces of 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 whole chicken if you prefer I'll go 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.659
 to let my strips cool very well 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.729
 of chicken 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 and while we are going to put in the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 processor cream and chipotle chili 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.970
 I already have here then in the processor 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.860
 the cream the chipotle peppers and I'll 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.020
 add the chicken powder consommÃ© 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.460
 we will process can make a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 blender also if you like 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.140
 already started frying the chicken then 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.010
 I am now going to add 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 the tin of corn kernels of corn 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.280
 I uncovered the tin I put them in a strainer 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 or in a drainer 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.140
 and rinse these corn kernels I'm going to 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.650
 leave here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.000
 they start frying with the chicken 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.000
 to add a little salt 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.349
 the salts to your liking 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.050
 and I'll wait here for a few minutes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.190
 so that our 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.190
 corn kernels 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.390
 Here I have liquefied which is the cream 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.000
 that I'm going to add to the chicken so 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.360
 now let's empty it on our 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360
 arteries 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.490
 let's mix well 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.490
 Now this is starting to smell very rich 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.830
 let's leave here 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.860
 one 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.420
 five minutes or so 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.420
 to be able to serve them 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.990
 well then the cream with the chicken 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.890
 been boiling for about 5 minutes 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.390
 approximately and put out the fire like this 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.460
 that now we are going to serve 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.330
 Well, here we have our 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.910
 breast with corn kernels 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.990
 remember that we liquefy the cream with 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.760
 chipotle chilies 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.760
 this is how we have been 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.970
 as a bit spicy method 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.270
 If you want, add less chile 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 I add a can of the little ones 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.340
 they can add less spicy 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.670
 but the truth is that it is very rich 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.670
 chicken 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.230
