00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.900
 hello everyone welcome again to 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.820
 wild android today we are going to see a game 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.250
 sure we 're going to like it a lot 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.349
 it's true it's already a few months old but it's 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.900
 of this year and well more or less is 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.360
 recent now let's see when I load 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.570
 and you will see that it is quite worthwhile is a 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.700
 I play a little heavy that gives me a lot 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.119
 they are an almost a gigabyte installed are 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.670
 two but good so here you have it 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.129
 It's about the call of duty streak team 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.579
 It is not a novelty that incorporates 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.850
 some novelties based on the games 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.850
 previous 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.629
 to see a bit the operation is not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.629
 show 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.270
 let's start a mission so that 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.990
 You can see a little 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.670
 control how everything works and that 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.140
 may interest you as always 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.180
 links in the comments for 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.489
 you can download it as I commented before 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.700
 900 megas of unloading and two rows for 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.630
 install a device in a 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.630
 medium-high range 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.290
 more or less 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.390
 this good as the call of duty we with 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.390
 the goal and we have to move forward 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.790
 the problem in this game is a bit the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.270
 driving because to handle touching the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 screen that is a bit complicated 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.530
 we miss a mouse but let's go 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 totally because we move faster 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.570
 slower but good 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.340
 we take a bit of the point 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.500
 and more or less pointed out in which this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.130
 aims only then up mountains only 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 exactly 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.149
 While we have down as you can see a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.720
 series of options for sight 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.760
 montillo as it is called 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 we do not have to throw them out and well here 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.420
 we have grenades and to shoot the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.950
 problem is that when we eat 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.390
 we have pushing the screen if we 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.390
 We are wrong, we are going to expel 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.010
 what we have 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.920
 problems is the operation of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.690
 operation of the treatment 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.120
 I also got it, we're going to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.680
 do anything surely if we put it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.269
 facing the mouse is easy 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.269
 so just connect 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:47.620
 but moving it like that costs bumps that is not 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.189
 the same is always looking for a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.189
 I send 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.740
 let's take the ammunition that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.960
 we need 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.160
 meanwhile as the opposite 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.160
 it has graphics and of course 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.609
 ah 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.680
 two 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.160
 we are not watching radio was 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.160
 shooting out we go there 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:37.610
 that depends the mission we can control 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.610
 to strategy soldiers 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.310
 Let's go there 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:04:00.489
 what is this a lot is so high to move 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.489
 I think the game returns the tutorial 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.040
 the game will be a little bit to be formed 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.430
 I would not have interested as I did 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.680
 russian 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.240
 where 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.210
 that we have also taken on the mission 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.690
 created by waves we have to load 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.690
 to the enemies 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.520
 with exactly what we have to do 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.520
 c3 walking we expected more hilarious 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.880
 this is good for us to teach you a 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.770
 little much but it comes a bit bad 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.260
 to teach the view from above is a 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.560
 little what we also wanted to see two 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.560
 shapes 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.580
 cats 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.639
 but if we throw the grenade to change 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.719
 a little the subject 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.719
 reading and we come 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.520
 in the view is 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.000
 let's see where it is 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.749
 channeling to use 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 ah 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.219
 ah 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.219
 let's throw like they were many 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.180
 w 2 informed 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.100
 in this fantastic abuse for the 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.100
 coalition 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.030
 good 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.470
 is a bit limited with its sense 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.470
 we have nothing wrong 

00:06:51.989 --> 00:07:07.259
 sometimes it is possible to connect a keyboard 

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:07.259
 more complicated 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.969
 ok let's leave here vale solution 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:19.019
 We have been video for a long time 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:19.019
 basically at least 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.650
 then it was documented I'm going to leave 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.599
 the links in the comments so that 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.840
 you can not download in a way 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.840
 simple 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:37.830
 It's quite easy and everyone usually gives us 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:44.719
 no problem the only device 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:44.719
 medium that we have here 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:58.099
 ah 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:58.099
 Regards and see you 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.360
 to other many thanks for this
