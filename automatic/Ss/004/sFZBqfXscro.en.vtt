00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello everyone here speaks to you Jonathan and 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.219
 I bring you here a new gameplay and 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.879
 now it's the turn of call of duty modern 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 warfare 3 I think I played a little more 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.220
 what black ops 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.730
 but I do not like it as much as black ops 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 I liked black ops a lot even though I played 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.250
 first Carlos last of 4-3 but as 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.850
 that I settled more in the style of the cup 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.150
 now that does not mean no and how 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.010
 I said the other time 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:42.800
 I'm not very good at playing 4-3 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.140
 sometimes I complicate 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.930
 the matter that I like to be read by all 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.199
 sides all this but this heading in 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.870
 special was very strange because it was me 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.239
 it was too well online material and there 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.010
 someone who was changing I do not know by 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.010
 what I do not like in the blade I forget 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.710
 this machine was pretty round it 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 can you say since it was pretty good 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.619
 leave first before they see 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.119
 and it is clear because always never never 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.119
 I never do so well 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.730
 this year but good 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.870
 and well this map will bakarÃ¡ this is 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.240
 when the riot started 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.329
 I forgot to name it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.030
 and good this relationship when he recorded me 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.549
 commented my gameplays always the first 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.520
 example is that upload I will have recorded each 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.909
 gameplay like three or four times before 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.700
 say that this one was left and I said and now 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.039
 when this example decide better human 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.960
 I will record what comes out and what comes out 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.060
 I'm going to upload it so that something comes out 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.060
 more natural is something so pretended 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.080
 like the other videos 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:15.390
 where level 70 and something that I do not have a 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.850
 little to take out and cast 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.709
 I am very clear that it can be done with 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.420
 the prestige is the only thing that is clear 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.420
 it is clear to me that everything becomes zero 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.390
 good me late to be first 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.720
 It's so complicated, I'll see if I can take 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720
 the others 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 willow black ops' ending in the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.840
 black ops 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.840
 I hope it is not so complicated 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.060
 there is no that for the moment 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.849
 in helicopter 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.860
 and well there was the maximum point of my 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.860
 departure as with helicopter 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.130
 and other things that I had told him in 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.140
 the white one that said you look at them 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.140
 in the mold in watford 3 I did not like 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.570
 that was referring to occupy more the looks 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.599
 the blind side eyes of the iron 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.299
 weapons but with this measure the network 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.730
 dot it cost me I was getting used to it and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.640
 I know it's scary calls the best 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.620
 with 06 but I still do not like it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.240
 like he was riding and if you 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.070
 You lose juntitos has no will 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.690
 this one that puts it in the spotlight 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.600
 of another kind of form but 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.690
 like the old people come because I do not 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.920
 I know it's weird but more the point that now 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.459
 that transforms it has the look 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.840
 and well another thing that they say is 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.840
 also what 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.980
 I'm going to see if the new maps that are 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.830
 leaving the new ones and if I 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.100
 reach the money first because I think 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.450
 which is excess or the other would be to buy me 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:16.200
 the Corsican bla 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:19.690
 and I think we are advancing the money 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.760
 I do not have money income like me 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.820
 I wanted to and in the beginning I was 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.380
 working but well I'm not 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 working then it is not the same 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.820
 buy things for example the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 capturing hd that I had that I have now 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.290
 since I am when to see this I had 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.870
 an internal 3ds I understand it I 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.020
 changed for an xbox 360 in a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.790
 edition I'm left with the xbox but the 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.130
 goal was always to get the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.780
 capturing and at the end same fundelec 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.780
 box and I bought myself in the capturing 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.260
 Y 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.070
 and more I can comment 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:04.249
 I do not know how I'm seeing that fire more 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.399
 go up 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:11.439
 I have to finish by also so 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:11.439
 before finishing the game 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.970
 fairly good 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.479
 I hope you liked the video and if 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.669
 It's the first time that you see some of my 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.680
 videos subscribe to my channel so that 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.009
 YouTube tell you when I upload a 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.220
