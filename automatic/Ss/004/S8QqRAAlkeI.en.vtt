got enough PV 250 a try 280 and this of

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.560 
got enough PV 250 a try 280 and this of
course<00:00:16.869> is<00:00:17.200> a<00:00:17.230> zmr<00:00:17.710> 250<00:00:18.430> this<00:00:19.029> is<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.359> full

course is a zmr 250 this is the full

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.810 
course is a zmr 250 this is the full
carbon<00:00:19.930> fiber<00:00:20.289> frame<00:00:20.680> and<00:00:20.949> it<00:00:21.160> has<00:00:21.340> proven<00:00:21.670> to

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
carbon fiber frame and it has proven to

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.880 
carbon fiber frame and it has proven to
be<00:00:21.850> pretty<00:00:22.180> durable<00:00:22.420> I<00:00:22.810> have<00:00:23.439> a<00:00:23.470> lot<00:00:23.800> of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
be pretty durable I have a lot of

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.589 
be pretty durable I have a lot of
different<00:00:24.130> color<00:00:24.279> propellers<00:00:24.699> now<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.269> the

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
different color propellers now and the

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.759 
different color propellers now and the
propellers<00:00:25.990> on<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:26.289> seemed<00:00:26.500> to<00:00:26.590> change

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
propellers on it seemed to change

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.640 
propellers on it seemed to change
frequently<00:00:27.460> because<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:28.180> crash<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:28.599> lot<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.529> for

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
frequently because I crash a lot so for

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.670 
frequently because I crash a lot so for
the<00:00:29.740> next<00:00:29.890> multi<00:00:30.340> rotor<00:00:30.580> it<00:00:31.330> is<00:00:31.630> going<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.529> be

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the next multi rotor it is going to be

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.000 
the next multi rotor it is going to be
this<00:00:33.040> it<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:36.309> this<00:00:36.339> is<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.640> full

a<00:00:40.390> carbon<00:00:40.809> fiber<00:00:41.049> and<00:00:41.710> I'm<00:00:41.949> going<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.250> do<00:00:42.670> a

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
a carbon fiber and I'm going to do a

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.610 
a carbon fiber and I'm going to do a
little<00:00:42.909> review<00:00:43.239> of<00:00:43.299> this<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.750> tell<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.110> some

of my thoughts and impressions of it

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.549 
of my thoughts and impressions of it
compared<00:00:46.479> to<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.690> other<00:00:46.839> one<00:00:47.110> this<00:00:47.260> is<00:00:47.409> what

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
compared to the other one this is what

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.679 
that hold the top plate onto the
quadcopter<00:01:03.250> I'll<00:01:04.000> go<00:01:04.150> ahead<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.479> start

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
quadcopter I'll go ahead and start

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.480 
quadcopter I'll go ahead and start
measuring<00:01:05.199> how<00:01:05.590> thick<00:01:05.920> some<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.130> these<00:01:06.189> plates

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
measuring how thick some of these plates

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.610 
measuring how thick some of these plates
are<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:07.210> one<00:01:07.420> here<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.630> about<00:01:07.810> one<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.470> a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
are this one here is about one and a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.410 
are this one here is about one and a
half<00:01:08.650> millimeters<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:09.940> is<00:01:10.090> one<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.270> the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
half millimeters and this is one of the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.320 
half millimeters and this is one of the
base<00:01:10.780> plates<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.220> other<00:01:12.340> base<00:01:12.610> plate<00:01:12.910> feels<00:01:13.180> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
base plates the other base plate feels a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.540 
base plates the other base plate feels a
little<00:01:13.420> thicker<00:01:13.720> let's<00:01:14.080> see<00:01:14.260> now<00:01:14.860> about<00:01:15.370> one

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
little thicker let's see now about one

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.020 
little thicker let's see now about one
and<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:16.080> 1.5<00:01:17.550> 11.5<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.840> top<00:01:19.840> plate<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.000> a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
and a 1.5 11.5 to top plate is one and a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
and a 1.5 11.5 to top plate is one and a
half<00:01:22.180> millimeters<00:01:22.660> thick<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.520> arms<00:01:24.940> are

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
half millimeters thick and the arms are

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180 
half millimeters thick and the arms are
coming<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.160> about<00:01:27.840> 3.14<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.770> check<00:01:29.980> one<00:01:30.160> more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
coming in about 3.14 to check one more

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.320 
coming in about 3.14 to check one more
just<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.760> if<00:01:30.850> they're<00:01:30.970> all<00:01:31.060> pretty

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
just to see if they're all pretty

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.370 
just to see if they're all pretty
consistent<00:01:31.960> or<00:01:32.110> not<00:01:32.290> yeah<00:01:33.190> 3.11<00:01:33.730> 3.12<00:01:34.630> or

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
consistent or not yeah 3.11 3.12 or

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.410 
consistent or not yeah 3.11 3.12 or
pretty<00:01:35.590> good<00:01:35.770> there<00:01:36.120> so<00:01:37.120> with<00:01:37.300> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
pretty good there so with the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.490 
pretty good there so with the
measurements<00:01:37.900> out<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.140> way<00:01:38.260> I'll<00:01:38.350> go

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
measurements out of the way I'll go

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370 
measurements out of the way I'll go
ahead<00:01:38.650> and<00:01:38.740> use<00:01:38.860> camera<00:01:39.640> magic<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:41.230> like

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
ahead and use camera magic and just like

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.800 
ahead and use camera magic and just like
that<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.620> have<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> spacers<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
that I have the spacers in and it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.170 
that I have the spacers in and it
actually<00:01:43.840> has<00:01:44.409> two<00:01:44.650> extras<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.490> came<00:01:45.670> with<00:01:45.850> ten

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
actually has two extras it came with ten

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960 
actually has two extras it came with ten
and<00:01:46.540> I<00:01:46.960> think<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:47.650> only<00:01:47.800> eight<00:01:48.610> spaces

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
and I think there's only eight spaces

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.990 
and I think there's only eight spaces
for<00:01:49.420> spacers<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.830> arms<00:01:51.220> are<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.400> they<00:01:51.850> use

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
for spacers now the arms are on they use

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.980 
for spacers now the arms are on they use

the same except it has this hole on the
back<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.400> do<00:02:23.490> with<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
back and what you can do with that is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.190 
back and what you can do with that is
you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.060> drill<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.690> bit<00:02:24.780> larger

you can drill it out a little bit larger
and<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.950> put<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.340> cable<00:02:26.760> extension<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.630> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and you can put a cable extension in it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170 
and you can put a cable extension in it
like<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.530> your<00:02:28.800> antenna<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.060> way

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
like this for your antenna and that way

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
here bottom the bottom like this you can

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.010 
here bottom the bottom like this you can
tell<00:02:57.600> they're<00:02:58.130> pretty<00:02:59.130> much<00:02:59.280> identical<00:03:00.180> the

questions if I use two screws or four I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.000 
questions if I use two screws or four I
used<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.020> anyway

the arms you know that are on here all
are<00:03:28.680> all<00:03:29.040> original<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:30.270> anxious<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.630> see

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
are all original so I'm anxious to see

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.870 
are all original so I'm anxious to see
how<00:03:31.050> this<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.380> flies<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.980> handles<00:03:32.370> crashes

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
how this one flies and handles crashes

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.340 
how this one flies and handles crashes
because<00:03:33.000> they<00:03:33.270> say<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.570> fiberglass<00:03:33.930> is

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
because they say the fiberglass is

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.840 
because they say the fiberglass is
supposed<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.650> be<00:03:34.800> not<00:03:35.070> as<00:03:35.250> strong<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.760> then

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
supposed to be not as strong and then

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.310 
supposed to be not as strong and then
other<00:03:36.390> people<00:03:36.690> say<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:36.989> supposed<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.200> be

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
other people say it's supposed to be

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.440 
other people say it's supposed to be
stronger<00:03:37.830> than<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.070> carbon<00:03:38.370> fiber<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:38.970> if

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
stronger than the carbon fiber but if

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.820 
stronger than the carbon fiber but if
you<00:03:39.570> don't<00:03:39.750> crash<00:03:40.020> too<00:03:40.290> hard<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.590> guess<00:03:40.709> you

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you don't crash too hard I guess you

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.440 
you don't crash too hard I guess you
don't<00:03:41.010> you'll<00:03:41.160> never<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.239> guess

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
don't you'll never know so I guess

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.420 
don't you'll never know so I guess
that's<00:03:42.570> good<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.290> only<00:03:43.440> reason<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.830> think<00:03:44.310> this

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
that's good the only reason I think this

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.070 
that's good the only reason I think this
would<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.730> good<00:03:45.209> frame<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.570> start<00:03:45.630> with<00:03:45.959> this

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
would be a good frame to start with this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750 
would be a good frame to start with this
because<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.890> half<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.340> price<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
because it's it's half the price of the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.610 
because it's it's half the price of the
carbon<00:03:48.150> fiber<00:03:48.420> one<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.200> from<00:03:49.380> what<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.530> can

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
carbon fiber one and from what I can

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.320 
carbon fiber one and from what I can
tell<00:03:49.739> you<00:03:50.010> know<00:03:50.130> looks<00:03:50.400> pretty<00:03:50.670> solid<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.180> mean

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
tell you know looks pretty solid I mean

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.729 
tell you know looks pretty solid I mean
like<00:03:51.450> here<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:51.870> even<00:03:52.080> trying<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.380> bend<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
like here I'm even trying to bend the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.860 
like here I'm even trying to bend the
arms<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.790> I'm<00:03:54.150> not<00:03:54.390> hardly<00:03:54.600> getting<00:03:54.780> any

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
arms and you I'm not hardly getting any

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.229 
arms and you I'm not hardly getting any
bend<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.500> them<00:03:55.590> at<00:03:55.709> all<00:03:55.830> that's<00:03:56.670> good<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
bend out of them at all that's good the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.610 
bend out of them at all that's good the
top<00:03:57.480> plate<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.959> bottom<00:03:58.019> plate<00:03:58.350> little

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
top plate and the bottom plate little

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.750 
top plate and the bottom plate little
bit<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.860> leisure<00:03:59.070> because<00:03:59.340> they're<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> little

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
bit of leisure because they're a little

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.759 
bit of leisure because they're a little
bit<00:03:59.910> thinner<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:00.989> overall<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> really<00:04:01.650> like

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
bit thinner but overall I really like

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.290 
bit thinner but overall I really like
this<00:04:01.920> frame<00:04:02.220> I'm<00:04:02.430> anxious<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.730> get<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.150> in<00:04:03.209> the

this frame I'm anxious to get it in the
