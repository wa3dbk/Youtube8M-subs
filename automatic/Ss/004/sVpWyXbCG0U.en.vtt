00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.109
 Hello everyone, Kate, and today we are 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.390
 consider the game shadow era from wolf in 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.310
 game studios shadow aero presents 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.880
 a board game card genre 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.009
 fantasy 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 which is before the advent of video games and 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.300
 this day is very popular in america 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.929
 sorry until recently like 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.339
 entertainment 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.529
 especially made in decent quality 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.320
 for the tablet came out offensively enough 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.790
 but it's nice until recently 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.680
 see that developers are not easy 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.359
 released the usual handicraft for mobile 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.489
 devices were delivered immediately 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.989
 multiplatform option so in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.809
 favorite game you can play from 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.340
 usual while from the tablet plot shadow 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.140
 aero principle is simple and banal 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.359
 although in fact not for the plot we love 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.640
 similar games and for what is correct for 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.769
 cards and here you have to say them great 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.050
 many already at the time of writing the review 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.269
 the number of unique cards exceeded 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.769
 a mark of 300 pieces plus this figure will be 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.170
 grow with each update 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.640
 There are three types of creature cards in the game. 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.650
 spells and heroes 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.290
 roselyn wallpaper on the phases during which you 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.909
 can get new cards from the deck 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.400
 summon them on the battlefield and attack 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.570
 enemy creatures and the hero himself 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.799
 beating the one who let go of health 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.479
 enemy hero to 0 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.860
 also if you are not familiar with 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.140
 card game principles 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.820
 I advise you not to miss learning yet 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.619
 One nice moment was not require 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.420
 i.e. a real currency investment 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.220
 and of course you can purchase 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.170
 Ready decks and boosters for vital 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.240
 earned but playing a little longer 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.130
 You can do without in-game currency 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.229
 so it all depends on your 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.210
 experience and ingenuity by the way my concerns 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.310
 about internet addiction games so and 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.229
 not justified and we still allow 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.850
 play offline even in this mode 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.009
 understandably will have to get by just 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.579
 light companies without a duel with others 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.469
 by the players 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.600
 conclusion I can say what to play 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.520
 shadow era is very nice and interesting and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860
 even if you are still not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 played games of this type but world of 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.490
 warcraft for you are not empty words 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.649
 then be sure to download try 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.509
 brainchild goodwin studios so like art on 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.640
 cards give the atmosphere of the game to more 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.310
 similar to the creation of the great blizzard on 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.170
