00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello and welcome to my game of the month 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 let's prepare the batey game 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.250
 lore and it's a curious preparation because 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.230
 besides being a bit special like now 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 I had told you is a preparation in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 which since the minute one we have to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 have the two players sitting on the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 table so I'm going to look for marta 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.550
 because we need it to prepare this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 game in which she will play with the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.510
 hordes of the who to kill and I 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.580
 I will play with the gentlemen highlight to see 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 what happens she has promised that it will be the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.470
 stone ring rematch I'll have to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.150
 We are going to prepare it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.950
 then let's prepare then the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.960
 starting we have what the first step is 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.420
 and good I'll play with the lords here 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 it marks me with the cars and the hours of a 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.390
 tequila 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.990
 the first thing is to take the letters from 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.430
 scenario of each faction we lower the 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.020
 tarot-sized letters that both 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 liked and we choose 3.0 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.009
 that we will see you have the three 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.210
 we will also see them and we will choose 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.210
 one now we go back 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.420
 Well we have the letter has decided the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.400
 mine knows one is to give one of a tie 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.970
 in initiative, it must be decided by the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.970
 eyes of all 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.090
 the swords without the initial 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.299
 an initiative 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.490
 by then then the child is called 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.439
 content forgiveness with giving in the river very 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.119
 now the damaged units ie 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.280
 mine do not have to finish their 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.750
 movement when moving to a hex that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.369
 contain a ford record remember 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.259
 the chips are placed ford 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.850
 now at the beginning of the clock we will see what 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.219
 they stop the movement of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.979
 units that go into them mine 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.420
 for the stage I pass victory points 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.969
 out at a victory point for each 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.490
 Goal unit that meets only ally 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:12.250
 a hex that contains a tab ba 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.410
 interesting the darn clear 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 forest worms do not limit 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.370
 amounts of dice thrown by 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.640
 allied units to make runs of 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.680
 I fight and I get a point of victory 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.970
 for every three students of forest occupied 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 for a wise level 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.750
 Therefore, in its case, its units do not 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.470
 mine have no penalty in the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.420
 forests 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.590
 I am have I have hashish and those who 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.020
 You get victory points when 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.240
 you have to 32 schools to 3 forests 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.360
 so busy we are going to assemble the board 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.400
 It is according to letters both this and this 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.890
 you know it was like this we will ride now 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.580
 same board and we went to one of the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.530
 units now we are to kill 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.090
 well it is placed we have a problem 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.480
 with a diaz piece is that in the lace 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.840
 of the river that you see here should 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.340
 connect but we need here a 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.930
 piece just like this one because the river has 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.270
 to connect here and have to leave 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.190
 towards there and it turns out that in the pieces 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.230
 that we have available there is no 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.880
 base we have made there is only one with 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.870
 that way of and there's another one with another of 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.630
 way of and is but would not fit the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.980
 the same way there does not fit us because 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.200
 I would come out here not here and not 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.350
 we can give it a spin so we do not 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 there is no other way than to unite it in a 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.740
 straight 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.080
 but they would have put us some 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.310
 piece also because we have even seen 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.320
 those that are on the table we have given 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.430
 the turn or if it was on the other side 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.060
 of some of those that we have not 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.810
 contemplated but it is not the case so 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.270
 now everything is assembled 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.520
 we need to place two payments one you and 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.130
 noia as well as the initiative 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:49.530
 placed mine and I'll place it 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.840
 here and yours seems to me to be 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.810
 limited by where you can place according to 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.090
 your deployment 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.380
 it would be there yes because in your letter 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.700
 deployment here you have to place a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.090
 miniature that places me a miniature 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.890
 It has to be a stick 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.020
 so the fords willing 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.940
 the deployment charts also only 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.319
 we have to choose the army 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.740
 let's go, as I said, let's use the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.100
 Three letters 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.930
 of each faction with pre- armies 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.290
 built to select ours 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.290
 now 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.360
 but then we have the letter in my 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.180
 Army make up subjects 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.880
 for now we are going to place the letters in 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.680
 the boxes and now we go back 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.510
 well we have as you see the board 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.010
 totally dealt with the letters of 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.620
 mile in the lures we do not know what's 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.460
 under each one so we're going to 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.150
 reveal the already place the thumbnails 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.360
 we go 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.980
 well prepared the board that look 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.840
 for referring to see without being of 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.460
 cowardly prepared the board as you see 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.770
 quite spectacular although not so 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.990
 full as it seemed with the charges we 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.090
 it is you have two points to know by 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.129
 your army recruitment I have 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.899
 my initial player tab 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:09.330
 we have our character cards 

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:11.789
 ok and we need to catch each 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:16.909
 one three letters of good knowledge for each 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:16.909
 one more of his action and we take 3 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.280
 and the command that are there 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.990
 that we did not have them we did not have them 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.349
 hand the letters of command counted the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.389
 two we leave it there for example there are 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.310
 to take six each and one two three 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.890
 four five and six for me 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.260
 3 4 5 and 6 for you let's leave them for 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.640
 here and now of the letters of knowledge 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.340
 we have to see the three we have 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.040
 each one and discard one the part of 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.720
 down the deck that will be the last 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.670
 take if we got to tell our 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.890
 we will really pick it up and from the 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.450
 six that we have donating we will have to 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.920
 stay with two or we have to 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.510
 discard two to stay with four 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.510
 let's choose and now we come back 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.170
 Well now we have everything ready 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.910
 there are four control cards left in your hand 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.460
 what is it with which it starts and the letters 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.440
 to know right 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.640
 ok I want to comment something about you 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:17.240
 choice of positions or units that 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.910
 people know why and how they are going to stop 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.640
 well you also have that's true 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.470
 well thought out will I tell you why only 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.000
 that is experiencing without one of 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.110
 my victory options is a point 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.060
 of victory every time a goal in 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.110
 public is on the side because I do not have 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.700
 the only ones 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.230
 -I'm pretending to play with a 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.970
 strategy a little more risky but 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.820
 that maybe I can see the victory more 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.500
 we'll quickly see how it goes 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.390
 Well, you have been prepared to start the 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.630
 departure do not miss tomorrow 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.630
 we started 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:50.060
 all this table ready board 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.569
 all very nice to come we started not to what 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.710
 lose 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:53.710
 thanks for your time
