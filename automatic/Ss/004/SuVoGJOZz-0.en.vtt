sodas we're going to compare here with
the<00:00:26.640> pH<00:00:27.000> chart<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.849> 7.0<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the pH chart as you can see 7.0 is the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
the pH chart as you can see 7.0 is the
green<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.320> full<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.369> 7.2

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
green and that is a full about 7.2

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.870 
green and that is a full about 7.2
really<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.660> neutral<00:00:34.140> pH<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:35.370> they<00:00:35.640> start

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
really is a neutral pH as they start

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.220 
really is a neutral pH as they start
getting<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.270> lighter<00:00:36.480> greens<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.140> yellows

getting the lighter greens and yellows

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
getting the lighter greens and yellows
and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> oranges<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.280> becomes<00:00:38.550> very<00:00:38.820> sick

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and the oranges it becomes very sick

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
and the oranges it becomes very sick
this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.170> sickness<00:00:40.710> happens<00:00:41.129> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this is where sickness happens because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.680 
this is where sickness happens because
the<00:00:42.239> body

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the body

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.459 
the body
excuse<00:00:43.350> me<00:00:43.469> diseases<00:00:43.980> cannot<00:00:44.399> live<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:46.020> an

excuse me diseases cannot live in an
alkaline<00:00:46.800> environment<00:00:47.460> but<00:00:47.789> yet<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.149> thrive

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
alkaline environment but yet they thrive

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
alkaline environment but yet they thrive
in<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> city<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.620> room<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.219> gonna

in a city good by room so you're gonna
see<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.520> sickness<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.750> when<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
see the sickness is down here when the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
see the sickness is down here when the
pH<00:00:52.410> level<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> body<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.489> very<00:00:53.910> low<00:00:54.329> then

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pH level of the body is very low then

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.240 
pH level of the body is very low then
we're<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> come<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.160> you're

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
going to see as we get to the blues and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
going to see as we get to the blues and
the<00:00:57.719> purples<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.649> becomes<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.309> alkaline

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the purples it becomes very alkaline

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.840 
the purples it becomes very alkaline
again<00:01:00.449> diseases<00:01:01.410> cannot<00:01:01.949> grow<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.640> an

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
environment the first one that we're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
environment the first one that we're
going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> start<00:01:09.840> off<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.650> two

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
going to start off with is a one two

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.250 
going to start off with is a one two
you're<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.220> far<00:01:11.549> left<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.689> today<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you're very far left here now today we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're very far left here now today we
use<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> 7up<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> really

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
use this 7up but this is really

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200 
use this 7up but this is really
basically<00:01:15.630> true<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:17.040> carbonated<00:01:17.790> drinks

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
basically true of all carbonated drinks

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
basically true of all carbonated drinks
and<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.450> sodas<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> sport<00:01:19.560> Greeks<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and all sodas and sport Greeks the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.310 
and all sodas and sport Greeks the
reason<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:20.970> use<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.270> 7up<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.960> because

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
reason why we use the 7up is because

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.020 
reason why we use the 7up is because
it's<00:01:22.500> clear<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.340> testing<00:01:23.610> these

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it's clear so when you're testing these

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
it's clear so when you're testing these
even<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> want<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> test<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.470> Gatorade<00:01:25.860> you

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
even if you want to test a Gatorade you

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.440 
even if you want to test a Gatorade you
need<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> make<00:01:26.549> sure<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> clear

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
need to make sure that you get the clear

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.690 
need to make sure that you get the clear
one<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.829> drops<00:01:29.070> we're<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.610> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
one because the drops we're gonna put in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
one because the drops we're gonna put in
you<00:01:29.790> won't<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> true<00:01:30.360> reading<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you won't get a true reading if it's a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
you won't get a true reading if it's a
color<00:01:31.320> drink<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> carbonated<00:01:33.420> drinks

the<00:02:51.060> back<00:02:51.300> there<00:02:51.540> thinking<00:02:52.050> again<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.380> was

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the back there thinking again I was

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.260 
the back there thinking again I was
drinking<00:02:53.130> fairly<00:02:53.490> healthy<00:02:53.670> water

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
drinking fairly healthy water

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.090 
drinking fairly healthy water
well<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.870> was<00:02:55.110> removing<00:02:55.590> some<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
well I was removing some of the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.800 
well I was removing some of the
chemicals<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> certainly<00:02:57.209> wasn't<00:02:57.480> take

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
chemicals it certainly wasn't take

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.949 
chemicals it certainly wasn't take
changing<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.470> pH<00:02:58.680> level<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.330> water<00:03:00.720> out<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
changing the pH level so my water out of

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.320 
changing the pH level so my water out of
my<00:03:01.080> filtration<00:03:01.740> system<00:03:02.190> come<00:03:02.820> out<00:03:03.000> between
