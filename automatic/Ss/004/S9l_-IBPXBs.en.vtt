00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.440 
and again same thing goes for a little
frosting<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.930> adhere<00:02:11.320> them<00:02:11.440> together<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
then maybe just position it okay off

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.000 
then maybe just position it okay off
there<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.240> now<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.840> time<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.050> crumb<00:02:20.560> coat
