00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
little thing a lot of people don't know
that<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:56.969> are<00:01:57.000> private<00:01:57.360> channels<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.810> if

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that there are private channels and if

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
that there are private channels and if
