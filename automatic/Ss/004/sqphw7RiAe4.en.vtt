got here this is a pretty neat new

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.999 
got here this is a pretty neat new
system<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.240> got<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.960> excellent<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.950> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
system you got this is excellent this is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.580 
system you got this is excellent this is
the<00:00:14.340> exo<00:00:14.700> terra<00:00:14.730> monsoon<00:00:15.590> high-pressure

the exo terra monsoon high-pressure
rainfall<00:00:17.190> system<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.330> basically<00:00:18.810> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
rainfall system this is basically a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.349 
rainfall system this is basically a
misting<00:00:19.890> system<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.640> rain<00:00:20.970> forest

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
misting system for rain forest

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.630 
misting system for rain forest
terrariums<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.500> allows<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.250> keep<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
terrariums this allows you to keep the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.580 
terrariums this allows you to keep the
right<00:00:23.850> community<00:00:24.449> within<00:00:24.660> your<00:00:24.960> rain<00:00:25.170> forest

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
right community within your rain forest

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910 
right community within your rain forest
sets<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:27.119> we<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.900> they<00:00:28.740> have

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
sets and how we do that is they have

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
sets and how we do that is they have
these<00:00:29.070> fine<00:00:29.490> misting<00:00:30.060> spray<00:00:30.449> nozzles<00:00:31.410> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
these fine misting spray nozzles that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
these fine misting spray nozzles that
shoot<00:00:32.250> water<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:33.630> do<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.840> shoot<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
shoot water and when do they shoot the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
shoot water and when do they shoot the
water<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.739> great<00:00:34.980> thing<00:00:35.160> about<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
water this is a great thing about this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
water this is a great thing about this
you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:36.000> set<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> timer<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.950> can

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you can set this on a timer so you can

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.630 
you can set this on a timer so you can
have<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> run<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> 24<00:00:41.190> hour<00:00:41.340> cycle

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

you<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> run<00:00:42.600> once<00:00:43.230> every<00:00:43.559> hour<00:00:43.590> once

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you can have it run once every hour once

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.250 
you can have it run once every hour once
every<00:00:44.399> two<00:00:44.579> hours<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
every two hours or if you want you can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just press the button and it will go on

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
just press the button and it will go on
its<00:00:47.940> own<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.140> great<00:00:49.379> thing<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.590> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
its own but the great thing about this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.279 
its own but the great thing about this
is<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> set<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> timer<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.629> not

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is when you set the timer on this not

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
is when you set the timer on this not
only<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.309> timing<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.270> have

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
only do you have the timing or you have

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
only do you have the timing or you have
the<00:00:54.449> duration<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.680> set<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.370> rain<00:00:56.640> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the duration you can set this to rain on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.900 
the duration you can set this to rain on
your<00:00:57.469> terrarium<00:00:58.469> anywhere<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:58.980> two<00:00:59.399> seconds

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
your terrarium anywhere from two seconds

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
your terrarium anywhere from two seconds
to<00:01:00.109> 120<00:01:01.109> per<00:01:01.230> second<00:01:01.530> while<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.829> made<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
to 120 per second while they made it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
to 120 per second while they made it
really<00:01:02.219> easy<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> lot<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.270> times<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really easy because a lot of times the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.960 
really easy because a lot of times the
systems<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.430> program

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
systems have you have to really program

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
systems have you have to really program
them<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> wow<00:01:07.439> okay<00:01:07.470> I'm<00:01:08.040> just

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
them this is like wow okay I'm just

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.850 
them this is like wow okay I'm just
going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> set<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.760> every<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.420> hours<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.170> wanted

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
going to set it every two hours I wanted

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700 
going to set it every two hours I wanted
to<00:01:10.920> go<00:01:11.159> off<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.400> two<00:01:12.119> minutes<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
to go off for two minutes this is that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
to go off for two minutes this is that
that's<00:01:13.890> exactly<00:01:14.520> what<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.150> really

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that's exactly what it is it's really

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
that's exactly what it is it's really
kind<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.990> set<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.530> forget<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
kind of like set it and forget it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
kind of like set it and forget it
basically

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
basically

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000 
basically
and<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.630> much<00:01:18.810> water<00:01:19.110> does<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.500> system<00:01:19.680> hold

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
and how much water does this system hold

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.890 
and how much water does this system hold
this<00:01:20.430> system<00:01:20.820> holds<00:01:21.000> approximately<00:01:21.690> one

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this system holds approximately one

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
this system holds approximately one
gallon<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.380> water<00:01:22.650> which<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.550> plenty<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.030> do

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
gallon of water which is plenty to do

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
gallon of water which is plenty to do
for<00:01:24.420> quite<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.810> long<00:01:24.960> time<00:01:25.170> oh<00:01:25.590> yeah<00:01:25.800> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
for quite a long time oh yeah and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
for quite a long time oh yeah and
depending<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.870> you<00:01:28.020> set<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
depending on how how much you set this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.980 
depending on how how much you set this
up<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:28.710> how<00:01:28.830> timing<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> duration<00:01:30.300> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
up and how timing and the duration you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
up and how timing and the duration you
know<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.260> could<00:01:31.290> last<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> anywhere<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
know this could last you anywhere for a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
know this could last you anywhere for a
couple<00:01:32.460> days<00:01:32.550> three<00:01:32.940> days<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
couple days three days you know it's

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140 
couple days three days you know it's
really<00:01:34.650> great<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:35.970> great

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
so on this particular system will do it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.969 
so on this particular system will do it
we've<00:02:06.600> talked<00:02:06.840> about<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.080> do<00:02:07.260> eight<00:02:07.500> nozzles

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
we've talked about it do eight nozzles

we've talked about it do eight nozzles
well<00:02:08.280> how<00:02:08.369> does<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.820> do<00:02:09.300> did<00:02:09.780> their

well how does it do that do did their

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.810 
well how does it do that do did their
connecting<00:02:10.440> pieces<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.160> there's<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.459> simple

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
connecting pieces or up there's a simple

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.160 
connecting pieces or up there's a simple
cord<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.150> comes<00:02:12.270> out<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> back<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.020> then

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
cord that comes out the back and then

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.870 
cord that comes out the back and then
you<00:02:13.290> put<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> diverter<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.730> can

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
you put a diverter on it and you can

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.580 
you put a diverter on it and you can
divert<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.570> eight<00:02:15.720> times<00:02:15.990> that's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
divert it up to eight times that's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.550 
divert it up to eight times that's
incredible<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.180> really<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.780> nice<00:02:19.080> system
