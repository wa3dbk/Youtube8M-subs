00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.889 
was very curious when I saw this since
when<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> Cintiq<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.180> Cintiq<00:01:51.509> came<00:01:51.720> out

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
when the Cintiq and the Cintiq came out

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
when the Cintiq and the Cintiq came out
how<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.250> work<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.700> it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
how it's going to work out because it's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.730 
how it's going to work out because it's
quite<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> massive<00:01:54.920> piece<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> gadget<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.869> I

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
quite a massive piece of gadget but I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
quite a massive piece of gadget but I
feel<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.759> ergonomic<00:02:00.270> arm<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> quite

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
feel that the ergonomic arm is quite

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
feel that the ergonomic arm is quite
good<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.469> move<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> Cintiq<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> down

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
good you can move the Cintiq up and down

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
good you can move the Cintiq up and down
easily<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.930> thing<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> found<00:02:04.680> most

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
easily the thing that I found most

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.910 
easily the thing that I found most
useful<00:02:05.159> about<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> device<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> size<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
useful about the device is the size that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.440 
useful about the device is the size that
you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.250> keep<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> tools<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> your

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
you can keep all the tools and your

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.199 
you can keep all the tools and your
artwork<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.379> space<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.979> use<00:02:11.430> mostly<00:02:11.760> 2d

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
artwork in the one space I use mostly 2d

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.429 
artwork in the one space I use mostly 2d
software

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
software

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.319 
software
I<00:02:13.469> haven't<00:02:14.069> tried<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.519> 3d<00:02:14.849> software<00:02:15.030> and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
I haven't tried the 3d software and

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.270 
I haven't tried the 3d software and
Cintiq<00:02:15.689> yet<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.530> be<00:02:16.650> curious<00:02:16.859> to<00:02:17.069> see

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
Cintiq yet so I would be curious to see

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.879 
Cintiq yet so I would be curious to see
how<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.359> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.689> work<00:02:18.719> work<00:02:19.349> out<00:02:19.560> with<00:02:19.859> a

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:19.889 
how it's going to work work out with a

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:31.470 
how it's going to work work out with a
software<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.549> moto<00:02:20.790> ZBrush<00:02:21.420> yeah<00:02:22.280> all<00:02:23.280> right

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480
