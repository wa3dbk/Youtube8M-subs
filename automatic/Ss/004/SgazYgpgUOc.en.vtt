pushing it a bit too far a feature like
this<00:02:59.180> surely<00:02:59.630> would<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.780> made<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.110> into<00:03:00.380> the

this surely would have made it into the
trailer<00:03:00.710> what<00:03:01.220> keeps<00:03:01.430> me<00:03:01.640> believing<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.300> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
trailer what keeps me believing is the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.600 
trailer what keeps me believing is the
fact<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.840> if<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.200> recall<00:03:03.530> Bethesda<00:03:04.400> hid
