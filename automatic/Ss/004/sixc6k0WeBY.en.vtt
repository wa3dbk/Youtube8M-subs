00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
Jaguars down the straight where the cars

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.479 
Jaguars down the straight where the cars
reach<00:02:18.910> roughly<00:02:19.290> 245<00:02:20.290> 250<00:02:20.920> miles<00:02:21.070> an<00:02:21.190> hour<00:02:21.280> here

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
reach roughly 245 250 miles an hour here

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.250 
reach roughly 245 250 miles an hour here
the<00:02:21.640> Porsches<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.540> Jaguar<00:02:22.930> already

among them yes Lammers moving into third
place<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.230> think<00:02:26.290> splitting<00:02:26.829> the<00:02:26.920> Porsche<00:02:27.160> team

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
place I think splitting the Porsche team

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.780 
place I think splitting the Porsche team
already<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.920> Wallach<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.190> stuck<00:02:30.459> ahead

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
already there is Wallach and stuck ahead

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.360 
already there is Wallach and stuck ahead
of<00:02:30.910> him<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.570> Andretti's<00:02:32.079> behind<00:02:32.410> him<00:02:32.620> and

of him the Andretti's behind him and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.130 
of him the Andretti's behind him and
then<00:02:33.549> his<00:02:33.730> teammate<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.390> number<00:02:34.600> one<00:02:34.780> car<00:02:35.109> of

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
then his teammate the number one car of

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.949 
then his teammate the number one car of
Neilson<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.709> Brundle<00:02:36.480> now<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.630> interesting

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
Neilson and Brundle now it's interesting

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.229 
Neilson and Brundle now it's interesting
also<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.769> keep<00:02:38.980> an<00:02:39.160> eye<00:02:39.280> out<00:02:39.310> for<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:39.940> other

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
also to keep an eye out for that other

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.470 
also to keep an eye out for that other
Jaguar<00:02:40.900> there<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.709> number<00:02:42.430> 22<00:02:43.120> car

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
Jaguar there that's the number 22 car

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.890 
Jaguar there that's the number 22 car
the<00:02:44.489> comparatively<00:02:45.489> slow<00:02:45.940> car<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:46.420> practice

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
the comparatively slow car in practice

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.390 
the comparatively slow car in practice
but<00:02:47.049> they're<00:02:47.260> all<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> first

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
but they're all up there in the first

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.370 
but they're all up there in the first
ten<00:02:48.700> also<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.420> obviously<00:02:49.780> nobody's<00:02:50.079> gonna<00:02:50.200> lie

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
ten also so obviously nobody's gonna lie

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.680 
ten also so obviously nobody's gonna lie
back<00:02:50.590> too<00:02:50.829> far

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
back too far

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.090 
back too far
now<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.020> course<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.320> very<00:02:53.440> much<00:02:53.620> part<00:02:53.920> of<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
now of course a very much part of the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.830 
now of course a very much part of the
team<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.580> Americans<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.120> come<00:02:55.300> over<00:02:55.660> from
