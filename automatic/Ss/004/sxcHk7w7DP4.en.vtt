played in elevators I'm I was fascinated

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.340 
played in elevators I'm I was fascinated
by<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> idea<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:40.160> who<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.730> came<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.059> with

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
by the idea of who first came up with

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
by the idea of who first came up with
the<00:00:43.350> concept<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.890> putting<00:00:44.190> music<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the concept of putting music in

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
the concept of putting music in
elevators<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> why<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:45.930> did<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> why<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
elevators and why they did and why it's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.670 
elevators and why they did and why it's
still<00:00:47.610> done<00:00:47.730> today<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:49.350> also<00:00:49.469> interested

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
still done today I was also interested

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.090 
still done today I was also interested
in<00:00:50.239> why<00:00:51.239> there<00:00:51.480> wasn't<00:00:51.660> staying<00:00:52.110> music<00:00:52.559> I've

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
in why there wasn't staying music I've

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.060 
in why there wasn't staying music I've
always<00:00:53.399> wanted<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.300> know<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
always wanted to know that you know it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.240 
always wanted to know that you know it
seems<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.699> me<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.960> music<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.250> better

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
seems to me that music would be better

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.290 
seems to me that music would be better
to<00:00:59.609> have<00:01:00.620> piped<00:01:01.620> into<00:01:01.980> flights<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> stairs

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to have piped into flights of stairs

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
to have piped into flights of stairs
because<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:04.350> climbing<00:01:05.040> stairs<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.519> much<00:01:05.700> more

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because of climbing stairs as much more

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.730 
because of climbing stairs as much more
arduous<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.840> tedious<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.350> often<00:01:07.590> takes

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
arduous and tedious and often takes

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
arduous and tedious and often takes
longer<00:01:08.100> than<00:01:08.130> riding<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.270> elevator<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.020> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
longer than riding in an elevator so it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
longer than riding in an elevator so it
didn't<00:01:10.380> make<00:01:10.590> sense<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.720> who<00:01:12.720> saw<00:01:13.939> elevator

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
didn't make sense to me who saw elevator

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.789 
didn't make sense to me who saw elevator
music<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.750> trying<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
music as then trying to be nice and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
music as then trying to be nice and
entertain<00:01:17.220> whoever's<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> elevator<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
entertain whoever's in the elevator I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
entertain whoever's in the elevator I
didn't<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.159> deserving<00:01:20.759> music<00:01:21.330> more

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
didn't see it as deserving music more

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.859 
didn't see it as deserving music more
than<00:01:21.680> walking<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.890> stairs<00:01:23.360> but<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.540> I've

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
than walking up stairs but now I've

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.690 
than walking up stairs but now I've
researched<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.590> history<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.950> elevator<00:01:26.340> music

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
researched the history of elevator music

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
researched the history of elevator music
I<00:01:26.880> understand<00:01:27.630> why<00:01:27.930> there's<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.259> stayin

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
I understand why there's not stayin

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.510 
I understand why there's not stayin
music<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> why<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.729> elevator<00:01:30.150> music

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
music and why there is elevator music

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
music and why there is elevator music
essentially<00:01:32.600> elevator<00:01:33.600> music<00:01:33.960> seems<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> have

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
essentially elevator music seems to have

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.600 
essentially elevator music seems to have
been<00:01:35.810> invented<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> were<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.710> people

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
been invented as it were because people

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
been invented as it were because people
were<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:38.970> nervous<00:01:39.180> riding<00:01:39.840> elevators<00:01:40.140> at

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
were very nervous riding elevators at

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.420 
were very nervous riding elevators at
first<00:01:41.360> they<00:01:42.360> didn't<00:01:42.630> trust<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.439> new<00:01:43.770> device

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
first they didn't trust this new device

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.260 
first they didn't trust this new device
and<00:01:44.729> contraption<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> music<00:01:48.090> also

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and contraption and and the music also

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and contraption and and the music also
helped<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.070> disguise<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:51.079> clanking<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
helped to disguise the clanking and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
helped to disguise the clanking and
screeching<00:01:52.829> noises<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.430> old<00:01:53.610> elevators

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
screeching noises that old elevators

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
screeching noises that old elevators
used<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.630> some<00:01:55.439> still<00:01:55.829> make<00:01:55.979> them<00:01:56.159> today

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
used to make some still make them today

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
used to make some still make them today
and<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.320> would<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> music

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and and so it would you know the music

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
and and so it would you know the music
was<00:01:59.310> designed<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> calm<00:01:59.909> people<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.450> make

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
was designed to calm people and make

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630 
was designed to calm people and make
people<00:02:00.990> feel<00:02:01.259> safer<00:02:01.770> while<00:02:01.920> riding<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.460> these

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
people feel safer while riding in these

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.999 
people feel safer while riding in these
odd<00:02:02.960> devices<00:02:04.850> why<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.000> persisted<00:02:06.600> today<00:02:07.009> I'm

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
odd devices why it's persisted today I'm

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.160 
odd devices why it's persisted today I'm
not<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.399> sure<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.940> could<00:02:09.420> still<00:02:09.660> be<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.989> for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
not so sure it could still be there for

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.559 
not so sure it could still be there for
the<00:02:10.259> same<00:02:10.440> reason<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:11.069> know<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.849> lot<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.180> a
