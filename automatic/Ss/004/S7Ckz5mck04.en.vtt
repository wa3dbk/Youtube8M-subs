basically what he said was that 93 to 95
percent<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.439> pc<00:01:19.830> games<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.310> there

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
percent of the pc games out there

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.510 
percent of the pc games out there
they're<00:01:21.270> pirated<00:01:21.840> they're<00:01:22.200> stolen<00:01:22.619> those

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
they're pirated they're stolen those

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.780 
they're pirated they're stolen those
people<00:01:23.820> didn't<00:01:24.450> pay<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.290> game<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.070> all

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
people didn't pay for the game so all

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
people didn't pay for the game so all
these<00:01:27.299> pc<00:01:27.720> players<00:01:28.049> who<00:01:28.290> always<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.770> upset

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
these pc players who always get upset

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
these pc players who always get upset
because<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.150> focused<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
because you know they focused on the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
because you know they focused on the
console<00:01:31.259> version<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.799> they<00:01:32.040> flipped<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> over

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
console version or they flipped it over

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
console version or they flipped it over
and<00:01:33.299> didn't<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.689> much<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> pc<00:01:34.700> that's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and didn't do much for the pc that's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
and didn't do much for the pc that's
probably<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> big<00:01:36.479> reason<00:01:36.689> why<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.590> they

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
probably a big reason why because they

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880 
probably a big reason why because they
know<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.670> put<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.240> whole<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:40.020> money

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
know if they put in a whole lot of money

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
know if they put in a whole lot of money
and<00:01:41.130> investment<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:41.909> these<00:01:42.030> pc<00:01:42.420> games<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.899> lot

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and investment into these pc games a lot

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160 
and investment into these pc games a lot
of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.100> money<00:01:44.340> isn't<00:01:44.640> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.810> coming

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of the money isn't going to be coming

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.960 
of the money isn't going to be coming
back<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> be

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
back to them a lot of it's going to be

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350 
back to them a lot of it's going to be
stolen<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.990> 93<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> 95<00:01:50.250> percent<00:01:50.850> i<00:01:50.970> don't<00:01:51.210> know

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
played and how much are being paid for
so<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.290> thought<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.280> interesting

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
so I thought that was really interesting

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.770 
so I thought that was really interesting
to<00:02:08.910> note<00:02:09.119> he<00:02:10.110> goes<00:02:10.319> through<00:02:10.560> here<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> he<00:02:11.129> says

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
to note he goes through here and he says

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
to note he goes through here and he says
he<00:02:12.780> says<00:02:13.020> they

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
he says they

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860 
he says they
to<00:02:13.950> develop<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> PC<00:02:15.000> market<00:02:15.030> quite<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> lot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
to develop for the PC market quite a lot

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.500 
to develop for the PC market quite a lot
but<00:02:16.080> free-to-play<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:18.090> way<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.240> do

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
but free-to-play is really the way to do

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
but free-to-play is really the way to do
it<00:02:18.540> he<00:02:19.050> says<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> advantage<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.920> free-to-play

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
it he says the advantage to free-to-play

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.790 
it he says the advantage to free-to-play
is<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.900> get<00:02:22.080> revenue<00:02:22.560> from

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
is that we can get revenue from

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.740 
is that we can get revenue from
countries<00:02:23.340> where<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.850> couldn't<00:02:24.090> previously

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
countries where we couldn't previously

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.930 
countries where we couldn't previously
places<00:02:25.500> where<00:02:25.680> our<00:02:25.710> products<00:02:26.280> were<00:02:26.460> played

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
places where our products were played

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.080 
places where our products were played
but<00:02:27.330> not<00:02:27.570> ball<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.370> with

free-to-play<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.900> gain<00:02:31.110> revenue<00:02:31.350> which<00:02:32.130> helps

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
free-to-play we gain revenue which helps

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.550 
free-to-play we gain revenue which helps
make<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.870> brand<00:02:34.350> last<00:02:34.680> much<00:02:35.400> longer<00:02:36.320> he<00:02:37.320> says

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
content which sounds really low which is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.850 
content which sounds really low which is

like why would you do with them but he
says<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.370> basically<00:03:02.930> rounds<00:03:03.930> out<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
says it's basically rounds out to the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.000 
says it's basically rounds out to the
same<00:03:04.680> for<00:03:05.340> putting<00:03:06.210> out<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> pc<00:03:07.020> game<00:03:07.290> because

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
same for putting out a pc game because

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 
same for putting out a pc game because
he<00:03:08.160> says<00:03:08.340> 93<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.000> 95<00:03:09.270> percent<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.080> actually

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
he says 93 to 95 percent is actually

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.160 
he says 93 to 95 percent is actually
pirated<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:12.060> he<00:03:12.180> said<00:03:12.390> basically<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
pirated so he said basically it's the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.440 
pirated so he said basically it's the
same<00:03:13.260> percentage<00:03:13.950> but<00:03:14.580> he<00:03:14.850> said<00:03:15.030> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.240> long

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
same percentage but he said in the long

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.990 
same percentage but he said in the long
term<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.140> actually<00:03:16.620> tends<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.400> bring<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.790> more

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
term it actually tends to bring in more

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.090 
term it actually tends to bring in more
money<00:03:18.060> from<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:19.080> they've<00:03:19.290> seen<00:03:19.560> apparently

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
money from what they've seen apparently

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.300 
money from what they've seen apparently
with<00:03:20.490> free<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.940> play<00:03:21.350> also<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.680> benefits<00:03:23.130> to

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
with free to play also the benefits to

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.100 
with free to play also the benefits to
free-to-play<00:03:23.490> is<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.690> cheaper<00:03:25.080> to

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
free-to-play is that it's cheaper to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.110 
free-to-play is that it's cheaper to
produce<00:03:25.260> they<00:03:25.709> don't<00:03:25.920> have<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.280> make<00:03:26.850> new

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
produce they don't have to make new

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.730 
produce they don't have to make new
technology<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.870> know<00:03:27.990> a<00:03:28.020> lot<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.290> these<00:03:28.440> games

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
technology you know a lot of these games

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.040 
technology you know a lot of these games
are<00:03:28.980> using<00:03:29.640> technology<00:03:30.209> already<00:03:30.630> in<00:03:30.750> place

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
are using technology already in place

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.640 
are using technology already in place
and<00:03:32.040> they<00:03:32.340> also<00:03:32.550> get<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.390> avoid<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.990> cost<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
and they also get to avoid the cost of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.040 
and they also get to avoid the cost of
actually<00:03:35.120> boxing<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.360> product<00:03:36.810> and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
actually boxing up a product and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.930 
actually boxing up a product and
shipping<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.740> out<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.280> they're<00:03:38.430> saving<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.790> lot

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
shipping it out so they're saving a lot

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.470 
shipping it out so they're saving a lot
of<00:03:39.090> money<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:40.550> don't<00:03:41.550> know<00:03:41.790> that's<00:03:42.120> that's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
of money and I don't know that's that's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.100 
of money and I don't know that's that's
crazy<00:03:42.600> to<00:03:43.590> me<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.630> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
crazy to me to think that so much of the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.250 
crazy to me to think that so much of the
games<00:03:46.320> out<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.590> are<00:03:47.010> being<00:03:47.880> pirated<00:03:48.510> and

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
games out there are being pirated and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.170 
games out there are being pirated and
that's<00:03:49.650> where<00:03:49.980> console<00:03:50.580> kind<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.850> comes<00:03:51.030> in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
that's where console kind of comes in

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.480 
that's where console kind of comes in
because<00:03:51.300> it's<00:03:52.080> really<00:03:52.410> hard<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.980> pirate

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
because it's really hard to pirate

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.699 
because it's really hard to pirate
console<00:03:54.300> games<00:03:54.540> there's<00:03:54.840> not<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.140> big<00:03:55.500> market

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
because it's free so I thought that was

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.050 
because it's free so I thought that was
interesting<00:05:28.010> 93<00:05:29.010> to<00:05:29.100> 95<00:05:29.250> percent<00:05:29.880> of<00:05:29.970> the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
interesting 93 to 95 percent of the

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.890 
interesting 93 to 95 percent of the
games<00:05:30.300> stolen<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:31.919> our<00:05:32.280> PC<00:05:32.700> players<00:05:33.510> are<00:05:33.780> they

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.659 
games stolen so our PC players are they
shooting<00:05:34.230> themselves<00:05:34.380> in<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:35.010> foot<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.550> know
