 I greet you my dear today we 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.390
 continue to cook healthy and tasty 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000
 food in a double boiler 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.660
 this time we will have a fish from me 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.800
 pink salmon 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.469
 these two such good layers of fish 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.940
 pink salmon is a fish I'm a bit like that 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:35.739
 dryish we defrost it 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.260
 me unfortunately frozen and so 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.340
 decently i won't cook it all 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.420
 too much i will cut this one here 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.149
 I'll wait for him to defrost 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:53.430
 completely and will marinate and so fish 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:56.079
 we have melted and now we will 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.989
 marinade for marinade we need 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.840
 mayonnaise soy sauce and vegetable any 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.750

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.539
 seasoning any kind 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.280
 revered there on the back of that 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.090
 He likes to weed another way too 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.200
 great choice on the market so add 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.810
 here is soy sauce but this is probably somewhere 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.240
 Here on these here I get rather 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:37.979
 just half a kilo of fish so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.099
 tablespoon soy sauce added 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.049
 teaspoon of mayonnaise 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:56.619

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.030

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.620
 leave marinate our fish somewhere 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.799

 the next stage is very easy driving 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 before the birth of jerks while us 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.549
