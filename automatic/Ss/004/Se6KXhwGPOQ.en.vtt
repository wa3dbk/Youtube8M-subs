areas<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.250> skin<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.730> tend<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.239> apply<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.750> with

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
areas of skin I tend to apply that with

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.020 
areas of skin I tend to apply that with
either<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.549> flannel<00:02:21.090> or<00:02:21.269> I'll<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.939> something<00:02:23.939> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
either a flannel or I'll use something a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
bit more abrasive like this so I can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.530 
bit more abrasive like this so I can
work<00:02:25.829> into<00:02:26.250> particular<00:02:26.579> areas<00:02:26.609> which<00:02:27.299> have
