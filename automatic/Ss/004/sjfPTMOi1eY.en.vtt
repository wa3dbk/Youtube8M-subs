00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.329
 January 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.349
 I live in the Yamaha Music Europe 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 Excerpt from I would like to give you today the Yamaha lines technique 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.630
 imagine 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.010
 that we a goal is a soul good acoustic Gurria 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.370
 at a reasonable price and one of the best selling a stage piano 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.400
 the value 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.470
 There is no wider choice of pianos 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.750
 there around digital and used instruments 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.780
 but how are they? 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
 That the deal is the best alternative 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.980
 let me say so 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.370
 that's a great one kiss this piano 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.910
 with excellent Michalik 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.910
 and there would be years before beginners 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 that also includes picnic 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 that is so easy 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.600
 that they plug in the headphones 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.540
 and play a fantastic digital plan 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.620
 without disturbing the other or being directed from the inside 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.330
 great ode 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.150
 how it works 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.300
 the picture 1 is someone still purely acoustic criticism 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.970
 have a look 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.340
 Here you can see the page 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 the mechanic 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 and the pedals 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660
 50 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.450
 meet Hannover 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.800
 on the side 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 and create a 2 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 No, I activate the mute 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.710
 hinders a bar 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 that they hit the hammer potters on the side 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.470
 instead capture sensors 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.450
 they play 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.889
 and wander St in a digital signal Rome 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.729
 all pedals 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.039
 and hammer 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.189
 Simin sensors fitted 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.689
 who recognize every movement 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.429
 so that even the slightest nuance 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.429
 good grades like that is given 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.260
 the signals become 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 to create another sound built 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.309
 and she higher before playing the piano 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.479
 with the headphones 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.589
 with this little box they regulate the vocals 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.099
 in front of up to two headphones 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.119
 a really good piano sound 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.769
 and the feel of the game 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.109
 an acoustic perfect 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:51.680
 this mute 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.219
 There are many of ours we see 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 and Dan GB 1 lead 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.270
 lead for many more Yamaha 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.839
 there is a whole new one 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.309
 sophisticated system 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:08.929
 with many advantages 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.519
 For example, they become one of ten fantastic and sounds 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.399
 I'll show you this 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:19.790
 At home she could also connect her hifi system 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.679
 With this casting here Dettmann sounded different 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.909
 they even know how to record their games 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.239
 Bring just this button 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.629
 and then this one 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.029
 Haneke 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.740
 after the games they would be able to do that 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.849
 and then inflates 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.049
 they connect a computer 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.109
 take up there directly 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.439
 and save the stripping 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.129
 then on a good way 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.590
 or I choose her beautifully sounded variation 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.009
 everything looked like a wing but a special construction 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.930
 at an important part I do not 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.969
 is the natural for them 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.300
 in big Breese this feeling of touch 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.350
 could not agree on a real Yamaha Lemgo 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.439
 this sophisticated the tests go 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.020
 is also available for our pianos 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.529
 FB siren 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.689
 the four-door USA series 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.939
 and think Usingen 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.870
 the conservatories standard 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.780
 like this 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.460
 where once SG 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.480
 a year he has a lot with storm circuits offering the best of both 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.890
 it is a great piano 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.650
 with the battles sound of an Acton Tradition Siska Mainz 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.249
 to go with a modern CIS 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.270
 that's a style over direct view 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.249
 Yamaha 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.800
 because the first piano maker 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.240
 the service for so many models 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.469
 had in offer 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.469
 Visit a dam once 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:21.279
 in their vicinity
