00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and hello everyone welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.660
 what you didn't know at the castillon 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 things this new and what you didn't know 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.090
 we look at minecraft the so far 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 most requested what you didn't know about 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 normally at least to the intro 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.130
 and then we even look at five 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.390
 fun facts that you probably 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.390
 didn't know 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.400
 so we all know of course 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.730
 called the nether and how it ended up 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.860
 a little bit away from the whole 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.590
 how we actually see that 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.590
 well the nether is also called the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.110
 helmet it was also a first instance 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.400
 name for the nether hell 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 then it was quickly changed to 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.339
 the monkey is just that one too 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.339
 bit 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.309
 faith problems namely the Christians 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.739
 who say it did not like that 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.330
 for example, hell is called or the app is and 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.790
 therefore , ultimately 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.229
 noite but decided to nether 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.210
 just leave the letter 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.510
 because that's a very nice guess 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.159
 name but it 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.260
 yes remained original and if not the 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.850
 to attack Christians or whatever 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.409
 in their faith and the second 5 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.299
 we think that is probably the fact of mine 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.670
 all still know because one before 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.330
 minecraft considered the point a venture 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.909
 update 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.610
 was so that zombies still dropped feathers 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.910
 it was so that once there was one 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.100
 not yet become a zombie flash and be the place 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.700
 before that was a springy zombies that 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.580
 is really true from the alpha already four him 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.560
 while skeletons and whatever it 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.850
 coasts had meet items 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.980
 dropped the sun that is still again 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.210
 minecraft also do not always have 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.040
 eaten minecraft 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.840
 minecraft is actually called something first 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.710
 very different but this changed it later 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.150
 Mike first weighs game game 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 game if you look it up on youtube side 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.420
 also some foot to see something of that 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 was the very first version of minecraft 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.909
 the very first of all first version 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.310
 say nothing with nothing at all 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.000
 but stone and are there at the bottom of that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.610
 it was and with funny is that the name 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.170
 Markus Persson never found the creator of 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.400
 minecraft not really that convincing 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.049
 or great 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.020
 so what he did is he has it 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.820
 basically that and a minecraft 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.860
 that name clearly liked it very much 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.110
 and then I stayed that way and sound 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.330
 of the and there people actually one 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.910
 normal person hello 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.490
 he or what's up says and they have this 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.660
 then corey first in sony vegas van van 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.700
 audio in this door 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.760
 and have never added roorda to and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.380
 noise and therefore it sounds whole 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 different but if you make the return noises 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.300
 so back in cents again then would 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.670
 You can still hear something from the hello 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.810
 hi what's up so pretty funny 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.310
 to see how denim and sounds 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.230
 eventually made that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.120
 last fact you are about law standard 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.700
 wetzel is not always redstone 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.110
 been zipper thomas namely the the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.690
 precursor redstone 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.640
 where the gears are once the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 time in the beats removed 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.140
 the game because in the end it's nothing 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.970
 turned out to be and because it was just whole 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.890
 many of the run's include it 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.580
 just it was an animation that was constant 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.200
 move it it was just very bad 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.850
 inefficient for minecraft if we whole 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.520
 much in the world 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.100
 and therefore the item was deleted and 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.730
 was later added again as one 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.070
 ear 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.080
 called redstone though and the clear score 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.240
 you say but placed half an hour 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.760
 save so beautiful so only on the ground 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.110
 places and that is actually the big thing 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.150
 difference but for the rest they had 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.430
 exactly the same effect once 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.900
 are eventually deleted because it 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.270
 nothing works 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.130
 in case these were all five facts 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.780
 hopefully you didn't know this 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.490
 hopefully you now think of what the fuck it 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.580
 with i really totally not jordi you are 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.160
 against master hopefully that is true 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.810
 and if not then that is not and yes then it is possible 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.940
 I also do nothing more about it 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.680
 let 's just say standard outro 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.940
 and it is not the case here 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.590
 van is nice again than a green like 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.910
 Willem had won once and the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.160
 next time there will be last you were 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.810
 remained and for no he will pass 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.480
 this series way of next continue 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.040
 with new things we did not know late 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.690
 in the comments what you do not like 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.030
 knew you would like to see in the following 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.030
 week and she will always have a car until then
