00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090 
from the opener the total is high which
but<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:36.000> justified<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> course<00:01:36.810> 54<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.560> 55

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
but that's justified of course 54 or 55

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
but that's justified of course 54 or 55
and<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> half<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.180> Atlanta's<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and a half you know Atlanta's off a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
and a half you know Atlanta's off a
short<00:01:40.020> week<00:01:40.259> they<00:01:40.439> did<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> cover<00:01:41.100> at

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
short week they did get the cover at

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
short week they did get the cover at
Green<00:01:41.759> Bay<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.150> makes<00:01:42.360> two<00:01:42.570> straight<00:01:42.899> covers

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
Green Bay that makes two straight covers

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.600 
Green Bay that makes two straight covers
for<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.740> general<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.250> been<00:01:44.430> kind

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
for them but in general it's been kind

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.910 
for them but in general it's been kind
of<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.030> year<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.360> them<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.680> light<00:01:46.890> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of a down year for them so in light of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
of a down year for them so in light of
that<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.579> light<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.149> know<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.689> strong

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that and in light of you know how strong

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.450 
that and in light of you know how strong
pit<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.619> general<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.100> looking<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> mean

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
pit in general is looking I mean

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.710 
pit in general is looking I mean
obviously<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> defense<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.390> looking<00:01:51.450> very

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
obviously the defense is looking very

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.660 
obviously the defense is looking very
vulnerable<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.439> their<00:01:52.979> offense<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> looking

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
vulnerable but their offense is looking

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.710 
vulnerable but their offense is looking
like<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.119> make<00:01:54.149> up<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.450> whatever

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
like they can make up for whatever

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.510 
like they can make up for whatever
deficiencies<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> might<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:55.979> defense

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
deficiencies they might have on defense

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
deficiencies they might have on defense
maybe<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> shot<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:57.990> pit

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
maybe you want to take a shot with pit

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.020 
maybe you want to take a shot with pit
but<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.710> interesting<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> line<00:01:59.399> has

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
but it's interesting that the line has

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
but it's interesting that the line has
gotten<00:02:00.450> better<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.899> then<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> total<00:02:02.219> look

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gotten better and then the total look

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.069 
gotten better and then the total look
it's<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.700> high<00:02:02.850> total<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.930> both

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
it's a high total but you know both

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's a high total but you know both
these<00:02:04.229> teams<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.649> strong<00:02:04.979> over<00:02:05.340> trenders

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
these teams with strong over trenders

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.779 
these teams with strong over trenders
trip<00:02:06.119> pit<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> six<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.200> one<00:02:07.640> over/under<00:02:08.640> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
trip pit is a six and one over/under in

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.609 
trip pit is a six and one over/under in
their<00:02:09.179> last<00:02:09.450> seven<00:02:09.840> games<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.349> their<00:02:10.440> two

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
their last seven games and their two

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.170 
their last seven games and their two
games<00:02:10.830> since<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> bye<00:02:11.340> both<00:02:11.640> went<00:02:11.910> into<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
games since the bye both went into the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.430 
games since the bye both went into the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
three straight overs and of course the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
three straight overs and of course the
Green<00:02:15.060> Bay<00:02:15.240> game<00:02:15.450> went<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.810> 80<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.740> light<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
Green Bay game went to 80 so in light of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
Green Bay game went to 80 so in light of
all<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.370> maybe<00:02:17.670> 54<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.750> not<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.200> high<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
all that maybe 54 is not that high of a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.660 
all that maybe 54 is not that high of a
total<00:02:19.920> what's<00:02:20.070> your<00:02:20.160> take<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> game

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
total what's your take on this game

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.240 
total what's your take on this game
calendar<00:02:21.180> yeah<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.660> like<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> total<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.070> this

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
calendar yeah I like the total in this

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.410 
calendar yeah I like the total in this
one<00:02:23.490> okay<00:02:23.820> um

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
one okay um

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.570 
one okay um
side<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:26.070> bit<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.370> lean<00:02:26.550> I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
side just is a little bit of a lean I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.960 
side just is a little bit of a lean I
kind<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.270> Atlanta<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.260> um<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.100> think<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
kind of like Atlanta here um I think the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
kind of like Atlanta here um I think the
Pittsburgh<00:02:30.420> may<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.810> little<00:02:31.020> bit<00:02:31.200> overrated

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
Pittsburgh may be a little bit overrated

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.800 
Pittsburgh may be a little bit overrated
after<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.250> win<00:02:32.430> against<00:02:33.030> Cincinnati<00:02:33.270> last

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
after that win against Cincinnati last

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.210 
after that win against Cincinnati last
week<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.380> said<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> last<00:02:34.920> week's

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
week like I said in the last week's

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.730 
week like I said in the last week's
video<00:02:35.550> I'm<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.510> big<00:02:36.690> Cincinnati<00:02:37.170> Bengals<00:02:37.560> fan

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
video I'm a big Cincinnati Bengals fan

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.370 
video I'm a big Cincinnati Bengals fan
myself<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:38.910> Cincinnati's<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.840> little

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
myself but I think Cincinnati's a little

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.080 
myself but I think Cincinnati's a little
bit<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.650> paper<00:02:40.890> tiger<00:02:41.190> right<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.910> not

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
bit of a paper tiger right now I'm not

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
bit of a paper tiger right now I'm not
sure<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.420> they're<00:02:42.570> that<00:02:42.690> good<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.110> team<00:02:43.350> I

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
sure that they're that good of a team I

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.530 
sure that they're that good of a team I
think<00:02:44.340> that's<00:02:44.520> gonna<00:02:44.640> play<00:02:44.730> itself<00:02:45.240> out<00:02:45.480> over

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
think that's gonna play itself out over

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.450 
think that's gonna play itself out over
the<00:02:45.840> rest<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> season<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.830> hope<00:02:47.190> I'm<00:02:47.430> wrong

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the rest of the season I hope I'm wrong

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.600 
the rest of the season I hope I'm wrong
as<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> Bengals<00:02:48.450> fan<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.950> Steelers<00:02:50.400> are<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
as a Bengals fan but the Steelers are a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.240 
as a Bengals fan but the Steelers are a
team<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.150> me<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> really<00:02:53.100> good

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
team to me that have a really good

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.610 
team to me that have a really good
offense<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.390> defense<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:55.050> isn't<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.500> all

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
offense and a defense that isn't at all

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.040 
offense and a defense that isn't at all
what<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.890> has<00:02:56.190> been<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> past<00:02:56.820> people<00:02:57.810> who

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620 
few weeks probably know where I'm going
with<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.160> one<00:03:02.520> because<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.790> played<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.360> over

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
with this one because I played the over

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.350 
with this one because I played the over
three<00:03:03.960> times<00:03:04.230> what<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> Steelers<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:06.180> won

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
three times what the Steelers have won

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.270 
three times what the Steelers have won
all<00:03:06.540> three<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.930> them<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> video<00:03:07.410> I'm<00:03:08.070> gonna

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
all three of them in the video I'm gonna

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.910 
all three of them in the video I'm gonna
take<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.640> over<00:03:08.760> again<00:03:09.210> um<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.530> know<00:03:10.740> if

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
take the over again um I don't know if

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.350 
take the over again um I don't know if
they<00:03:11.040> could<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.340> set<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.550> line<00:03:11.850> high<00:03:12.120> enough

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
they could have set a line high enough

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.320 
they could have set a line high enough
for<00:03:12.600> me<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:13.020> take<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.470> over<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.120> think

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
for me to not take this over and I think

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.479 
for me to not take this over and I think
fifty<00:03:15.690> four<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> half<00:03:16.200> fifty<00:03:16.800> five<00:03:17.010> points

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
fifty four and a half fifty five points

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.150 
fifty four and a half fifty five points
is<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> very<00:03:18.120> fair<00:03:18.420> number<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.830> thought

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
is a very fair number really I thought

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.380 
is a very fair number really I thought
it<00:03:20.340> might<00:03:20.489> be<00:03:20.640> even<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.880> little<00:03:21.030> bit<00:03:21.209> higher

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
it might be even a little bit higher

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900 
it might be even a little bit higher
than<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.690> Julio<00:03:22.620> Jones<00:03:22.890> questionable<00:03:23.700> for

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
than that Julio Jones questionable for

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.550 
than that Julio Jones questionable for
this<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.300> that's<00:03:24.480> probably<00:03:24.870> why<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.110> total

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
this one that's probably why the total

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.920 
this one that's probably why the total
is<00:03:25.770> not<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.920> little<00:03:26.250> bit<00:03:26.370> higher<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.940> will<00:03:27.690> say

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
is not a little bit higher I will say

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.540 
is not a little bit higher I will say
the<00:03:28.080> Falcons<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.680> lot<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.010> weapons<00:03:29.190> even

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
the Falcons have a lot of weapons even

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.640 
the Falcons have a lot of weapons even
without<00:03:29.910> Julio<00:03:30.360> Jones<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.959> think<00:03:31.170> they<00:03:31.500> can

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
without Julio Jones I think they can

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.770 
without Julio Jones I think they can
move<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.980> ball<00:03:32.130> Matt<00:03:33.030> Ryan's<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.570> much

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
move the ball Matt Ryan's a much

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.420 
move the ball Matt Ryan's a much
different<00:03:34.230> quarterback<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.830> home<00:03:34.980> than<00:03:35.220> he<00:03:35.340> is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
different quarterback at home than he is

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.790 
different quarterback at home than he is
on<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.670> road<00:03:35.959> he<00:03:36.959> looked<00:03:37.200> really<00:03:37.350> good<00:03:37.470> at

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
on the road he looked really good at

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.410 
on the road he looked really good at
Green<00:03:38.040> Bay<00:03:38.070> but<00:03:38.280> usually<00:03:38.820> he<00:03:38.880> struggles<00:03:39.300> on

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
Green Bay but usually he struggles on

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.380 
Green Bay but usually he struggles on
the<00:03:39.450> road<00:03:39.690> he's<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.440> good<00:03:40.739> at<00:03:40.890> home<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.730> wanted

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
the road he's very good at home I wanted

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.670 
the road he's very good at home I wanted
to<00:03:42.480> give<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> few<00:03:42.900> stats<00:03:43.110> here<00:03:43.380> about<00:03:43.560> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to give a few stats here about the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.490

Steelers the Steelers only 24 sacks so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.710 
Steelers the Steelers only 24 sacks so
far<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.950> year<00:03:47.220> what<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.269> doing<00:03:48.450> is

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
far this year what that's doing is

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.210 
far this year what that's doing is
they're<00:03:48.870> putting<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.440> lot<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.620> pressure<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.100> a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
they're putting a lot of pressure on a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.009 
they're putting a lot of pressure on a
secondary<00:03:50.790> that's<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.390> good<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.750> start

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
secondary that's not that good to start

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.130 
secondary that's not that good to start
with<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.800> up<00:03:53.550> front<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.180> Steelers<00:03:54.600> have<00:03:54.989> been

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140

with so up front the Steelers have been
okay<00:03:55.500> against<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.950> run<00:03:56.130> but<00:03:56.459> against<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
okay against the run but against the

the<00:03:58.410> quarterback<00:03:58.709> and<00:03:59.310> that's<00:04:00.150> gonna<00:04:00.239> get

bleh which is second in the NFL I think

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.510 
bleh which is second in the NFL I think
there's<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.500> lot<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.830> reasons<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.190> like<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
there's a lot of reasons to like the

younger in this game all right and the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.870 
younger in this game all right and the
fact<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.770> might<00:04:32.920> be<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.130> little<00:04:33.520> bit<00:04:33.670> of<00:04:33.790> a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
fact that it might be a little bit of a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.780 
fact that it might be a little bit of a
kind<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.390> you<00:04:34.690> know<00:04:34.720> obvious<00:04:35.530> play<00:04:36.160> doesn't

kind of a you know obvious play doesn't

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.430 
kind of a you know obvious play doesn't
throw<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:36.970> off<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.600> like<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.020> said<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.320> only
