00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.110
 Welcome to the first application video 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.240
 and teaches you there in them, right? 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.860
 so each video comes back explaining a 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.900
 facing a turn and 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.349
 at the request of the crew and that the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:27.070
 but I see in this style that 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:31.449
 is the following is I will explain to have sina 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.160
 You are very fast to have sina is a set 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.320
 here in both the third and 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.739
 watching is in the group that there 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.949
 others are the sad fate against working 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:50.079
 it's three beats per time so it goes 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:52.180
 run out what will go down in aa pan hand 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.930
 There's going to be an hour right and another time at hand. 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:02.469
 left 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:05.500
 slow is good two axes 14 hours goes 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.720
 fall rights than right and left 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.380
 left and right 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.080
 left right and left turn 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.810
 watching will fall all by hand 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.630
 right because in two times we have 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 to have sina 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.340
 she will watch it will not heads two 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.160
 two times 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:37.810
 in a certain time then what we 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:43.330
 we would do with one of three of the 23 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:52.900
 so it 's not getting focused on you 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:55.810
 see the time so this is so make a 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:03.570
 Tersina compass you realize the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.570
 another pressing compass go to 23 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:21.880
 234 what is cool if you study to have 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.620
 this difference in the case of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.230
 that we will demonstrate one more better 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.570
 watch on that the way it's folded 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.970
 It's what he's going to have. He 'll have more. 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.940
 movement until it teaches will roll a 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.620
 star but for study effect is cool 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.410
 if you study medicine because it is the most 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 slow application gives you moms 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.020
 attended is also important before 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.180
 you get to legal speed if you study 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.560
 slowly also then what I will pass 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.850
 today will be the following we will use the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.730
 first time 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.870
 We'll put it until this Christmas, I'll go 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.850
 demonstrate the first time we have 12 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.459
 box box alternating time will stay 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:12.730
 with a first its time 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:16.450
 second time 2 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 standby right and left 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.910
 right and left time three deaf 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.769
 right in the box 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.370
 it's time 3 at the end of time 4 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.410
 turn left hand left turn 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 right and left without protecting year 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.830
 very careful to do it right 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.459
 wait 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.220
 So it's a new time, I'll wait for you. 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.180
 I'll say time 2 left and right loss 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.680
 I have three right waiting right and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:58.739
 time 4 right waiting right in order 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.739
 it 's 2 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.480
 who is continuous 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:38.930
 three're a little more speed or 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:40.370
 To listen to this with the group is what I 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.190
 I said I 'm strange because she gives a 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:53.690
 accelerated accuracy but is in the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:57.259
 is in the 13 347 deaths 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.860
 watching now we will put the 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:08.500
 you make a compass from Tersina 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:12.470
 it would be 3 in two times you will do 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:20.360
 teach a compass to have belt go 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:21.380
 stay 127 aedes aegypti time 34 equal 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.849
 huh 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.110
 would give two measures of teaching should 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.720
 compare sina 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.490
 so I'll have it then continue 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:42.520
 applying attend the same thing 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:46.099
 we will double'll be ok 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.970
 applying will keep regretting 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.970
 speed is 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:16.330
 and teach you would stay for the difference usa 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:42.560
 do once insists on the pool is 2667 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:45.620
 applying watch then remembering 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.670
 a very relaxed touch the hand nee and try 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:55.810
 do very high type box I think is 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:59.360
 Relaxed, I'll tell you now. 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:16.060
 group and with application watching let's 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:16.060
 there 1 2 3 4 3 3 without listening 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.270
 good that's it 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:25.240
 I hope you liked this score 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:27.910
 You'll find it on my channel on 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.220
 facebook on my page that 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.240
 videos update that the link is 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.720
 below 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.150
 put there she will have the score 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.740
 toxin and sine exactly the same 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.380
 application ok 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.830
 I hope you enjoyed it and see you next time. 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.250
 class 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.250
 thanks
