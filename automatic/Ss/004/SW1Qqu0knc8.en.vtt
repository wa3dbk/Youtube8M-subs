00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
it but the archer queen is gonna focus
on<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> wall<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> maybe<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.030> more

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
on that wall and maybe get some more

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
on that wall and maybe get some more
loot<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> Town<00:01:37.049> Hall<00:01:37.079> has<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> gone<00:01:37.740> down<00:01:37.799> yet

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
loot the Town Hall has it gone down yet

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
loot the Town Hall has it gone down yet
since<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.640> about<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:39.150> archers<00:01:39.630> left

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
since there are about two archers left

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
since there are about two archers left
you<00:01:40.350> should<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> brought<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you should have brought some more and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
you should have brought some more and
just<00:01:42.060> focused<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> town<00:01:42.990> hall<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just focused on that town hall so if it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
just focused on that town hall so if it
were<00:01:44.009> me<00:01:44.159> attacking<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:44.939> I'd<00:01:45.180> probably

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
were me attacking right now I'd probably

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
were me attacking right now I'd probably
hope<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> Archer<00:01:46.920> Queen<00:01:47.070> goes<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
hope that that Archer Queen goes to that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
hope that that Archer Queen goes to that
gold<00:01:47.909> mine<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.420> takes<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.680> that

gold mine and takes out some of that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.310 
gold mine and takes out some of that
gold<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.430> she<00:01:50.700> goes<00:01:50.880> 611<00:01:51.750> thousand

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

gold and five hundred eleven thousand

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
gold and five hundred eleven thousand
elixir<00:01:54.570> she's<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.680> elixir

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
elixir she's going to go in the elixir

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
elixir she's going to go in the elixir
cloak<00:01:56.549> ability<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> royal<00:01:57.420> oak<00:01:57.689> ability

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
cloak ability or the royal oak ability

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.170 
cloak ability or the royal oak ability
I'm<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:59.040> thinking<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.369> elixir<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.909> Royal

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I'm just thinking about elixir on Royal

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.789 
I'm just thinking about elixir on Royal
cloaks<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> guess

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
cloaks at the same time so I guess

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
cloaks at the same time so I guess
elixir<00:02:02.280> cloak<00:02:02.490> comes<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.149> thinking

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
elixir cloak comes out of that thinking

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.139 
elixir cloak comes out of that thinking

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's very very good with this raid and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.790 
that's very very good with this raid and
it<00:02:47.430> looks<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.730> he's<00:02:47.880> at<00:02:48.030> 1.7<00:02:48.900> million<00:02:49.230> loot

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.310 
it looks like he's at 1.7 million loot
and<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.250> can't<00:02:50.610> believe<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.360> guy<00:02:51.570> found<00:02:51.989> this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
and I can't believe this guy found this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.229 
and I can't believe this guy found this
much<00:02:52.620> loot<00:02:52.890> I've<00:02:53.070> never<00:02:53.280> found<00:02:53.670> anything

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
much loot I've never found anything

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.020 
much loot I've never found anything
above<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.810> think<00:02:55.040> 1.4<00:02:56.040> million<00:02:56.340> loot<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.910> my

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
above I think 1.4 million loot in my

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.570 
above I think 1.4 million loot in my
entire<00:02:57.480> life<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.410> maybe<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:58.950> comes<00:02:59.370> in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
entire life so maybe it just comes in

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.040 
entire life so maybe it just comes in
Champions<00:03:00.150> League<00:03:00.330> something<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
Champions League something like that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.390 
Champions League something like that
I've<00:03:01.170> been<00:03:01.290> searching<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.800> Champions<00:03:02.220> League
