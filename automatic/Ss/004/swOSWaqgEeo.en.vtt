00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.740 

it's<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.590> putting<00:01:01.590> together<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.430> Lego<00:01:03.300> set

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

it's like putting together a Lego set
without<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> how-to<00:01:05.010> instructions<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:08.119> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
without the how-to instructions and it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.679 
without the how-to instructions and it's
just<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.939> sportsmanship

just just you know that's sportsmanship
sort<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.350> thing<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:16.860> punch<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> prep

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.870 

gaskets<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> place<00:01:22.460> there's<00:01:23.460> bits

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
gaskets all over the place there's bits

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.800 
gaskets all over the place there's bits
and<00:01:24.509> bobs<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.729> look<00:01:27.119> smooth<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.700> just<00:01:29.810> yeah

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
okay so to figure out how to do this I

00:01:43.810 --> 00:02:09.800 
okay so to figure out how to do this I
gotta<00:01:44.200> take<00:01:44.680> apart<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:48.520> existing<00:01:50.189> fixture

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
