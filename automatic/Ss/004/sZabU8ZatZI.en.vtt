00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
like your robot was just trying to get

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.960 
like your robot was just trying to get
that<00:05:23.200> little<00:05:23.350> bit<00:05:23.590> of<00:05:23.680> extra<00:05:23.890> get<00:05:24.190> extra<00:05:24.790> gas

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
that little bit of extra get extra gas

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.640 
that little bit of extra get extra gas
but<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.510> time<00:05:25.660> for<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:25.930> bat<00:05:26.080> been<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.530> good

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
but if a time for the bat been that good

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.190 
but if a time for the bat been that good
silver<00:05:27.040> box<00:05:27.250> was<00:05:27.820> in<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.150> pit<00:05:28.390> I<00:05:28.600> think<00:05:28.990> that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
silver box was in the pit I think that

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.750 
silver box was in the pit I think that
sir<00:05:29.410> kilowatt<00:05:29.890> would<00:05:30.070> have<00:05:30.190> taken<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.610> die

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
sir kilowatt would have taken the die

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.890 
sir kilowatt would have taken the die
that's<00:05:31.420> right

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
that's right

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.630 
that's right
yeah<00:05:32.200> well<00:05:32.410> all<00:05:32.500> we<00:05:32.560> could<00:05:32.680> do<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:32.890> jab<00:05:33.250> so<00:05:33.520> we

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
yeah well all we could do is jab so we

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.470 
yeah well all we could do is jab so we
were<00:05:33.730> just<00:05:33.820> going<00:05:33.940> to<00:05:34.000> hit<00:05:34.090> them<00:05:34.210> as<00:05:34.270> hard<00:05:34.300> as

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
were just going to hit them as hard as

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.510 
were just going to hit them as hard as
we<00:05:34.570> could<00:05:34.750> straight<00:05:35.140> back<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.890> forth<00:05:36.070> motions

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
we could straight back and forth motions

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.390 
we could straight back and forth motions
