 Brazil is today the seventh power 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.080
 worldwide in the manufacture of automobiles 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.630
 produces more than 3.5 million vehicles 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 each year 75 percent of the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.790
 vehicles produced in South America 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.340
 produces in brazil it is a sector 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.980
 young in this market that has lived a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 special development in the last 20 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 years 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 an ideal breeding ground for cultivation 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.410
 automotive components companies 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 that have been installed there in the heat of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.329
 the multinational manufacturers of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 automobiles is the case of zannini a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 Spanish company specialized in 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 wheel trim brazil is the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.950
 largest country in South America with 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.920
 growth potential 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.540
 important is expected to produce 4 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.930
 million and a half vehicles in the year 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.550
 2016 surely turning into the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.550
 fifth or sixth world power 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.690
 ah 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280
 ah 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.850
 zannini is a very company 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.909
 internationalized present in all 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.310
 continents and with productive plants 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.740
 in addition to Brazil in countries like the USA 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.810
 Mexico and Czech Republic 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.060
 the Brazilian implantation was done in 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.090
 three phases we choose the city of 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.009
 curitiba because it was very close to the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.560
 Our country's plant per customer has 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.920
 come a person a little more directive 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.399
 understand the country how the part works 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.190
 legal fiscal of all this and choose the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.259
 proper form of installation a 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.960
 second stage has come a bit more than 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.929
 industry and the third stage has come 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.509
 then 13 for left already condition 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.369
 customer quality and accuracy of the 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.250
 homologation of the products together 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.380
 customers since 2003 more or 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.539
 less we do not have more expatriates we are 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.880
 an installation always be 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.729
 managed by people from brazil though 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 let's have the plant in brazil the model 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.350
 of sanÃ­n's business is a model that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.390
 part of the activities are 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.840
 concentrated in the parent company in in 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.840
 Spain 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.940
 that serve us are functions 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.819
 important strategic 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.470
 but that do not depend on an installation 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.780
 own in the country where they are 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.510
 initially the expectations are much 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.180
 greater than reality 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.329
 it was and 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.190
 there were some years in which although yes 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.950
 they were arriving 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.920
 the automakers 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 market never started as we expect in 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.870
 the beginning this trend changed and we have 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.830
 had to increase 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.830
 in our production 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 from its strategic plan in 2009 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.690
 got new contracts and have 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.950
 had to undertake important 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.950
 investments to modernize the process 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.849
 productive the key the financing 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.560
 initially we then finance 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.769
 all our expansion process 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.819
 international with its own resources 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.160
 and with the bank but currently given the 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.340
 financing difficulties that 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.230
 we find we have to go then to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.120
 the official aid and in this sense 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.519
 we are finding collaboration 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.160
 in this case from our investment that 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.290
 we just made in brazil as the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.360
 that we plan to do soon in the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.069
 republic of cooperation 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.049
 Once the neck of the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.930
 bottle that we had now our area 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.720
 of paint and we saw it necessary to do 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.700
 a new paint booth then to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.470
 through the financing already made by 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.180
 cofides we build we buy and 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.579
 we installed a new paint booth 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.190
 that we were not led to a new 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.440
 productive capacity to meet the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.340
 contracts 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.310
 followed in 2009 for this year and the year 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.710
 that comes the next 23 years and they improve 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.480
 quality at European levels remained 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.480
 the demands that customers asked us 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.790
 Brazil is undoubtedly a country full of 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.670
 opportunities for companies 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.370
 Spanish companies linked to both the 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.980
 automotive as to other sectors due 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.350
 to its dynamic and dynamic economy although 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.350
 in return you have to overcome the barriers 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.290
 and the language theme there is a cultural theme 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.420
 important there is a very important fiscal issue 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.240
 Brazil complex is a country still very 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.740
 complex from the fiscal point of view 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.120
 then there are no differences there are ways 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.340
 global doing things 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.500
 as much as possible the companies 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.669
 they try to implement global methodologies 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:09.180
 but there is a pretty cultural percentage 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.669
 significant opportunities there is the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.110
 market is huge the north market 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.750
 it is very different from the market of its 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.850
 we are a very large country a market with 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.550
 post of 198 million people not 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.550
 you can leave without at least devaluing
