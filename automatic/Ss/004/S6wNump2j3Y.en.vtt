00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.880 

now<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> straighten<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:01.620> bumper

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
now we're going to straighten the bumper

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.579 
now we're going to straighten the bumper
will<00:00:02.040> start<00:00:02.370> by<00:00:02.550> smashing<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.510> down<00:00:03.750> then

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
will start by smashing this down then

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.810 
will start by smashing this down then
we'll<00:00:04.799> flip<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.670> over<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:07.040> hit<00:00:08.040> along<00:00:08.400> here

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
we'll flip it over and hit along here

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.999 
we'll flip it over and hit along here
and<00:00:08.970> flatten<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.480> down<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:11.150> if<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.420> hammer

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009 
and flatten that down and if this hammer

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.770 
and flatten that down and if this hammer
not<00:00:14.009> big<00:00:14.190> enough<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> half

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
not big enough this is a two and a half

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.990 
not big enough this is a two and a half
pound<00:00:17.150> then<00:00:18.710> this<00:00:19.710> one<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.460> probably<00:00:20.609> worry

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pound then this one will probably worry

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.689 
pound then this one will probably worry
this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> sledge<00:00:21.720> hammer<00:00:22.250> with<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> handle

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
this is a sledge hammer with the handle

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.439 
this is a sledge hammer with the handle
cut<00:00:23.970> handle<00:00:24.689> broke<00:00:24.840> off<00:00:25.050> cut<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.420> made<00:00:27.420> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
cut handle broke off cut it off made a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.139 
cut handle broke off cut it off made a
very<00:00:27.990> short<00:00:28.560> handle<00:00:29.359> sledge<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> we'll<00:00:34.469> take<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
very short handle sledge so we'll take a

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.280 
very short handle sledge so we'll take a
wood<00:00:36.149> block<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.100> hit<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.250> about<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.290> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
wood block and hit it about like that to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:03:29.210 
wood block and hit it about like that to
knock<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.680> down

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:04:36.129 

we<00:03:30.220> need<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.550> straighten<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.240> other<00:03:31.360> way

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:37.719 

really<00:04:36.770> needs<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:36.979> be<00:04:37.069> flipped<00:04:37.370> over<00:04:37.550> the

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
really needs to be flipped over the

00:04:37.729 --> 00:05:26.069 
really needs to be flipped over the
other<00:04:37.909> way

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:26.079 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:29.979 

strain<00:05:27.079> this<00:05:27.259> out<00:05:27.499> here<00:05:28.659> just<00:05:29.659> going<00:05:29.809> to<00:05:29.899> get

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:29.989 
strain this out here just going to get

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:43.090 
strain this out here just going to get
this<00:05:30.139> kink<00:05:30.469> out

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.690 

see<00:05:43.700> if<00:05:43.790> a<00:05:43.850> hand<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:46.270> can<00:05:47.270> give<00:05:47.450> it<00:05:48.670> position

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
see if a hand I can give it position

00:05:49.700 --> 00:06:02.290 
see if a hand I can give it position
perfect<00:05:56.710> here<00:05:58.150> it's<00:05:59.150> about<00:05:59.240> over<00:05:59.660> here<00:06:01.300> like

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
perfect here it's about over here like

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.650 
perfect here it's about over here like
that<00:06:02.570> bow<00:06:02.810> hole<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.500> that<00:06:03.650> bolt<00:06:03.920> hole<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:05.510> then

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
that bow hole to that bolt hole and then

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.550 
that bow hole to that bolt hole and then
put<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.930> 2x4<00:06:06.170> on<00:06:06.560> top<00:06:06.890> hit<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:08.260> along<00:06:09.260> here<00:06:09.500> in

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
put a 2x4 on top hit it along here in

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.760 
put a 2x4 on top hit it along here in
the<00:06:09.650> crease<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:10.160> drop<00:06:10.370> it<00:06:10.490> down<00:06:10.640> but<00:06:14.680> makes<00:06:15.680> it

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
the crease to drop it down but makes it

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.290 
the crease to drop it down but makes it
difficult<00:06:16.010> because<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:16.670> can't<00:06:16.880> really<00:06:17.090> stand

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
difficult because you can't really stand

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.710 
difficult because you can't really stand
it<00:06:17.480> up<00:06:17.600> like<00:06:17.810> that

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
it up like that

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.540 
it up like that
so<00:06:20.720> put<00:06:20.900> the<00:06:20.990> trailer<00:06:21.200> hitch<00:06:21.440> in<00:06:21.740> we're

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
so put the trailer hitch in we're

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.340 
so put the trailer hitch in we're
impossible<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:23.180> get<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.510> so<00:06:23.720> I<00:06:23.750> loosen<00:06:24.230> this

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
impossible to get to so I loosen this

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.410 
impossible to get to so I loosen this
filler<00:06:24.650> panel<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.250> slid<00:06:25.550> it<00:06:25.640> back<00:06:25.670> can't<00:06:26.270> get

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
filler panel and slid it back can't get

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.320 
filler panel and slid it back can't get
it<00:06:26.510> out<00:06:26.890> with<00:06:27.890> the<00:06:28.010> bumper<00:06:28.280> on<00:06:28.460> that<00:06:28.730> slip<00:06:29.240> it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
it out with the bumper on that slip it

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.250 
it out with the bumper on that slip it
back<00:06:29.540> and<00:06:30.940> put<00:06:31.940> short<00:06:32.540> extension<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.200> a

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
back and put short extension and a

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.590 
back and put short extension and a
wiggle<00:06:33.590> joint<00:06:34.180> on<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.390> ratchet<00:06:35.570> and<00:06:37.600> it's

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
wiggle joint on the ratchet and it's

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.730 
wiggle joint on the ratchet and it's
working<00:06:38.930> slowly<00:06:39.800> but<00:06:40.700> it<00:06:40.970> is<00:06:41.180> working<00:06:41.500> you<00:06:42.500> can

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
working slowly but it is working you can

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:49.430 
working slowly but it is working you can
get<00:06:42.860> a<00:06:42.890> view<00:06:43.550> from<00:06:44.260> bottom

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.950 

so<00:06:50.010> we<00:06:50.130> get<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:50.340> top<00:06:50.490> ones<00:06:50.790> tightened<00:06:51.210> up<00:06:51.330> with

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
so we get the top ones tightened up with

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.110 
so we get the top ones tightened up with
the<00:06:52.050> filler<00:06:52.230> panel<00:06:52.590> back<00:06:52.740> in<00:06:52.980> bottom<00:06:53.940> ones

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
the filler panel back in bottom ones

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.080 
the filler panel back in bottom ones
aren't<00:06:54.750> too<00:06:55.170> difficult<00:06:55.590> to<00:06:55.680> get<00:06:55.800> to

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
aren't too difficult to get to

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.990 
aren't too difficult to get to
but<00:06:57.090> wiggle<00:06:57.870> joint<00:06:58.140> and<00:06:58.580> longer<00:06:59.580> extension

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
but wiggle joint and longer extension

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.210 
but wiggle joint and longer extension
and<00:07:00.300> should<00:07:00.420> be<00:07:00.510> able<00:07:00.570> to<00:07:00.720> get<00:07:00.840> them<00:07:04.220> trailer

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
and should be able to get them trailer

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.440 
and should be able to get them trailer
hitch<00:07:05.370> is<00:07:05.550> installed

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
hitch is installed

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.480 
hitch is installed
bumpers<00:07:07.200> back<00:07:07.380> on<00:07:07.710> and<00:07:09.110> man<00:07:10.160> that<00:07:11.160> thing<00:07:11.460> is

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
bumpers back on and man that thing is

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.750 
bumpers back on and man that thing is
low<00:07:12.710> it's<00:07:13.710> open<00:07:13.950> since<00:07:14.160> it<00:07:14.310> was<00:07:14.400> a<00:07:14.430> hidden

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 
low it's open since it was a hidden

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.900 
low it's open since it was a hidden
hitch<00:07:14.940> normally<00:07:15.450> on<00:07:16.290> a<00:07:16.350> hidden<00:07:17.100> hitch<00:07:17.280> this

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910 
hitch normally on a hidden hitch this

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.810 
hitch normally on a hidden hitch this
part<00:07:18.270> is<00:07:18.810> up<00:07:18.960> under<00:07:19.200> the<00:07:19.290> bumper<00:07:19.640> but<00:07:20.640> there's

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
part is up under the bumper but there's

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.390 
part is up under the bumper but there's
just<00:07:20.910> no<00:07:21.120> room<00:07:21.390> on<00:07:21.630> here<00:07:21.960> but<00:07:23.960> how<00:07:25.250> I'm<00:07:26.250> gonna

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
just no room on here but how I'm gonna

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.790 
just no room on here but how I'm gonna
drag<00:07:26.790> this<00:07:26.970> thing<00:07:27.210> on<00:07:27.330> a<00:07:27.360> lot<00:07:27.540> of<00:07:27.570> stuff

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
drag this thing on a lot of stuff

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.880 
drag this thing on a lot of stuff
off-roading

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:30.890 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.010 

but<00:07:31.890> I<00:07:31.920> guess<00:07:32.130> it's<00:07:32.370> it's<00:07:33.090> about<00:07:33.360> same<00:07:33.690> level

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
but I guess it's it's about same level

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.100 
but I guess it's it's about same level
as<00:07:34.110> a<00:07:34.140> gas<00:07:34.380> tank<00:07:34.800> so<00:07:35.600> I<00:07:36.600> guess<00:07:36.780> it's<00:07:36.960> better

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
as a gas tank so I guess it's better

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.570
