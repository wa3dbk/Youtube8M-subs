00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.960
 When you need to teach them world history, 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:21.119
 That's because society is changing. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 With the rapid development of means of transportation and means of communication, 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.920
 It's getting very close to being released. 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.820
 Ago, now we want to take out the road is going to be easy for foreign Meet 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.230
 I did not. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.550
 Now it's very easy to meet foreigners. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 Odin will become a member of the National Assembly this time in the general election of my society. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 I was there. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.610
 That three are getting very close. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.219
 In a society so close to us, 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.350
 It's a lot of difficulty. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.920
 In this global, unemployed society, now with understanding of our country 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:04.619
 I mean, we have to work together on three things. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.770
 And in order to make them understand the culture of the world of people and the environment 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.110
 I eat there and I'm with you. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 You have to see it. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 Dobby who you're talking about so 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 Germans are known not only outside the high-Section I Section I face a three-national 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 We also want dogs to put the country in 3 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 I'm going to the same national anthem Section 3 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:41.220
 One lesson away I been in this configuration, the lyrics are great praise for war 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 It is illegal to state verses 1 and 2 in national anthems. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.740
 There is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:51.660
 This is funny. In the case of our country, children go to elementary school 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 The national anthem can crawl up to section 1.4 and call the fire a lot 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:59.910
 There is a crush on you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.940
 In the same way, such cases can sing patriotic than the people who do not know very many 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.130
 It is said that there is very little 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:15.630
 The reason is that Germany is a nation that has waged a great war of world affection. 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:16.350
 Yes, because it is responsible for the activities patriotism for most people 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.680
 I will 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:25.950
 In this way, the thoughts of the lives of the people of each country , 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.630
 That would be a great meal reflect 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 Here, in the same way, 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:37.019
 I did. 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 It emphasizes understanding and respect for traditional culture and multiculturalism. 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.130
 Pray that children will be able to share unexpected and global cultures from kindergarten. 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.220
 I'm doing it. 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.080
 This flow reflects the cream that's been investigated. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:58.410
 Third grade 5. Give your body at the same time learning from our failures 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:00.990
 We learn three guarantees as well as three attempts at learning when we are offended 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.280
 Try to learn and meal 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.010
 From the third grade of elementary school, let 's 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.610
 The curriculum has changed. 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:17.250
 Elementary school days Do you study world history now? 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.050
 The children are in the third period 4 The first time they meet 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:26.670
 When 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:30.000
 Give it to middle school students in the past when calculating the fortress and politics as if supporting social textbooks 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.540
 But this time I had in learning 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.540
 I emphasize history very much and emphasize the weakness of the world with us . 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.310
 World history came from social textbooks. 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:49.560
 And a new textbook was created by combining world history and domestic science . 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:53.250
 In the textbook of history, children learn world history together 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.120
 We'll be studying for a whopping two years. 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.489
 The children did not meet at elementary school. 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.700
 To come up with such calculation that the ninth root portion dwaetneunde suddenly met 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.430
 I mean, it's very high . 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.580
 What do you want me to do? 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.090
 Ahpaya cases I was the target of gold 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:19.890
 World History Why is difficult once haebwatseupnida survey 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.750
 It was because I was unfamiliar. 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.450
 How to save 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.070
 I'm promoting it because I memorize it. 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.210
 The first thing you need to do is to help children become familiar with world history. 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.210
 It's very important .
