00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.639
 the past week you have also been able to meet us, we have Tuesday 13 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.809
 April in the final 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.640
 his songs number of bottles and I say started 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 the only one that did not steal here was an international top model within that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
 double and here jacket 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.300
 I am I am I am arfa and 16th started of course state I did 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.740
 end up 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 according to won 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.100
 and then the ball started rolling I have 15 senators against Amsterdam 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 moved 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.700
 it's a habit 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.910
 the attack and cda has after three years 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.040
 but what is true in London 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.989
 and if you then 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 swz is the food I hear later I landed fly tomorrow pass there 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080
 we now had all models 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.530
 and due to bad self immediately go to court it's one 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.360
 awkward 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.210
 we had i would say 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.890
 what is this 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.710
 but that just disappeared 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.510
 so go a helmet 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.610
 de france alstom what is this about time 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 where do we get impulsively 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 contact the faq for this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 you really have to go from one day to the next, I'm even crying behind 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 but there in Paris that is part of it 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 7 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.760
 but my contribution to the program 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.170
 and the opportunity to give and call for it does not matter and look at life 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.400
 van der meij gives 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.160
 a lot of good work and there was at that time Dutch girls are very bad 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.479
 loved by the fans 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.479
 are professional they always want to go far 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.410
 Perhaps an attack has a lot of quality year after year the burdens rise 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.970
 Known colleagues call the camera and can be the telegraph 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 but I can agree that writes the telegraaf 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.379
 next
