00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.620 

I<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.310> reading<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.580> magazine<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:42.120> this<00:01:42.450> one

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I was reading a magazine about this one

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.880 
I was reading a magazine about this one
day<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:42.990> remember<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.380> magazine<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
day I don't remember what magazine it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
day I don't remember what magazine it
was<00:01:44.010> but<00:01:44.370> Oprah<00:01:45.060> Winfrey<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.780> does<00:01:45.930> this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
was but Oprah Winfrey actually does this

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.050 
was but Oprah Winfrey actually does this
and<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.710> thought<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.190> kind<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.430> cool

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.280 

sometimes<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> watch<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.780> shows<00:01:52.020> she

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
sometimes if you watch your shows she

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.290 
sometimes if you watch your shows she
has<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> done<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.130> than<00:01:53.280> other<00:01:53.550> times<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.240> you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
has it done more than other times so you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.990 
has it done more than other times so you
can<00:01:54.510> tell<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.160> so<00:01:56.280> subtle<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.760> soft

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
can tell but it's so subtle and soft

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.280 
can tell but it's so subtle and soft
that<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.810> big<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that it's really not that big of a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.210 
that it's really not that big of a
difference<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:04.620> if<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.800> do<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> little

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
difference so if you do get a little

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.670 
difference so if you do get a little
down<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.610> center<00:02:05.970> like<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.300> did<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.530> just

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
down the center like I did you can just

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080 
down the center like I did you can just
take<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:07.890> foundation<00:02:08.460> and<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:08.880> right<00:02:09.060> over

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
take your foundation and go right over

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.300 
take your foundation and go right over
top<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.690> again<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.010> want<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.190> make

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
top of that again you just want to make

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.330 
top of that again you just want to make
sure<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.670> leave<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.120> part<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.800> real<00:02:17.040> color

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
sure you leave that part the real color

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.510

center of the nose that way like i said

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.979 
center of the nose that way like i said
this<00:03:08.579> is<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.790> brightest<00:03:09.180> part<00:03:09.389> and<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:09.810> side

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
this is the brightest part and this side

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.539 
this is the brightest part and this side
is<00:03:10.019> more<00:03:10.409> slim<00:03:12.200> if<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.889> want<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.159> can<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.430> your

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
is more slim if you want you can do your

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.009 
is more slim if you want you can do your
cheekbones<00:03:15.030> too<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.659> just<00:03:15.719> not<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
cheekbones too so that's just not the

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.520 
cheekbones too so that's just not the
only<00:03:16.139> thing<00:03:16.500> highlighted<00:03:21.319> that's<00:03:22.319> really

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
only thing highlighted that's really

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.020 
only thing highlighted that's really
going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> make<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.859> huge<00:03:23.159> difference<00:03:23.579> just

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
going to make a huge difference just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.429 
going to make a huge difference just
that<00:03:24.180> little<00:03:24.389> bit<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.629> color<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:24.959> we<00:03:25.260> did

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
that little bit of color that we did

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.039 
that little bit of color that we did
just<00:03:25.650> down<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.730> sides<00:03:26.969> it<00:03:27.329> really<00:03:27.540> brings<00:03:27.780> in

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
just down the sides it really brings in

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.259 
just down the sides it really brings in
and<00:03:28.409> kind<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.680> squeeze<00:03:28.949> the<00:03:29.280> tip<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.180> makes

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and kind of squeeze the tip so it makes

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.360 
and kind of squeeze the tip so it makes
it<00:03:30.389> appear<00:03:30.719> much<00:03:31.109> smaller<00:03:31.469> I<00:03:31.739> hope<00:03:32.189> that<00:03:32.310> helps

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
it appear much smaller I hope that helps

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860 
it appear much smaller I hope that helps
you<00:03:32.699> and<00:03:33.030> if<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.389> have<00:03:33.510> any<00:03:33.659> other<00:03:33.719> questions
