00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
I like the jumping on the firing lever

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
I like the jumping on the firing lever
right<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.369> lets<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.450> finger

price range you can't beat in their

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.550 
price range you can't beat in their
front<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.540> mean<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:02.310> screen<00:02:02.759> oh<00:02:03.560> they're
