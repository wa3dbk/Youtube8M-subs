00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.129
 My name is Alejandro Donatti, I am the 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:19.539
 axis architect we started in 2006 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.430
 this make a whole sequence of this 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.860
 line of buildings axis that we make 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.330
 through groups of investors 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.630
 today we are on axis 9 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.080
 it's a building that has about 3500 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.930
 approximately square meters are 32 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.930
 apartments are 8 floors of housing 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.000
 So what we are looking for is that the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 department be a department with 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 a lot of quality with a good 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.000
 habitability 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.950
 and this building is planned 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.590
 more than 3000 meters from these plates 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.860
 I searched dry and good apart all the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.620
 theme of durlock walls and ceilings 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.160
 good the whole durlock theme 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
 structural let's say 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 ng 12 came the first statement of 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.470
 start using hard in 3 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.690
 already the first is partition walls was 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.659
 a commercial building that's why out there 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.380
 we made the first step and we did 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.689
 the internal divisions all in hard to 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.109
 from there I think it was when 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.539
 we started to take courage and think that 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:49.729
 we could overcome the cultural issue that 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.340
 I think it was our limit as 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.439
 to transmit 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.899
 and how to make accept that the oil 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.530
 understand that the hard one was a material 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.530
 noble 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.800
 and I think that's what it does not have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.649
 credit because they used it badly 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.600
 fundamentally with bad terminations 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.840
 then like any bad wall 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.160
 finished starting on axis 4 we started 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 and we started seriously 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.810
 and we kept this idea of â€‹â€‹separating the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.060
 departments with brick and plaster that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.280
 today what we were doing with the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 revoke and we replaced it by the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 dry plaster 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:48.200
 the advantages are several the work of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.510
 block is concentrated in one place while 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.099
 that a traditional plaster generated 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.099
 movement throughout the building 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.590
 and this relieves a lot in the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.140
 internal organization of the work and good 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.500
 and on the other hand are the times 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.380
 specific ones that are much more agile than 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.050
 a traditional plaster because also what 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.600
 that we have been living is that these 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.380
 spaces 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.100
 closed with thighs generate an environment 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.280
 different from a space with plaster 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.430
 traditional because it is perceived from another 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.670
 way the temperature and sound are not 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.760
 feel surfaces as a point 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.520
 cold give a feeling of a more space 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.280
 dry on the other hand in terms of 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.610
 loudness are given as a situation 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.610
 nice 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.070
 somehow it's kinder 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.070
 Department
