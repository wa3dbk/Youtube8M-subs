00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.750
 books because last time I did 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.519
 quite crap but I finally did 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.250

 guys and reported to riders that 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.880
 maybe it was time to do the tutorial 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.100
 if so today we are more boys 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.240
 worker areas 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 let's think about the orange is not good 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 God surprised they suffered in goal is not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:42.870
 immediately went into the crossbar reiterates 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:45.059
 reiterate wait for 712 of bing here to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.649
 What I chose to go down we go 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 playing well, be careful 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 disadvantage what due to the initial 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.430
 because we say yes yes and lakes start 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.360
 guys look here right away with the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.360
 offshoot is abnormal is much easier 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.420
 boys towards double dancing ever 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.250
 seen in history from the stake but still 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.340
 dance but the important thing is that there is ryden 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.670
 to reiterate as good as it was all one 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.770
 tactic why we do this now 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.659
 flaws you impenneranno a nuisance of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.780
 madonna, however, we manage to get there 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.960
 beware of the ball like it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.490

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.700

 defender having the national team 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.490
 Japanese soccer is nothing to do 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.500
 the idea was not passionate and apple up 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 but little did I destroy mine 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.820

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.240
 the touch of rightness you made me 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.760
 touch of rightness right for play from 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.070
 just my ball and job management has 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.020
 minus the pitches you deliver dead to 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.790

 to the face of guys when you fuck them 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.120
 they bounce so in front of 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.880
 scissor kick manages to distance you from the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.880

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.380
 don't risk it if you don't need it 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.380
