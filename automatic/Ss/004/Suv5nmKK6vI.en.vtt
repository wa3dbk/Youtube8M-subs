1<00:00:13.139> gigahertz<00:00:13.969> processor<00:00:15.170> I'm<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.289> sure<00:00:16.410> we

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
1 gigahertz processor I'm not sure we

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
1 gigahertz processor I'm not sure we
I'm<00:00:17.130> sure<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.550> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> GPU<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.630> but

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I'm sure what kind of GPU it is but

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.099 
I'm sure what kind of GPU it is but
maybe<00:00:19.230> they've<00:00:19.529> done<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> 200-year<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.109> can't

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
maybe they've done a 200-year I can't

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.429 
maybe they've done a 200-year I can't
really<00:00:22.529> tell<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.670> sure<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.240> mean<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:25.289> no

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
really tell for sure I mean I have no

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.040 
really tell for sure I mean I have no
idea

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.420 

so<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> Sierra<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.740> could<00:00:31.949> either<00:00:32.040> run<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so the Sierra they could either run the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:01:14.830 
so the Sierra they could either run the
game

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.870 

can't<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:17.190> first<00:01:17.310> thing<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.760> see

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
can't see here the first thing I can see

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
can't see here the first thing I can see
is<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> graphics<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> definitely<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
is that the graphics is definitely the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.550 
is that the graphics is definitely the
word<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> would<00:01:20.520> play<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.910> on<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.560> more

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
word and if I would play this on a more

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.580 
word and if I would play this on a more
like<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.830> high-end<00:01:23.400> device<00:01:26.900> well<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.260> it's<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
like a high-end device well and it's a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.430 
like a high-end device well and it's a
little<00:01:28.800> bit<00:01:28.890> hard<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.220> steer<00:01:29.580> here<00:01:30.050> because<00:01:31.050> it

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
little bit hard to steer here because it

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:49.760 
little bit hard to steer here because it
reacts<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.190> slow<00:01:32.430> sometimes

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.539 

oh<00:01:49.799> yes<00:01:50.729> he's<00:01:51.720> nice<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.220> I<00:01:56.250> mean

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
oh yes he's nice and then you see I mean

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.280 
oh yes he's nice and then you see I mean
it<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:56.909> hard<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.509> sometimes<00:01:58.020> its

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it could be hard because sometimes its

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
it could be hard because sometimes its
limits<00:01:58.649> no<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> reacting<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.759> trying

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
limits no it's reacting that I'm trying

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:20.340 
limits no it's reacting that I'm trying
to<00:02:00.330> steer<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:10.700> whoa

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.510 

well<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.440> course<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.130> use<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
well of course I like to use the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.700 
well of course I like to use the
standard<00:02:22.700> wheel<00:02:22.940> maybe<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.630> like<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.440> use

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
standard wheel maybe you do like to use

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.820 
standard wheel maybe you do like to use
something<00:02:24.950> else<00:02:26.170> then<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.290> course<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.680> might

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
something else then of course it might

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.390 
something else then of course it might
be<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.070> different<00:02:28.280> experience<00:02:28.730> if<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.570> have

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
be a different experience if you do have

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
disease it's not that bad actually

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.230 
disease it's not that bad actually
