of<00:01:01.680> gear<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> best<00:01:02.550> one<00:01:02.820> out<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.180> now

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
of gear it's the best one out right now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.289 
of gear it's the best one out right now
on<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.600> tablet<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on a tablet so it's it going to be that

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
on a tablet so it's it going to be that
a<00:01:06.330> big<00:01:06.570> difference<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.650> are<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.130> your

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
a big difference when you are in your

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.530 
a big difference when you are in your
browser<00:01:08.869> well<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.260> depends<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.939> I'm<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
browser well that depends so if I'm not

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
browser well that depends so if I'm not
sure<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.470> right<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:13.830> but

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
sure if you can see it's right now but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
sure if you can see it's right now but
I'm<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.509> ahead<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> turn<00:01:16.170> down

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
I'm just going to go ahead and turn down

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.190 
I'm just going to go ahead and turn down
the<00:01:17.280> lights<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:19.080> just

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the lights a little bit and I'm just

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.320 
the lights a little bit and I'm just
going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.409> ahead<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.880> little<00:01:21.119> bit

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to go ahead and go a little bit

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
going to go ahead and go a little bit
closer<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.729> we<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.960> same<00:01:25.439> page

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
closer so we are here on the same page

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.780 
closer so we are here on the same page
basically<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:28.100> when<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.369> soon<00:01:29.610> doll

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
basically and when we are soon doll

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060 
basically and when we are soon doll
right<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.360> both<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:31.170> can't<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
right now on both we can't see a little

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.149 
right now on both we can't see a little
bit<00:01:32.189> more<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.810> rhs<00:01:33.810> transform<00:01:34.229> prime<00:01:34.470> because

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
bit more on rhs transform prime because

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.960 
bit more on rhs transform prime because
it<00:01:35.430> doesn't<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:37.040> Safari<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it doesn't have this Safari thing that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
it doesn't have this Safari thing that
you<00:01:39.060> can't<00:01:39.329> hide<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:41.600> from<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.840> am<00:01:43.170> at

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you can't hide but from where I am at

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.210 
you can't hide but from where I am at
the<00:01:43.590> moment<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.720> camera

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
the moment a little bit about the camera

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
the moment a little bit about the camera
it's<00:01:47.220> very<00:01:47.909> hard<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.810> read<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> text

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it's very hard actually to read the text

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
it's very hard actually to read the text
on<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> transformer<00:01:50.850> prime<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.020> are

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
on the transformer prime when we are

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
on the transformer prime when we are
soon<00:01:52.380> doubt<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
soon doubt like this and i know we see a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
soon doubt like this and i know we see a
little<00:01:54.240> bit<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.350> dress<00:01:55.500> form<00:01:55.530> prime

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
little bit more on the dress form prime

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
little bit more on the dress form prime
but<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.420> ahead<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> same

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but if we just go ahead and do the same

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.810 
but if we just go ahead and do the same
thing<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:59.960> give<00:02:00.960> out<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.500> little<00:02:01.710> bit<00:02:01.860> more<00:02:02.159> we

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
thing here give out a little bit more we

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.770 
thing here give out a little bit more we
can<00:02:03.090> still<00:02:03.450> see<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.799> text<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:06.509> much

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
can still see that the text is so much

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380 
can still see that the text is so much
more<00:02:06.810> clear<00:02:07.350> on<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:08.369> by<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.030> i

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
more clear on that by that because i

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.510 
more clear on that by that because i
mean<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.569> has<00:02:09.780> said<00:02:10.140> ton<00:02:10.619> more<00:02:10.920> pixels<00:02:11.280> because

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
mean it has said ton more pixels because

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.320 
mean it has said ton more pixels because
it's<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it's a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's a
1080p<00:02:12.870> display<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.820> we<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.090> go<00:02:15.240> ahead

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
1080p display and if we just go ahead

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.430 
1080p display and if we just go ahead
and<00:02:15.840> go<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.860> little<00:02:17.310> bit<00:02:17.460> here<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.380> try<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and go down a little bit here and try to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.370 
and go down a little bit here and try to
read<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.580> or<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.080> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
read that or you know you see that and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.720 
read that or you know you see that and
I'm<00:02:22.470> denim<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.250> ahead<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.490> go<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
I'm denim is going to go ahead and go to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.300 
I'm denim is going to go ahead and go to
the<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.870> other<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:27.470> do<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.800> see<00:02:29.100> a

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the to the other one do you see a

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.490 
the to the other one do you see a
difference<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.080> here<00:02:31.320> I'm

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
difference I can see here I'm

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.650 
difference I can see here I'm
transformer<00:02:31.920> prime<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.640> text<00:02:33.060> looks

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
transformer prime that the text looks

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.480 
transformer prime that the text looks
very<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.840> kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> hard<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.010> it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
very it's it's kind of hard because it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.330 
very it's it's kind of hard because it
needs<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.120> lot<00:02:39.300> more<00:02:39.510> pixels<00:02:40.010> but<00:02:41.010> when

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
needs to have lot more pixels but when

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.360 
needs to have lot more pixels but when
we<00:02:41.490> when<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> see<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.360> here<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.990> ipad<00:02:43.470> i<00:02:43.740> can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
we when I see it here on the ipad i can

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.470 
we when I see it here on the ipad i can
see<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.790> text<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.300> very<00:02:45.750> very<00:02:45.990> clear<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
see the text is very very clear but is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.030 
see the text is very very clear but is
it<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> be<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> big<00:02:49.380> deal<00:02:49.560> well<00:02:49.950> if

that you notice you can zoom in more on
the<00:03:27.660> Apple<00:03:27.989> iPad<00:03:28.080> as<00:03:28.410> well<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.730> browser

the Apple iPad as well in the browser
when<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.420> stop<00:03:30.840> browser<00:03:31.110> here<00:03:31.410> on<00:03:31.530> both<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.980> can

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
when we stop browser here on both I can

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.280 
when we stop browser here on both I can
only<00:03:32.640> swim<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.590> yeah<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> can't<00:03:35.010> go<00:03:35.250> any<00:03:36.290> further

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
only swim in yeah I can't go any further

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.800 
only swim in yeah I can't go any further
down<00:03:40.459> but<00:03:41.459> we<00:03:41.640> can<00:03:41.820> uh<00:03:41.970> maybe<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:42.450> so

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
down but we can uh maybe we can go so

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.920 
down but we can uh maybe we can go so
much<00:03:42.959> more<00:03:43.170> closed<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.220> ipad<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.970> of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
much more closed on that ipad and of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.080 
much more closed on that ipad and of
course<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.410> very<00:03:46.620> hard<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.760> a

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
course it's very hard here to see a

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.140 
course it's very hard here to see a
pixel<00:03:48.750> difference<00:03:49.550> but<00:03:50.550> most<00:03:50.760> people<00:03:51.090> are

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
pixel difference but most people are

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.530 
pixel difference but most people are
gonna<00:03:51.269> read<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.800> when<00:03:52.800> they<00:03:52.920> are<00:03:53.420> little<00:03:54.420> bit

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
gonna read it when they are little bit

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.160 
gonna read it when they are little bit
out<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:55.050> this<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:56.630> it's<00:03:57.630> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:57.989> that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
out like this and it's going to be that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
out like this and it's going to be that
a<00:03:58.230> big<00:03:58.500> deal<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:59.959> no<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:02.100> prolly<00:04:02.459> not

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
a big deal then no it's it's prolly not

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.270 
a big deal then no it's it's prolly not
going<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.850> be<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.000> out<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> big<00:04:03.390> deal<00:04:03.600> but<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.920> mean

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
going to be it out a big deal but I mean

going<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.169> be<00:04:31.230> down<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.470> big<00:04:31.770> difference<00:04:32.130> when

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
going to be down a big difference when

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.940 
going to be down a big difference when
you<00:04:32.700> have<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.060> much<00:04:33.270> more<00:04:33.480> pixels<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.230> 15<00:04:34.530> 36

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
you have so much more pixels on a 15 36

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.360 
you have so much more pixels on a 15 36
x<00:04:35.220> 2048<00:04:35.940> display<00:04:36.620> use<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> very<00:04:37.889> quickly<00:04:38.160> look

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370

here<00:04:38.700> on<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.600> browser<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.470> i<00:04:40.650> said<00:04:41.000> not<00:04:42.000> a

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
here on the browser as i said not a

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.320 
here on the browser as i said not a
video<00:04:42.210> where<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.660> show<00:04:42.780> off<00:04:43.110> some<00:04:43.370> PDF<00:04:44.370> ebook

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
video where I show off some PDF ebook

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.730 
video where I show off some PDF ebook
reading<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.050> made<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.380> video<00:04:46.590> about

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
reading but I made you a video about

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.980 
reading but I made you a video about
that<00:04:47.040> as<00:04:47.130> well<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.240> quick<00:04:48.450> video<00:04:48.600> here

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
that as well but this quick video here

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.020 
that as well but this quick video here
so<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.320> can<00:04:49.710> go<00:04:49.830> ahead<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.070> judge<00:04:50.460> for

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
so you can go ahead and judge for

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.820 
so you can go ahead and judge for
yourself<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.660> I'm<00:04:51.960> sure<00:04:52.230> if<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.380> can<00:04:52.560> see<00:04:52.620> it

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
yourself and I'm sure if you can see it

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.860 
yourself and I'm sure if you can see it
as<00:04:53.100> good<00:04:53.370> when<00:04:53.669> I'm<00:04:53.790> recording<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:54.240> video<00:04:54.389> of

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
as good when I'm recording a video of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.920 
as good when I'm recording a video of
course<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:55.669> very<00:04:56.669> or<00:04:57.090> I<00:04:57.120> mean<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.750> course

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
course it's very or I mean of course

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.290 
course it's very or I mean of course
it's<00:04:58.169> better<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.680> use<00:04:59.400> go<00:04:59.610> ahead<00:04:59.850> and<00:04:59.940> go<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.180> a

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
it's better to use go ahead and go to a

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.820 
it's better to use go ahead and go to a
store<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.660> try<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.080> see<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.290> difference<00:05:01.710> over

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
store and try to see the difference over

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.370 
store and try to see the difference over
there<00:05:02.130> because<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.510> actually<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.230> much

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
there because it is actually so much

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.909 
there because it is actually so much
easier<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.890> see<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.610> real<00:05:05.640> life<00:05:05.850> but<00:05:06.919> judge

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
easier to see it in real life but judge

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.480 
easier to see it in real life but judge
for<00:05:08.220> yourself<00:05:08.610> see
