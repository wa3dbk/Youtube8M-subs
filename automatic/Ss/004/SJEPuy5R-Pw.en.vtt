00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.610
 As you can see , it is now about the elevator 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.340
 we showed in the tutorial how 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.940
 you build that is just this 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.689
 here original from the tutorial and the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.000
 I changed something much bigger 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.359
 but as you can see here 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.910
 I've been praying in the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.969
 comments I have a floor 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 built in as he stood there 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.910
 I rebuilt that so that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.149
 could use floor and that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 In total there are now seven floors 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.300
 and of course you can go to each one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.450
 go down the stage and from each 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.950
 leave again 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 but he is naturally become larger 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.829
 because I have some decisions 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 had to add then so here comes 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 almost to the first floor, for example 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 or to the ground floor in the end and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.539
 then I have a great performance where you can 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.129
 can choose a floor and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.930
 then you run quickly into the elevator 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.559
 So you have had some time 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.210
 we'll come in and drop 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 you also clicked on the floors 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.720
 for example, chose floor 2 1 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.320
 so if I drove in stage two 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.510
 as you can see here 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 yes and from here I can almost 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.820
 continue down or up 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.360
 I just know the sixth 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.360
 floor 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 July 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.700
 So I already expected to cover 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.969
 I have actually seen im 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.170
 sixth floor lands and now can 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.250
 I can go back from here 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:42.189
 go down I'm fast times 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.189
 into the floor 3 hello 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:48.609
 good and then I'm already in the third 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.210
 course what the course 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.329
 most interesting and important 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.799
 The most difficult function is the reputation 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.459
 button if i am here now on the call 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.109
 then comes the elevator button 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:05.030
 approached after a short while now 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:06.819
 has him there even with water skis even yes 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.560
 So as you can see I have one 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.360
 floor built into the system that 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.220
 I completely work completely 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.140
 can go anywhere from anywhere 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.840
 everywhere and can the elevator also in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.700
 should also call the respective position 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.620
 kart driven so 1 4 for example too 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.150
 just fine on the seventh floor that's the one 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.709
 technology that I had to build if 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.890
 you compare that over here original 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.530
 here conversion is really much to it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.530
 come 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.819
 these lines here let the elevator 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.349
 turn off 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.510
 as you can see, of course 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.250
 first floor or the second floor from 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.209
 Go 0 1100 it is only one line 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.769
 up here are already 243 and so on 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 continue until the top until it stops 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.569
 six floors you can choose 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.769
 and on the opposite side 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:05.239
 Here are the ones to buy 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:09.709
 These are these and these turquoise 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.169
 lines are the call buttons the calls 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.280
 especially then go back once 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.280
 and in each case forward 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.630
 The technique is pretty complicated 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.180
 been installed and I had to go here too 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.849
 to change something inside 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.019
 These systems here let the worries 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.090
 for that the elevator is a real one 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.919
 put on hearth for the lead on line 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.019
 and the whole back for the 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.310
 down the line as you can see if you 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.049
 that compares to original 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.669
 there is a lot of work behind it 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.349
 if you install so many floors 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.160
 want 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.049
 and there are also some 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.519
 restrictions put in floors 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:48.230
 the ideal shape would be if the floors 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.050
 three are high inside and next to 1 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.250
 ceiling height 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.790
 or ground floor and holding am3 height so 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.700
 4 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.730
 in total so who wanted the proof 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.920
 Here he is you can in this elevator 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.620
 install these municipalities 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.120
 I hope you liked it and yes 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.810
 if you have more wishes then 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.290
 write in the comments 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.530
 Naturally 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.530
 there 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.510
