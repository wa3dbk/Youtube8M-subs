in<00:00:09.690> plank<00:00:10.110> position<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.889> often<00:00:11.250> helpful<00:00:11.400> to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
in plank position it's often helpful to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.870 
in plank position it's often helpful to
imagine<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.389> zone<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.679> zone<00:00:13.710> you're<00:00:14.490> trying

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
imagine the zone the zone you're trying

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.910 
imagine the zone the zone you're trying
to<00:00:14.969> get<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> cue<00:00:15.480> ball<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.590> often

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to get the cue ball into it's often

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.179 
to get the cue ball into it's often
wedge-shaped<00:00:17.480> look<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.830> we're<00:00:19.830> cutting<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
wedge-shaped look here we're cutting the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.400 
wedge-shaped look here we're cutting the
14<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> trying<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.630> get<00:00:21.779> positioned<00:00:22.260> on

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
14 in and trying to get positioned on

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
14 in and trying to get positioned on
the<00:00:22.470> 8<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:23.580> anywhere<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.840> zone<00:00:26.990> would<00:00:27.990> be

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the 8 now anywhere in this zone would be

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.169 
the 8 now anywhere in this zone would be
okay<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.650> position<00:00:29.279> you'd<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> shot<00:00:30.000> at

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
okay for position you'd have a shot at

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.769 
okay for position you'd have a shot at
the<00:00:30.300> 8

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the 8

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.350

so<00:00:31.260> try<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.980> cross<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.730> narrow<00:00:33.030> neck<00:00:33.120> of

so try not to cross the narrow neck of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.870 
so try not to cross the narrow neck of
the<00:00:33.630> zone<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> cut<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> 14<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> have

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the zone if you cut the 14 in and have

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.670 
the zone if you cut the 14 in and have
any<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.420> hand<00:00:36.660> English<00:00:37.050> you're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.530> to

any right hand English you're going to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
any right hand English you're going to
bring<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> cue<00:00:38.219> ball<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.790> along<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.840> path

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
bring the cue ball down along this path

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
bring the cue ball down along this path
and<00:00:40.469> you'll<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.910> precise<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and you'll have to be very precise to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.190 
and you'll have to be very precise to
stop<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> cue<00:00:43.350> ball<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:43.890> along<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.820> line

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
stop the cue ball right along this line

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
stop the cue ball right along this line
without<00:00:46.200> English<00:00:46.440> you'll<00:00:47.370> toss<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> wider

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
without English you'll toss the wider

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
without English you'll toss the wider
part<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> wedge<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:49.950> more

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
part of the wedge and have much more

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.319 
part of the wedge and have much more
freedom<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.090> much<00:00:51.690> greater<00:00:51.989> margin<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> error

sometimes<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.600> zone<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.890> huge<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:58.170> this

now<00:00:59.850> you're<00:01:00.090> cutting<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> 14<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> be

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
now you're cutting the 14 in you can be

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
now you're cutting the 14 in you can be
anywhere<00:01:02.190> from<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.470> to<00:01:04.470> about<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> huge

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
their minds the size of that zone it
would<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> major<00:01:16.950> offense<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.270> shot<00:01:18.509> like

shot and you have a very large margin of
error<00:02:49.080> that's<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.980> useful<00:02:50.340> concept<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.940> comes

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060

of error it's coming over here bring
this<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.239> along<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> line<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:02.280> position
