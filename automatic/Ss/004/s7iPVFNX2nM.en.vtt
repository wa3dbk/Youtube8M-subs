00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
the head band over your head like so and
I'm<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.480> taking<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.200> small<00:00:49.620> section

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I'm going to be taking a small section

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
I'm going to be taking a small section
like<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:52.219> recommend<00:00:53.219> starting<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like so I recommend starting on the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
like so I recommend starting on the
front<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:56.010> easier<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
front because that way it's easier to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.560 
front because that way it's easier to
work<00:00:56.940> with

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.200 

so<00:01:02.570> basically<00:01:03.489> we're<00:01:04.489> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.699> do<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.000> we're

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
so basically we're going to do is we're

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.969 
so basically we're going to do is we're
just<00:01:05.239> going<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.630> wrap<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.050> hair<00:01:06.290> over<00:01:06.830> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
just going to wrap the hair over the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.300 
just going to wrap the hair over the
head<00:01:07.159> bend<00:01:07.400> I<00:01:11.260> like<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.380> put<00:01:12.560> my<00:01:12.590> fingers<00:01:13.040> in

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
head bend I like to put my fingers in

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.950 
head bend I like to put my fingers in
between<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.850> head<00:01:13.970> been<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.510> hair<00:01:14.720> so

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
between the head been in the hair so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.109 
between the head been in the hair so
that<00:01:15.140> way<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:16.100> wrap<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.090> hair<00:01:17.360> neatly<00:01:19.119> so

ahead and wrap your hair over to the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.810 
ahead and wrap your hair over to the
previous<00:02:49.380> trapped<00:02:49.710> hair<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.610> makes

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
previous trapped hair if that makes

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.420 
previous trapped hair if that makes
sense<00:02:56.960> but<00:02:57.960> keep<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.380> mind<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.770> these<00:02:58.980> curls

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
sense but keep in mind that these curls

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.940 
sense but keep in mind that these curls
will<00:02:59.730> be<00:02:59.910> looser<00:03:00.480> than<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.900> rest<00:03:01.140> because

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
will be looser than the rest because

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.520 
will be looser than the rest because
they're<00:03:02.190> wrapped<00:03:02.490> over<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.840> previous<00:03:04.050> hair

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
they're wrapped over the previous hair

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.380 
they're wrapped over the previous hair
not<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> actual<00:03:05.460> headband<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.090> I'm<00:03:09.210> just

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
not the actual headband so I'm just

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.950 
not the actual headband so I'm just
going<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> tuck<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.170> hair<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:11.460> so<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.660> that

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
going to tuck the hair like so so that

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.840 
going to tuck the hair like so so that
they're<00:03:13.350> more<00:03:13.530> secure<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.130> there<00:03:14.460> won't<00:03:14.580> come
