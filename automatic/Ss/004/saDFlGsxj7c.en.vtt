00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.160 
travels across the board sometimes they
move<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.769> little<00:00:38.039> too<00:00:38.399> slow<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:39.510> Queen<00:00:39.780> King

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
move a little too slow the Queen King

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
move a little too slow the Queen King
and<00:00:40.319> Knight<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.769> particular<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.429> guilty<00:00:41.789> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and Knight in particular are guilty of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.360 
and Knight in particular are guilty of
being<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.359> slow<00:00:42.569> side<00:00:42.979> but<00:00:43.979> the<00:00:44.069> King<00:00:44.249> can

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
being on the slow side but the King can

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.340 
being on the slow side but the King can
only<00:00:44.519> move<00:00:44.729> one<00:00:44.789> square<00:00:45.149> per<00:00:45.510> move<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.199> that's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
only move one square per move so that's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
only move one square per move so that's
forgivable<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.699> Queen<00:00:47.909> can<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.329> many

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
forgivable but the Queen can go as many

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.419 
forgivable but the Queen can go as many
spaces<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.050> she<00:00:49.199> wants<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.859> waiting<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.309> her

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
spaces as she wants so waiting on her

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.489 
spaces as she wants so waiting on her
can<00:00:50.639> be<00:00:50.760> time-consuming<00:00:54.079> come<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.260> move

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
can be time-consuming come on move

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.879 
can be time-consuming come on move
faster<00:00:55.889> you<00:00:55.979> bitch<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.289> knight<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> even

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
faster you bitch the knight is even

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:00.619 
faster you bitch the knight is even
slower<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.549> when<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> jumps<00:01:00.210> other<00:01:00.359> pieces

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
slower and when it jumps other pieces

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
slower and when it jumps other pieces
they<00:01:01.289> move<00:01:01.469> out<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.799> waveform<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
they move out of the waveform which is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.240 
they move out of the waveform which is
amusing<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.959> waiting<00:01:04.229> 15<00:01:04.559> seconds<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.129> one

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
amusing but waiting 15 seconds for one

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.179 
amusing but waiting 15 seconds for one
move<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> play<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.210> test<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.570> patience

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
move to play out can test your patience

chess<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.430> game<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.640> patience<00:01:09.149> anyway<00:01:09.539> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
chess is a game of patience anyway but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
chess is a game of patience anyway but
this<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:10.380> drag<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> game<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this will drag the game on a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.029 
this will drag the game on a little
longer<00:01:11.700> than<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> should<00:01:12.590> when<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.860> one

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
longer than it should when you take one

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.859 
longer than it should when you take one
of<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.250> opponent's<00:01:14.670> pieces<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> see

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
of your opponent's pieces you get to see

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.270 
of your opponent's pieces you get to see
a<00:01:15.899> battle<00:01:16.110> sequence<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.829> the<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:17.070> pieces

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a battle sequence where the two pieces

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
a battle sequence where the two pieces
Duke<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.149> obviously<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.560> piece<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
Duke it out and obviously the piece that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.249 
Duke it out and obviously the piece that
is<00:01:20.070> taken<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.880> falls<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
is taken is the one that falls and you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
is taken is the one that falls and you
won't<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.799> old<00:01:23.009> battle<00:01:23.399> every<00:01:23.640> time

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
won't get the same old battle every time

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
won't get the same old battle every time
for<00:01:24.840> every<00:01:24.899> combination<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.740> pieces<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.250> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
for every combination of pieces is a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
for every combination of pieces is a
different<00:01:26.670> sequence<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.869> example

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
different sequence for example

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
different sequence for example
every<00:01:28.619> time<00:01:28.859> a<00:01:28.890> pawn<00:01:29.189> takes<00:01:29.460> another<00:01:29.700> pawn

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
every time a pawn takes another pawn

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.599 
every time a pawn takes another pawn
you'll<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.109> same<00:01:31.289> battle<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.310> it'll<00:01:32.490> be

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
you'll see the same battle but it'll be

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.010 
you'll see the same battle but it'll be
much<00:01:32.789> different<00:01:33.210> when<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> pawn<00:01:33.600> takes<00:01:33.899> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
much different when the pawn takes a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
much different when the pawn takes a
knight<00:01:34.579> there<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.670> 35<00:01:36.060> different<00:01:36.240> sequences

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
knight there are 35 different sequences

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
knight there are 35 different sequences
altogether<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.009> watch<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.429> of<00:01:38.549> them

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
boards and was able to become pretty

thing<00:04:01.989> that's<00:04:02.139> kind<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.439> odd<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.769> how<00:04:02.889> the

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
thing that's kind of odd is how the

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:04.740 
thing that's kind of odd is how the
pieces<00:04:03.250> are<00:04:03.519> red<00:04:03.729> and<00:04:03.879> blue<00:04:04.060> instead<00:04:04.479> of<00:04:04.569> black

pieces are red and blue instead of black
and<00:04:04.959> white<00:04:04.989> like<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.409> traditional<00:04:05.919> chessboard

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
and white like a traditional chessboard

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.509 
and white like a traditional chessboard
even<00:04:07.329> when<00:04:07.479> you<00:04:07.569> use<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.870> 2d<00:04:08.079> pieces<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.459> I

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
even when you use the 2d pieces but I

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.979 
even when you use the 2d pieces but I
guess<00:04:09.729> for<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.000> sake<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.449> game<00:04:10.720> they

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
guess for the sake of this game they

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.409 
guess for the sake of this game they
look<00:04:11.139> better<00:04:11.319> colorful<00:04:11.939> it's<00:04:12.939> also<00:04:13.150> hilarious

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
look better colorful it's also hilarious

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.539 
look better colorful it's also hilarious
how<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:13.989> rook<00:04:14.229> starts<00:04:14.560> off<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:14.829> a<00:04:14.859> castle<00:04:15.400> and

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
how the rook starts off as a castle and

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.610 
how the rook starts off as a castle and
morphs<00:04:15.970> into<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.209> brick<00:04:16.539> monster<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.049> sorts<00:04:17.409> and

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
morphs into a brick monster of sorts and

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.770 
morphs into a brick monster of sorts and
turns<00:04:18.280> back<00:04:18.549> into<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.820> castle<00:04:19.120> after<00:04:19.359> landing

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
turns back into a castle after landing

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.620 
turns back into a castle after landing
on<00:04:19.900> its<00:04:20.049> space<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.880> sound<00:04:22.150> could<00:04:22.360> have<00:04:22.479> been

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
on its space the sound could have been

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.250 
on its space the sound could have been
improved<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.110> bit<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:24.070> opening<00:04:24.370> theme<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.610> cool

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
improved a bit the opening theme is cool

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.690 
improved a bit the opening theme is cool
but<00:04:25.470> some<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.860> sound<00:04:26.130> effects<00:04:26.550> are

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
but some of the sound effects are

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.110 
but some of the sound effects are
distorted<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.390> bit<00:04:27.600> muddy<00:04:28.970> overall<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
distorted and a bit muddy overall the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.390 
distorted and a bit muddy overall the
game<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.300> definitely<00:04:30.540> fun<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.860> only<00:04:32.040> thing<00:04:32.220> is

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
game is definitely fun the only thing is

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.190 
game is definitely fun the only thing is
because<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.000> pieces<00:04:33.300> take<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.480> bit<00:04:33.720> of<00:04:33.750> time<00:04:33.990> to

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
because the pieces take a bit of time to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480 
because the pieces take a bit of time to
move<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.770> battles<00:04:35.100> keep<00:04:35.280> happening
