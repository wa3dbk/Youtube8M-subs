 now what we put a bit of mushrooms 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.840
 that means 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:40.590
 how do they make you hungry? 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.810
 customers I offer I make them sit and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.790
 little lepontine little to drink 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.150
 what are the difficulties of this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.830
 I mean work I imagine that not marine 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.940

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.100
 willingly 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.509
 surely the binomial is not that of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.600
 do this job 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.440
 and what you want to do let's say I'm in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.090
 studying to become an actress though 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.790
 you don't know but you want to invite us some 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.950
 theatrical show sure as no if 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.890
 want when you say 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.470
 and in a while I also go to Milan 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.860
 little woman among the and then in Rome you are there 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.040
 Rome will be June 23 we will do one 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.890
 show where at the Olympic theater 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.000
 simone and anna we are with the couple of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 local the fourth you are together is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.140
 very much like this this story 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.970
 of love you are happy we are well 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.390
 but I know that simone is a great man 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.090
 roma is a great love of Rome 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.270
 therefore it takes some time then of 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.350
 lamentations 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.030
 and rightly we are with enzo rimicci 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.240
 president of the Sunflower Inn 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.940
 here is the essence of this project 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.100
 the essence of this project and give dignity 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.930
 working guys who normally are 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.510
 considered unrelated to the world of work 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.330
 and therefore what we we 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.390
 prefixes as a synthesis consortium to which it has 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.210
 joined the inn of the sunflowers is that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.740
 to put at the center and combine the 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.050
 social with economic sustainability 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.060
 of a project that sees the boys 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.250
 work every day and confront each other 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.990
 with a job market and after a while 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:40.920
 talk time to eat 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:40.920
 it's true you think I have to tell you
