hello everybody this video is going to

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.769 
hello everybody this video is going to
be<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.210> mandibular<00:00:03.720> canine<00:00:05.779> first

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
be about the mandibular canine first

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.620 
be about the mandibular canine first
we'll<00:00:06.990> go<00:00:07.140> over<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.440> shape<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.099> tooth

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
we'll go over the shape of the tooth

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.810 
we'll go over the shape of the tooth
from<00:00:09.630> buccal<00:00:10.380> or<00:00:10.500> lingual<00:00:10.559> view<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.550> tooth<00:00:11.730> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
from buccal or lingual view the tooth is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.370 
from buccal or lingual view the tooth is
going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> be<00:00:12.150> shaped<00:00:12.389> like<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> Pentagon

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
going to be shaped like a Pentagon

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740 
going to be shaped like a Pentagon
I'm<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.980> mesial<00:00:14.490> distal<00:00:14.519> view<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.389> gonna<00:00:15.540> be

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
I'm a mesial distal view it's gonna be

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.250 
I'm a mesial distal view it's gonna be
triangular<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.880> then<00:00:17.880> from<00:00:18.240> an<00:00:18.359> incisal<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
triangular and then from an incisal it's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.609 
triangular and then from an incisal it's
gonna<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.619> shaped<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.220> diamond<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.619> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
gonna be shaped like a diamond or you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.800 
gonna be shaped like a diamond or you
might<00:00:22.800> see<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.210> described<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.330> being<00:00:24.449> oval

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
might see it described as being oval

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.230 
might see it described as being oval
okay<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> shape<00:00:28.289> you'll<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> couple

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
okay the shape you'll see a couple

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.080 
okay the shape you'll see a couple
questions<00:00:30.240> come<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.199> occasionally

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
questions come up on this occasionally

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
questions come up on this occasionally
regarding<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> outline<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.070> facial<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
regarding the outline of the facial and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
regarding the outline of the facial and
so<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> facial<00:00:37.170> outline<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.770> viewed<00:00:38.100> from

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so the facial outline when viewed from

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.819 
so the facial outline when viewed from
the<00:00:38.489> proximal<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.329> made<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.590> one

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the proximal is made up of one

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.299 
the proximal is made up of one
continuous<00:00:41.610> arc<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> look<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
continuous arc and so if you look at the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750 
continuous arc and so if you look at the
shape<00:00:45.079> right<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.800> smooth<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
shape right here it's just smooth and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.930 
shape right here it's just smooth and
it's<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.450> arc<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.559> different<00:00:50.129> then

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it's one arc and this is different then

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's one arc and this is different then
the<00:00:51.660> max<00:00:51.989> lurking<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.680> has<00:00:52.860> three

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the max lurking on which has three

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.819 
the max lurking on which has three
planes<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.660> put<00:00:54.840> board<00:00:55.110> question<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.649> day

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
planes and I put board question all day

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
planes and I put board question all day
long<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.579> you'll<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
long because you'll see this a lot on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
long because you'll see this a lot on
the<00:00:57.570> practice<00:00:57.989> tests<00:01:00.620> alright<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> mesial

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the practice tests alright the mesial

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
the practice tests alright the mesial
outline<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:03.059> viewed<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> facial<00:01:04.460> from

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
outline when viewed from the facial from

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.340 
outline when viewed from the facial from
the<00:01:05.610> contact<00:01:06.090> area<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> root<00:01:06.990> apex

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the contact area down to the root apex

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.490 
the contact area down to the root apex
is<00:01:07.560> pretty<00:01:07.860> straight<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> mesial<00:01:10.049> axial

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
is pretty straight the mesial axial

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
is pretty straight the mesial axial
surface<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.610> parallel<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
surface is going to be parallel to the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.109 
surface is going to be parallel to the
long<00:01:12.750> axis<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> tooth<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
long axis of the tooth so on the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
long axis of the tooth so on the
mandibular<00:01:15.509> canine<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.970> two<00:01:18.259> areas<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
mandibular canine we've got two areas of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.050 
mandibular canine we've got two areas of
the<00:01:19.439> tooth<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.549> questions<00:01:20.700> from

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the tooth we can take questions from

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.810 
the tooth we can take questions from
regarding<00:01:21.479> shape<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.040> facial<00:01:23.369> outline<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
regarding shape so the facial outline is

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.899 
regarding shape so the facial outline is
going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.420> continuous<00:01:24.689> arc<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.909> then

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
going to be one continuous arc and then

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
going to be one continuous arc and then
the<00:01:27.119> mesial<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.820> pretty<00:01:29.820> much

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the mesial is going to be pretty much

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
the mesial is going to be pretty much
parallel<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> long<00:01:30.990> axis<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.500> root

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
parallel to the long axis of the root

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
parallel to the long axis of the root
and<00:01:31.920> you'll<00:01:32.220> occasionally<00:01:32.640> get<00:01:33.090> questions

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and you'll occasionally get questions

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.569 
and you'll occasionally get questions
and<00:01:33.869> ask<00:01:35.090> something<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.579> two

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and ask something like you have two

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.420 
and ask something like you have two
teeth<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.299> hands<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.950> describe

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
teeth in your hands and it will describe

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.179 
teeth in your hands and it will describe
the<00:01:41.909> tooth<00:01:42.470> anatomy<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> you'll<00:01:44.040> have

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the tooth anatomy to you and you'll have

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.480 
the tooth anatomy to you and you'll have
to<00:01:44.340> decide<00:01:44.930> if<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.350> tooth<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.280> right

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to decide if the tooth is on the right

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.920 
to decide if the tooth is on the right
side<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> mouth<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> left<00:01:48.540> side<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
side of the mouth or the left side of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
side of the mouth or the left side of
the<00:01:48.990> mouth<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> good<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
the mouth and so this is a good way to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.280 
the mouth and so this is a good way to
determine<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> contact<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
determine that in a contact on the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.109 
determine that in a contact on the
mesial<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:56.159> gonna<00:01:56.280> be<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> incisal

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
mesial it's gonna be in the incisal

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.170 
mesial it's gonna be in the incisal
third<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> distal<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.030> gonna

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
third and then on the distal it's gonna

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.109 
third and then on the distal it's gonna
be<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> middle<00:02:00.600> third<00:02:01.280> okay<00:02:02.280> size<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
be in the middle third okay size is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.959 
be in the middle third okay size is
another<00:02:03.570> area<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.549> you'll<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:05.909> of

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
another area that you'll see a lot of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.930 
another area that you'll see a lot of
questions<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> tooth<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> longest

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
questions on this tooth has the longest

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.809 
questions on this tooth has the longest
crown<00:02:09.500> you'll<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.679> questions<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
crown you'll see questions on that and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.680 
crown you'll see questions on that and
then<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.200> second

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
then it's the second

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.960 
then it's the second
longest<00:02:14.050> tooth<00:02:14.680> overall<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.640> we're<00:02:15.790> talking

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
longest tooth overall so we're talking

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.710 
longest tooth overall so we're talking
crown<00:02:16.540> plus<00:02:17.200> root<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.330> maxilla

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
crown plus root here so the maxilla

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.380 
crown plus root here so the maxilla
canine<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> longest<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.460> then<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.210> has<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
canine is the longest and then it has a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.810 
canine is the longest and then it has a
second<00:02:22.960> longest<00:02:23.320> route<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.950> remember<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
second longest route and remember the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.070 
second longest route and remember the
maxillary<00:02:25.390> canine<00:02:26.050> has<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.920> longest<00:02:27.280> route

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
maxillary canine has the longest route

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.850 
maxillary canine has the longest route
you'll<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:30.750> questions<00:02:31.750> about<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> facial

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
you'll see questions about the facial

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
you'll see questions about the facial
lingual<00:02:33.250> measurement<00:02:33.820> in<00:02:34.570> cane<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.140> if<00:02:35.260> we're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
lingual measurement in cane so if we're

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.980 
lingual measurement in cane so if we're
looking<00:02:35.830> at<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> facial<00:02:36.580> right<00:02:37.210> here<00:02:37.780> and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
looking at the facial right here and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.850 
looking at the facial right here and
then<00:02:38.620> removing<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> lingual<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:41.320> facial

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
then removing to the lingual the facial

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.550 
then removing to the lingual the facial
lingual<00:02:42.280> measurement<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.940> greater<00:02:43.930> than<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
lingual measurement is greater than the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.190 
lingual measurement is greater than the
mesial<00:02:45.040> distal<00:02:45.070> measurement<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.110> a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
mesial distal measurement and so it's a

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.840 
mesial distal measurement and so it's a
longer<00:02:47.440> tooth<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.130> facial<00:02:48.550> lingual

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
longer tooth in a facial lingual

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.520 
longer tooth in a facial lingual
direction<00:02:49.240> than<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.050> mesial

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
direction than it is in a mesial

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.560 
direction than it is in a mesial
direction<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.370> mesial<00:02:51.820> distal<00:02:51.850> direction

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
direction in a mesial distal direction

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.870 
direction in a mesial distal direction
and<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.740> same<00:02:53.980> as<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.490> maxillary

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
and that is the same as the maxillary

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.240 
and that is the same as the maxillary
canine<00:02:57.000> alright<00:02:58.000> lingual<00:02:58.360> anatomy<00:02:58.960> is<00:02:59.250> one

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
canine alright lingual anatomy is one

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.660 
canine alright lingual anatomy is one
way<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.550> distinguish<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:02.230> tooth<00:03:02.560> from<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
way to distinguish this tooth from the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.260 
way to distinguish this tooth from the
maxillary<00:03:04.120> canine<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.370> recall<00:03:06.790> when

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
maxillary canine so if you recall when

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.330 
maxillary canine so if you recall when
we<00:03:07.330> talked<00:03:07.660> about<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> maxillary<00:03:08.350> canine<00:03:08.920> in

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
we talked about the maxillary canine in

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.640 
we talked about the maxillary canine in
the<00:03:09.490> last<00:03:09.670> video<00:03:10.030> we<00:03:10.810> mentioned<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> lingual

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
the last video we mentioned the lingual

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.200 
the last video we mentioned the lingual
Ridge<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.400> how<00:03:12.580> there's<00:03:12.790> some<00:03:13.000> very

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
Ridge and how there's some very

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.870 
Ridge and how there's some very
distinctive<00:03:13.720> anatomy<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.280> lingual<00:03:15.670> of

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
distinctive anatomy on the lingual of

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.930 
distinctive anatomy on the lingual of
the<00:03:15.970> tooth<00:03:16.210> whereas<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.100> mandibular<00:03:18.520> canine

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the tooth whereas the mandibular canine

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.210 
the tooth whereas the mandibular canine
it's<00:03:19.150> pretty<00:03:19.420> flat<00:03:19.780> on<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.350> lingual<00:03:20.650> side<00:03:20.890> so

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
it's pretty flat on the lingual side so

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's pretty flat on the lingual side so
it's<00:03:21.340> relatively<00:03:21.730> flat<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.239> fossa<00:03:22.450> area

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it's relatively flat in the fossa area

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.010 
it's relatively flat in the fossa area
poorly<00:03:24.040> developed<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.880> marg<00:03:25.120> marginal

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
poorly developed in the marg marginal

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.840 
poorly developed in the marg marginal
Ridge<00:03:26.260> area<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.950> then<00:03:27.160> has<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.520> poorly

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
Ridge area and then has a poorly

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.270 
Ridge area and then has a poorly
developed<00:03:28.060> cingulum<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.130> is

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
developed cingulum and so this is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.060 
developed cingulum and so this is
another<00:03:30.580> way<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.330> distinguish

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
another way that you can distinguish

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.540 
another way that you can distinguish
upper<00:03:33.070> canines<00:03:33.430> from<00:03:33.580> lower<00:03:33.820> canines

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
upper canines from lower canines

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.130 
upper canines from lower canines
all<00:03:36.550> right<00:03:36.670> cusp<00:03:36.910> tip<00:03:37.239> you'll<00:03:37.510> see<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.900> kind

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
all right cusp tip you'll see this kind

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.190 
all right cusp tip you'll see this kind
of<00:03:38.200> lingo<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.830> test<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.280> lot<00:03:39.459> so<00:03:40.360> the<00:03:40.870> cusps

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
of lingo on the test a lot so the cusps

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.740 
of lingo on the test a lot so the cusps
tip<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.910> this<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.300> you're<00:03:43.450> looking<00:03:43.540> at

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
tip is and this is if you're looking at

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.630 
tip is and this is if you're looking at
it<00:03:43.840> from<00:03:43.930> an<00:03:44.019> incisal<00:03:44.530> direction<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.370> cusps

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
it from an incisal direction the cusps

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.600 
it from an incisal direction the cusps
tip<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.150> lingual<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.620> facial<00:03:47.920> lingual

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
tip is lingual to the facial lingual

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.650 
tip is lingual to the facial lingual
long<00:03:48.910> axis<00:03:49.590> bisector<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:51.670> here's<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.450> question

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
long axis bisector so here's a question

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.080 
long axis bisector so here's a question
for<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.260> from<00:03:53.440> an<00:03:54.070> in<00:03:54.220> sisal<00:03:54.700> view<00:03:54.880> which

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
for you from an in sisal view which

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.960 
for you from an in sisal view which
surface<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.110> going<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.530> more<00:03:56.680> visible<00:03:57.220> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
surface is going to be more visible the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.130 
surface is going to be more visible the
facial<00:03:58.540> or<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:59.019> lingual<00:03:59.380> surface<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.180> so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
facial or the lingual surface and so

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.490 
facial or the lingual surface and so
here<00:04:02.709> we've<00:04:02.830> got<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.190> cusps<00:04:03.489> tip<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:05.290> we

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
here we've got the cusps tip and if we

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.740 
here we've got the cusps tip and if we
go<00:04:05.620> back<00:04:05.800> to<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.980> previous<00:04:06.190> slide<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:07.450> cusps

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
go back to the previous slide the cusps

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.890 
go back to the previous slide the cusps
tip<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:08.019> lingual<00:04:09.030> tends<00:04:10.030> towards<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.510> lingual

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
tip is lingual tends towards the lingual

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.930 
tip is lingual tends towards the lingual
and<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.800> we're<00:04:11.980> gonna<00:04:12.070> see<00:04:12.400> more<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
and so we're gonna see more of the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.680 
and so we're gonna see more of the
facial<00:04:13.630> than<00:04:14.110> we<00:04:14.260> are<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.560> lingual<00:04:15.299> all<00:04:16.299> right

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
facial than we are the lingual all right

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.020

the root this is gonna be the only tooth

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.000 
the root this is gonna be the only tooth

tooth isn't only or an exception

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.700 
tooth isn't only or an exception
we<00:04:27.039> got<00:04:27.190> a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
we got a

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.080 
we got a
remember<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.460> they<00:04:28.610> like<00:04:28.819> to<00:04:28.850> ask

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
remember that because they like to ask

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.529 
remember that because they like to ask
questions<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.229> kind<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.500> thing<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.850> the

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
questions on that kind of thing so the

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.749 
questions on that kind of thing so the
ant<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.410> tooth<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.889> the<00:04:34.069> anterior<00:04:34.490> tooth

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
ant this tooth is the anterior tooth

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.540 
ant this tooth is the anterior tooth
most<00:04:35.180> likely<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.020> have<00:04:36.259> a<00:04:36.289> bifurcated<00:04:37.250> root

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
most likely to have a bifurcated root

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.689 
most likely to have a bifurcated root
okay<00:04:38.509> and<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:38.960> that's<00:04:39.770> more<00:04:40.039> often<00:04:40.460> than

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
okay and so that's more often than

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.980 
okay and so that's more often than
maxillary<00:04:41.389> canine<00:04:41.930> maxillary<00:04:42.410> central<00:04:42.979> and

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
maxillary canine maxillary central and

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.659 
maxillary canine maxillary central and
all<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.319> rest<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.680> let<00:04:45.800> me<00:04:45.889> see<00:04:46.099> here<00:04:46.370> so

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
all the rest of let me see here so

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.999 
all the rest of let me see here so
that's<00:04:47.599> that's<00:04:47.990> something<00:04:48.169> you<00:04:48.500> might<00:04:48.650> see
