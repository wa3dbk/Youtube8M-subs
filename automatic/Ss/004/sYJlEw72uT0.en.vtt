way of doing this now I've got my other

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.740 
way of doing this now I've got my other
pivots<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> wrong<00:00:09.599> spot<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.160> I<00:00:11.160> can<00:00:11.750> select

the other drawings that I'm interested

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.429 
the other drawings that I'm interested
in<00:00:23.400> updating<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.210> then<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.410> click

in updating and then I can right click
and<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.609> do<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> paste<00:00:27.330> special<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
and I can do a paste special and when I

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.650 
and I can do a paste special and when I
do<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.670> paste<00:00:30.179> special<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.590> go<00:00:32.040> into

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
do the paste special if you go into

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.180 
do the paste special if you go into
advanced<00:00:33.660> then<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.040> an

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
advanced then you see that there's an

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
advanced then you see that there's an
option<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.059> says<00:00:36.300> update<00:00:36.600> drawing

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
option here that says update drawing

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130 
option here that says update drawing
pivot<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.670> select<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.360> option<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
pivot so if I select that option and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.430 
pivot so if I select that option and
click<00:00:40.170> OK<00:00:40.980> you'll<00:00:41.670> notice<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> also<00:00:42.809> updates

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
click OK you'll notice that also updates

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
click OK you'll notice that also updates
the<00:00:43.649> pivot<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.219> drawings<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> way

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the pivot on my drawings so in a way

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
the pivot on my drawings so in a way
that<00:00:46.350> way<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.649> faster<00:00:46.890> because<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:47.730> say<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that way is faster because let's say you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
that way is faster because let's say you
had<00:00:48.149> 20<00:00:48.539> drawings<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.469> don't<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> flip

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
had 20 drawings you don't have to flip

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.830 
had 20 drawings you don't have to flip
back<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.730> forth<00:00:50.969> through<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.510> different

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
back and forth through the different

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.229 
back and forth through the different
drawings<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> paste<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> pivot<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.789> both<00:00:54.000> ways

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
drawings to paste the pivot so both ways

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
drawings to paste the pivot so both ways
are<00:00:54.420> equally<00:00:54.809> good<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.440> different<00:00:55.710> scenarios

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
are equally good for different scenarios

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.069 
are equally good for different scenarios
and<00:00:56.879> they're<00:00:57.149> both<00:00:57.329> equally<00:00:58.050> valid<00:00:59.750> okay<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and they're both equally valid okay so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.189 
and they're both equally valid okay so
that's<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.010> copying<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> pivot<00:01:03.899> point

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that's about copying the pivot point

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
that's about copying the pivot point
from<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:05.129> drawing<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.549> another<00:01:05.760> drawing<00:01:06.000> now

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
from one drawing to another drawing now

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
from one drawing to another drawing now
the<00:01:06.720> last<00:01:07.260> thing<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> question<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.540> in

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the last thing I had a question on in

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.200 
the last thing I had a question on in
response<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> video<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:12.090> about

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
response to the video was what about

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
response to the video was what about
this<00:01:12.659> pivot<00:01:13.049> point<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.890> my

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this pivot point right here on my

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.240 
this pivot point right here on my
transform<00:01:14.490> tool<00:01:15.229> what<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> pivot<00:01:17.009> point

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
transform tool what is this pivot point

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
transform tool what is this pivot point
and<00:01:17.570> why<00:01:18.570> can't<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.290> pivot<00:01:19.950> point<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and why can't I use this pivot point to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
and why can't I use this pivot point to
set<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> pivot<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.799> pivot

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
set you know the pivot what this pivot

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
set you know the pivot what this pivot
point<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> select<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.390> drawing<00:01:24.720> layer

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
point is when you select a drawing layer

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.730 
point is when you select a drawing layer
or<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:26.100> peg<00:01:26.430> layer<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.810> any<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.590> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
or a peg layer or you know any kind of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.219 
or a peg layer or you know any kind of
layer<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.340> up<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> hierarchy<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> oh<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
layer if I go up to hierarchy and oh I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.600 
layer if I go up to hierarchy and oh I
don't<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> hierarchy<00:01:31.950> set<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.549> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
don't have a hierarchy set up on this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.800 
don't have a hierarchy set up on this
one<00:01:32.790> yet<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.270> were<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.630> up<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
one yet but if I were to go up the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.950 
one yet but if I were to go up the
hierarchy<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.560> other<00:01:34.860> drawing<00:01:35.460> layers

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
hierarchy to the other drawing layers

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
hierarchy to the other drawing layers
then<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.439> pivot<00:01:37.860> does<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.579> default

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
then what this pivot does is by default

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
then what this pivot does is by default
the<00:01:39.840> transform<00:01:40.500> tool<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.189> into

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the transform tool will take into

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
the transform tool will take into
account<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.090> pivot<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.200> already<00:01:43.470> been

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
account the pivot that has already been

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.550 
account the pivot that has already been
set<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> drawing<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> peg<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
set on that drawing or that peg so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.530 
set on that drawing or that peg so
that's<00:01:46.770> by<00:01:47.610> default<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.479> starting<00:01:49.409> location

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
that's by default it's starting location

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.050 
that's by default it's starting location
now<00:01:51.540> you'll<00:01:51.780> notice<00:01:51.869> though<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
now you'll notice though that you can

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.139 
now you'll notice though that you can
mouse<00:01:54.390> over<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.960> pivot<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.460> drag

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
mouse over this pivot and you can drag

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.530 
mouse over this pivot and you can drag
it<00:01:57.210> around<00:01:57.619> when<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.799> drag<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it around when you drag it you see that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.260 
it around when you drag it you see that
there's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> ghost<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.430> still<00:02:02.820> there

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
there's a ghost there that's still there

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.889 
there's a ghost there that's still there
that<00:02:04.040> represents<00:02:05.040> where<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.299> permanent

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that represents where the permanent

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.330 
that represents where the permanent
pivot<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:08.099> drawing<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:10.340> basically

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
pivot of that drawing is so basically

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.400 
pivot of that drawing is so basically
what<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.090> trying<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> indicate<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.050> me<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
what this is trying to indicate to me is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.700 
what this is trying to indicate to me is
that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.510 
that
if<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.460> some<00:02:14.490> reason<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:16.190> frame<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
if for some reason on this frame and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.330 
if for some reason on this frame and
this<00:02:17.790> frame<00:02:18.150> only<00:02:18.390> i<00:02:18.990> would<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.100> to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
this frame only i would like to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.840 
this frame only i would like to
temporarily<00:02:20.970> rotate<00:02:21.690> around<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:23.370> pivot<00:02:23.730> up

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
temporarily rotate around that pivot up

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.920 
temporarily rotate around that pivot up
there<00:02:24.210> i<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.100> i<00:02:26.250> deselect<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.330> select

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
there i can but if i deselect and select

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.380 
there i can but if i deselect and select
again<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.430> back<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.240> this

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
again it's going to go back to this

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
again it's going to go back to this
pivot<00:02:30.780> because<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> location<00:02:32.370> of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
pivot because this is the location of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
pivot because this is the location of
the<00:02:33.390> permanent<00:02:33.720> pivot<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.380> drawing

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the permanent pivot of that drawing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580 
the permanent pivot of that drawing
layer<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.330> i<00:02:36.420> guess<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.780> question<00:02:36.930> is

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
layer so then i guess the question is

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.030 
layer so then i guess the question is
you<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:38.490> would<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.850> be<00:02:39.090> useful<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.040> i

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you know when would this be useful and i

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.300 
you know when would this be useful and i
think<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> be<00:02:43.290> cautious<00:02:43.740> about

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
think that you want to be cautious about

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.040 
think that you want to be cautious about
using<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.780> kind<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:47.600> temporary<00:02:48.600> pivot

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
using that kind of temporary pivot

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.600 
using that kind of temporary pivot
manipulation<00:02:49.740> when<00:02:50.070> you're<00:02:50.220> doing<00:02:50.460> something

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
manipulation when you're doing something

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.120 
manipulation when you're doing something
like<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> cutout<00:02:51.240> character<00:02:51.810> because<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:53.010> know

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
like a cutout character because you know

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.950 
like a cutout character because you know
you<00:02:53.220> might<00:02:53.550> think<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.240> you're<00:02:54.540> rotating

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
you might think that you're rotating

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.650 
you might think that you're rotating
around<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.920> pivot<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.510> you're

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
around that pivot but all that you're

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.240 
around that pivot but all that you're
doing<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:58.410> you're<00:02:58.560> wrote<00:02:58.800> when<00:02:59.100> you're

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
doing when you're wrote when you're

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
doing when you're wrote when you're
moving<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.670> temporary<00:03:00.300> pivot<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.890> you're

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
moving this temporary pivot is you're

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.110 
moving this temporary pivot is you're
helping<00:03:02.310> yourself<00:03:02.900> visually<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:05.250> create

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
helping yourself visually to to create

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.060 
helping yourself visually to to create
the<00:03:06.300> next<00:03:06.540> position<00:03:07.020> where<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.620> going<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
the next position where this is going to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.020 
the next position where this is going to
exist<00:03:08.490> but<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.890> drawing<00:03:10.890> layer<00:03:11.160> internally

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
exist but this drawing layer internally

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.630 
exist but this drawing layer internally
its<00:03:12.330> pivot<00:03:12.960> point<00:03:12.990> is<00:03:13.350> still<00:03:13.590> defined<00:03:14.130> by<00:03:14.580> this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
its pivot point is still defined by this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.660 
its pivot point is still defined by this
area<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.720> what<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.830> try<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.370> is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
area so what it's going to try to do is

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.840 
area so what it's going to try to do is
calculate<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:19.200> transformations<00:03:20.160> necessary

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
calculate the transformations necessary

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.140 
calculate the transformations necessary
to<00:03:21.060> achieve<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.630> position<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:23.460> know<00:03:23.580> with

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
to achieve this position you know with

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.470 
to achieve this position you know with
this<00:03:24.420> permanent<00:03:25.260> pivot<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.910> hopefully<00:03:27.180> that

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
this permanent pivot so hopefully that

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.560 
this permanent pivot so hopefully that
wasn't<00:03:27.750> too<00:03:27.840> confusing<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:29.190> main<00:03:29.970> end<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
wasn't too confusing but the main end of

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.000 
wasn't too confusing but the main end of
the<00:03:30.660> story<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.740> you're<00:03:31.860> working

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the story is that when you're working

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.160 
the story is that when you're working
with<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.340> cutter<00:03:32.610> character<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.900> usually

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
with a cutter character you usually

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.590 
with a cutter character you usually
don't<00:03:34.680> want<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.130> use<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.340> temporary<00:03:36.270> pivot

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
don't want to use that temporary pivot

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.930 
don't want to use that temporary pivot
to<00:03:36.720> move<00:03:36.870> things<00:03:37.110> around<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:38.280> want<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.550> set

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
to move things around you want to set

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.600 
to move things around you want to set
the<00:03:39.140> permanent<00:03:40.140> pivots<00:03:40.470> set<00:03:41.220> them<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.430> your

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the permanent pivots set them on your

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.130 
the permanent pivots set them on your
drawings<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.150> promote<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.570> up<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> pegs

you're going to be an meeting with if

you're going to be an meeting with if
you<00:03:53.880> are<00:03:54.000> working<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.540> scenario<00:03:54.750> where<00:03:55.470> you

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
you are working in a scenario where you

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.420 
you are working in a scenario where you
know<00:03:56.340> you're<00:03:56.730> animating<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.500> don't<00:03:59.280> know

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
know you're animating like I don't know

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.040 
know you're animating like I don't know
you're<00:03:59.640> animating<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.240> cylindrical<00:04:00.600> tube

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
you're animating a cylindrical tube

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.200 
you're animating a cylindrical tube
around<00:04:01.260> or<00:04:01.620> something<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:02.040> you'd<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.490> to<00:04:02.550> on

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
around or something and you'd like to on

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.910 
around or something and you'd like to on
one<00:04:04.110> frame<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.520> know<00:04:05.780> define<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.680> place

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
one frame just you know define the place

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.230 
one frame just you know define the place
where<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.280> going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.430> go<00:04:08.490> so<00:04:08.760> let's<00:04:08.940> say

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
where it's going to go so let's say

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.510 
where it's going to go so let's say
let's<00:04:09.630> do<00:04:09.780> an<00:04:09.900> example<00:04:09.990> of<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:11.190> I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
let's do an example of this because I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.130 
let's do an example of this because I
think<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:12.180> little<00:04:12.480> bit<00:04:12.600> computing<00:04:12.960> so

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
think this is a little bit computing so

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.260 
think this is a little bit computing so
i'll<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.380> create<00:04:13.710> a<00:04:13.800> new<00:04:13.950> scene<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:15.120> know

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
i'll just create a new scene you know

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.500 
i'll just create a new scene you know
scene<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:17.030> doesn't<00:04:18.030> really<00:04:18.150> matter<00:04:18.330> what

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
scene and doesn't really matter what

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.550 
scene and doesn't really matter what
really<00:04:18.750> resolution<00:04:19.350> my<00:04:19.470> scene<00:04:19.830> is

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
really resolution my scene is

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.820 
really resolution my scene is
let<00:04:21.220> me<00:04:21.280> not<00:04:21.459> save<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:21.910> file<00:04:25.260> okay<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.320> let's

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
let me not save that file okay so let's

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.340 
let me not save that file okay so let's
just<00:04:27.100> take<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.639> rectangle<00:04:28.240> nothing<00:04:29.200> too

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
just take a rectangle nothing too

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.920 
just take a rectangle nothing too
exciting<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.820> will<00:04:31.060> fill<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:31.600> with<00:04:31.870> a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
exciting and I will fill it in with a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.620 
exciting and I will fill it in with a
color<00:04:34.080> light<00:04:35.669> ok<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:36.730> I've<00:04:36.940> got<00:04:37.090> my<00:04:37.120> root<00:04:37.450> my

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
color light ok so I've got my root my

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.230 
color light ok so I've got my root my
rectangle<00:04:38.230> here<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.620> i'll<00:04:39.310> set<00:04:39.669> my<00:04:39.700> pivot

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
rectangle here and i'll set my pivot

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.629 
rectangle here and i'll set my pivot
point<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.780> be<00:04:40.990> at<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.830> bottom<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.220> this<00:04:42.370> so

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
point to be at the bottom of this so

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.460 
point to be at the bottom of this so
maybe<00:04:43.180> most<00:04:43.450> of<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.660> time<00:04:43.840> I'm<00:04:44.139> moving<00:04:44.440> my

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
maybe most of the time I'm moving my

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.190 
maybe most of the time I'm moving my
rectangle<00:04:45.040> around<00:04:45.100> like<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:46.050> but<00:04:47.050> there

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
rectangle around like this but there

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.250 
rectangle around like this but there
might<00:04:47.410> be<00:04:47.440> one<00:04:47.889> case<00:04:48.730> or<00:04:49.000> one<00:04:49.150> scenario<00:04:49.480> where

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
might be one case or one scenario where

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.719 
might be one case or one scenario where
i<00:04:50.680> would<00:04:50.919> like<00:04:51.400> to<00:04:52.180> sort<00:04:52.389> of<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:54.100> know<00:04:54.130> rotate

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
i would like to sort of you know rotate

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.150 
i would like to sort of you know rotate
this<00:04:54.970> around<00:04:55.150> something<00:04:55.930> like<00:04:56.050> maybe<00:04:56.290> maybe

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
this around something like maybe maybe

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.830 
this around something like maybe maybe
this<00:04:57.550> is<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:58.389> plane<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.410> is<00:05:00.750> orbiting<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
this is a plane that is orbiting the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480 
this is a plane that is orbiting the
earth<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.260> earth<00:05:02.350> is<00:05:02.650> like<00:05:02.680> down<00:05:02.950> here<00:05:03.010> so

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
earth and the earth is like down here so

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.969 
earth and the earth is like down here so
if<00:05:03.790> i<00:05:03.910> drag<00:05:04.720> my<00:05:04.780> pivot<00:05:05.169> point<00:05:05.500> down<00:05:05.710> to<00:05:05.889> where

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
if i drag my pivot point down to where

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.590 
if i drag my pivot point down to where
the<00:05:06.100> center<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.550> earth<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.210> will<00:05:07.360> help

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the center of the earth is it will help

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.020 
the center of the earth is it will help
me<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:08.010> determine<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.100> next<00:05:09.250> position<00:05:09.639> of

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
me to determine the next position of

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.159 
me to determine the next position of
that<00:05:10.780> element<00:05:11.110> but<00:05:12.070> if<00:05:12.340> i<00:05:12.490> look<00:05:12.760> back<00:05:13.240> through

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
that element but if i look back through

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.060 
that element but if i look back through
that<00:05:15.510> animation<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:17.320> notice<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.740> the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
that animation you notice that the

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.290 
that animation you notice that the
animation<00:05:18.790> that<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:19.150> doing<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:19.930> not<00:05:20.260> exactly

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
animation that it's doing is not exactly

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.790 
animation that it's doing is not exactly
what<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.330> would<00:05:22.570> have<00:05:22.600> thought<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.290> would<00:05:23.470> do

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
what I would have thought it would do

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.520 
what I would have thought it would do
from<00:05:24.370> just<00:05:25.330> rotating<00:05:25.780> around<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.110> temporary

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
from just rotating around that temporary

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.380 
from just rotating around that temporary
pivot<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.550> reason<00:05:27.910> for<00:05:27.940> that<00:05:28.120> is<00:05:28.360> that

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
pivot and the reason for that is that

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.440 
pivot and the reason for that is that
the<00:05:28.720> pivot<00:05:29.110> internally<00:05:29.830> is<00:05:30.039> still<00:05:30.430> here<00:05:30.910> so

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
the pivot internally is still here so

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.140 
the pivot internally is still here so
what<00:05:31.690> it's<00:05:31.840> doing<00:05:32.289> is<00:05:32.500> it's<00:05:33.130> taking<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.910> as

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
what it's doing is it's taking this as

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.230 
what it's doing is it's taking this as
position<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.050> it's<00:05:35.770> taking<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.640> second

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
position a and it's taking the second

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.070 
position a and it's taking the second
position<00:05:37.390> as<00:05:37.870> position<00:05:38.830> be<00:05:39.039> and<00:05:39.340> it's<00:05:39.910> simply

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
position as position be and it's simply

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960 
position as position be and it's simply
calculating<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.770> shortest<00:05:42.610> distance

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
calculating the shortest distance

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.480 
calculating the shortest distance
between<00:05:43.030> those<00:05:43.479> two<00:05:43.690> points<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.680> really<00:05:45.220> if

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
between those two points so really if

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.820 
between those two points so really if
you<00:05:45.610> want<00:05:45.640> to<00:05:46.180> oops<00:05:46.870> sorry<00:05:47.229> if<00:05:47.440> you<00:05:47.560> want<00:05:47.740> to

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
you want to oops sorry if you want to

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.150 
you want to oops sorry if you want to
get<00:05:47.979> halfway<00:05:48.550> in<00:05:48.880> between<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.600> like<00:05:50.590> move<00:05:50.950> it

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
get halfway in between and like move it

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.050 
get halfway in between and like move it
up<00:05:51.310> you<00:05:51.940> can<00:05:52.150> adjust<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.919> do<00:05:54.100> what<00:05:54.970> you

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
up you can adjust it to to do what you

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.900 
up you can adjust it to to do what you
want<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.389> do<00:05:55.510> now<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:56.160> fairly<00:05:57.160> good<00:05:58.830> so

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
want it to do now it's fairly good so

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.460 
want it to do now it's fairly good so
hopefully<00:06:00.910> that<00:06:01.389> cleared<00:06:01.720> up<00:06:01.840> a<00:06:02.020> little<00:06:02.289> bit

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
hopefully that cleared up a little bit

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.620 
hopefully that cleared up a little bit
of<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:03.010> confusion<00:06:03.669> on<00:06:03.789> pivot<00:06:04.000> points<00:06:04.450> if

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
of the confusion on pivot points if

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.920 
of the confusion on pivot points if
you're<00:06:04.780> working<00:06:05.220> with<00:06:06.220> most<00:06:06.580> ninety<00:06:07.510> percent

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
you're working with most ninety percent

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.409 
you're working with most ninety percent
of<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.289> scenarios<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:09.310> would<00:06:09.490> want<00:06:09.729> not<00:06:10.150> to

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
of the scenarios you would want not to

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.960 
of the scenarios you would want not to
move<00:06:10.539> your<00:06:10.600> temporary<00:06:11.080> pivot<00:06:11.760> and<00:06:12.760> then

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
move your temporary pivot and then

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.670 
move your temporary pivot and then
hopefully<00:06:13.450> now<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:13.720> also<00:06:13.990> understand<00:06:14.470> how<00:06:14.620> to

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
hopefully now you also understand how to

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.860 
hopefully now you also understand how to
copy<00:06:14.979> and<00:06:15.220> paste<00:06:15.460> pivots<00:06:16.360> from<00:06:16.479> one<00:06:16.660> drawing

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
copy and paste pivots from one drawing

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.230 
copy and paste pivots from one drawing
to<00:06:17.050> another<00:06:17.260> and<00:06:17.729> if<00:06:18.729> you're<00:06:18.880> using<00:06:19.030> an

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
to another and if you're using an

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.750 
to another and if you're using an
approach<00:06:19.630> armony<00:06:20.110> then<00:06:20.410> you<00:06:20.919> know<00:06:21.370> how<00:06:21.700> to

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
approach armony then you know how to

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.920 
approach armony then you know how to
make<00:06:22.450> use<00:06:22.660> of<00:06:22.690> this<00:06:23.880> enable<00:06:24.880> drawing<00:06:25.479> pivot

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
make use of this enable drawing pivot

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.000
