00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.020
 Hi, I'm going to prepare a super recipe 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.299
 delicious very effective and very easy to 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.700
 to make is the crusty wholemeal bread with 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.770
 thyme for this recipe let's use 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.369
 one and three fourth traces of flour 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.869
 whole one tablespoon of fresh thyme 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.899
 what I did for the beans of 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.210
 thyme and pluck the leaves only 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.460
 until completing the spoonful too 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.680
 I have a teaspoon of powder 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.399
 Bake three quarts of teaspoon 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.790
 salt I have also half a cup of water and 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.860
 a third cup of vegetable oil in 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.390
 this case I am using olive oil and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.520
 this super nutritious recipe because 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.860
 we are only using integral encouragement 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.960
 and whole grain fiber-rich flour in 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.090
 B-complex vitamins in manganese 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.120
 false albert that we're going to make it 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.530
 hot baked at high temperature is 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.750
 say 450 degrees fahrenheit or 233 degrees 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.560
 centigrade in a container we add 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.760
 the integrated ones we will add the thyme the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.480
 tsp 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.480
 baking powder 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:21.500
 and three quarts of a teaspoon of salt 12 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.950
 this teaspoon is a quarter of 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.750
 teaspoonful 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 let's mix everything very well with a 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.119
 spoon seven sticks a little better when 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.990
 we mix all let's add the water 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.990
 and the oil 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.189
 it is good to add to that water 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.620
 and the oil 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.770
 and let's mix gently 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.359
 or once we have all the 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.170
 well integrated ingredients I love you 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.530
 show like this 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.229
 the following we are going to do only 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.229
 of 3 4 times no more good 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 one 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.630
 and with the help of a knife we â€‹â€‹are going to 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.630
 cut the dough into three parts 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.810
 once we have cut the dough in 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.050
 three we grab the first the first 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.230
 little bit of dough we put it on a 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.510
 siliconized paper this paper is the one that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.910
 can take to the oven what can they look for 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.280
 in the supermarket the paper that one uses 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.050
 to bake cookies any paper 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.730
 that can be taken to the oven is not the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.540
 waxed paper that paper serves us 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 so good here we put the mass in 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.910
 this paper and with the help of the roller 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.910
 let's extend the dough 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 very well 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.710
 and the thickness should be well insulated maximum 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.290
 about 3 millimeters thick good here 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.390
 I already have the dough and I extended it to 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.280
 I want to show no matter how the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.410
 what is this has been done by hand does not have 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.600
 to be perfect I want to show you the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.580
 face being thin the paper 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.709
 help that does not stick and like 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.170
 you can see the thyme leaves you see 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.710
 beautiful, we have the three masses 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.840
 extended I want to show you 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.720
 The next step is to add a 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.810
 little olive oil on top I'll 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.810
 use 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.879
 A little bit, yes 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.099
 If I had a skewer to ask 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.849
 to the dough with the oil but I do not have 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.849
 then a sun 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.340
 a teaspoon and I do this 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.340
 accept that on the good surface 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.440
 I will do the same with the other two 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.310
 very well since here at the head of the oil 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.959
 olive in the three more water our 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.290
 bread and now with the knife we â€‹â€‹are going to 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.290
 cut 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.280
 this is like doing this because more 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.230
 easy after loosening the bread too 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.880
 they can take it to the razzies only 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.340
 when it is ready they want it but I 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.919
 like it more this way 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.889
 you can find the way that most 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.330
 like 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.659
 these can do also like 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.659
 squares 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.080
 and such a post 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.889
 once we have given it the form that 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.349
 we want our bread for our bread 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.870
 we are going to place it in a container 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.870
 cookies or it can also be a spray 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.300
 and let's forget for 10 minutes very 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.550
 well here we have our inner bread and 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.950
 crunchy with thyme ready to 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.930
 savor you have to let it cool down 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.169
 bit 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.150
 I go to the afternoon 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.689
 I want to show you this is a little 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.689
 hot 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.820
 the consistency is crispy this bread 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.000

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.479
