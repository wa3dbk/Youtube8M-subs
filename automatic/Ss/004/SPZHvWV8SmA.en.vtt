00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:08.340
 I have to force myself sorry but if not 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 I shoot the wrong radio if I don't 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.609
 I shoot this flash in the face of a priest 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the ghost version 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.960
 then they will look for your notes 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 university, however, bound points i 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 mine have been well exploited because i 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 Use sheets for as card from 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.730
 to recycle 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.770
 always to print or use ad 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 example I used to see images 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.200
 trace or for scores for i 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.350
 table games 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.570
 then the cover kept it because 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.450
 you never know it could be used for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 create shape stencils or steaks 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.449
 not video of alice in the mirror ee 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.180
 then finally there is this is the part where 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 the plastic part is inserted 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.909
 where they are inserted 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 the sheets sometimes I had no idea 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 what to do with it sincerely then 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 preserved were a month or so on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 desk and then I realized how to do it 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.409
 use 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.030
 I have to make a small premise I had 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 already proposed quite an idea 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.060
 cheap to fix the necklaces though 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 I have to be honest in case you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.080
 you didn't see what you lost anything 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.619
 the cutting board with a chopping board 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.470
 of 70 cents with nails to which 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.570
 then I learned the necklaces though 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 still being a small chopping board not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 having a 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.549
 it is a great availability of space and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.030
 having little and necklaces and surpasses it 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.850
 loaded therefore not even very easy 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.369
 keep the necklaces in order o 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.920
 however they don't have everything is visible and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.440
 so I decided to find one 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.530
 different solution and I have to be honest 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.500
 now i 'm sure it will be there 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.560
 final solution also because with 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 this proposal he does to make you can 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 put the only solution if you don't 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.290
 has a wide range of products 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.220
 of earrings of necklaces of rings also 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.260
 of bracelets after enclose everything in 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
 both jewelry is few but good 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 in this the only solution if instead 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.720
 the numerous forced ones will only be enough 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.890
 for the necklaces I'll show you the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.300
 my proposal 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.300
 being closed rings is 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.900
 even easy to insert or use 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.600
 as aesthetically exhibiting rings 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.549
 they are not beautiful and for this reason 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:58.560
 I tried to do this wait 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:03:01.140
 a little can always 18 recycling to mine 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.230
 once a panel of a piece of furniture I have 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.230
 threw 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.390
 and that however instead or the upper part 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.819
 I thought it could be me want 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.080
 say in fact I was not wrong 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:18.080
 I was showing then this is the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 ten of all the pen is not seen 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.900
 earrings the pen can be hang 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.770
 earrings and pendants necklaces etc. for 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.090
 camouflage the ugly aspect of these 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.489
 of the rings 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.890
 I therefore used this panel of 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.890
 based on which I glued with the attk 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.910
 the plastic rings and I made one 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.519
 white frame to be able to camouflage a little 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:57.510
 the ugly look of the rings 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:04:03.420
 as you can see I try as you see the necklaces 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.819
 are come the necklaces are arranged 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.540
 they are put separately 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.489
 so I'm more 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.599
 evident with respect to the solution of 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:17.019
 before and in addition you can also put the 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.320
 rings you can put the pins you can 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.370
 put the rights not even days 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.419
 Volandri 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:34.300
 oh well then in reality there is not 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:41.320
 chubby better then then hang the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:44.199
 pins and like that of matera are 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.699
 no video at all because there wasn't a 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.669
 much to do to show 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.690
 simply used a panel is 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:56.129
 a panel of 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.469
 very thin plywood with 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.259
 simple but gets there glued with the 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.539
 pac is a white frame for resuming 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.239
 the white of the rings 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.499
 just finished your exhibitors is 

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.739
 actually finished this could also 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:12.440
 be used for example for 

00:05:09.739 --> 00:05:17.099
 exhibit in markets 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.550
 anything is very very practical not 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.550
 I would have never believed 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.129
 but a common feeling for itself 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.780
 nothing practically leaves you now 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.810
 peace 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.220
 now I'm a bit exaggerated a possible 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.220
 release in peace to the next
