00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
in four different models we this is the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.019 
in four different models we this is the

or by ways full of when you go to arrive

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.790 
or by ways full of when you go to arrive
basically<00:00:49.579> pop<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.059> end<00:00:50.210> cap<00:00:50.480> off<00:00:50.719> fill<00:00:51.679> it

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
basically pop the end cap off fill it

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.590 
basically pop the end cap off fill it
full<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.039> rock<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.640> then<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.879> total<00:00:53.420> weight

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
full of rock and then the total weight

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.809 
full of rock and then the total weight
will<00:00:53.629> be<00:00:54.019> about<00:00:54.260> 70<00:00:54.769> pounds<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.579> need<00:00:55.730> to

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
will be about 70 pounds so you need to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.419 
will be about 70 pounds so you need to
keep<00:00:55.999> that<00:00:56.179> into<00:00:56.480> consideration<00:00:57.190> when<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.280> go

keep that into consideration when you go

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.950 
keep that into consideration when you go
to<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.730> six<00:00:59.030> footer<00:00:59.269> because<00:00:59.569> then<00:00:59.780> you'll<00:00:59.929> be

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
to the six footer because then you'll be

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.270 
to the six footer because then you'll be
pushing<00:01:00.260> around<00:01:00.949> 105<00:01:01.879> 110<00:01:02.510> pounds<00:01:03.140> total<00:01:03.440> now

pushing around 105 110 pounds total now

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.310 
pushing around 105 110 pounds total now
basically<00:01:04.580> what<00:01:05.000> it<00:01:05.120> is<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:05.540> it's<00:01:05.990> got<00:01:06.140> these

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
basically what it is is it's got these

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.770 
basically what it is is it's got these
spikes<00:01:06.770> they're<00:01:07.460> located<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.240> bottom<00:01:08.420> as

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
spikes they're located on the bottom as

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.620 
spikes they're located on the bottom as
you<00:01:09.140> pull<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.730> you<00:01:10.730> can<00:01:11.030> look<00:01:11.150> at<00:01:11.360> it<00:01:11.480> really

you pull and you can look at it really
two<00:01:11.900> different<00:01:12.200> ways<00:01:12.380> one<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.740> these<00:01:13.070> spikes

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
two different ways one is these spikes

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.960 
two different ways one is these spikes
will<00:01:13.760> penetrate<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.600> remove<00:01:15.410> root<00:01:15.770> or<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
will penetrate and remove root or the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.490 
will penetrate and remove root or the
other<00:01:17.090> way<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.300> look<00:01:17.480> at<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.930> simply<00:01:18.470> just

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
other way to look at it is simply just

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.760

we use

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.069 
we use
it<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> rate<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.119> it'll<00:01:21.420> hook<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> weeds

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
it as a rate where it'll hook the weeds

weighs<00:01:46.920> about<00:01:47.069> 70<00:01:47.549> pounds<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.329> comes<00:01:48.569> with

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
weighs about 70 pounds it comes with

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.460 
weighs about 70 pounds it comes with
this<00:01:48.959> Bridal<00:01:49.500> rope<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.240> pull<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
this Bridal rope and so as I pull it you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.309 
this Bridal rope and so as I pull it you
can<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> action<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.140> goes

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
can see the action that it just goes

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.060 
can see the action that it just goes
across<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:56.009> bottom

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.899 

my<00:02:01.070> perspective<00:02:02.500> effort<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.770> required<00:02:03.950> this

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
my perspective effort is required this

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.280 
my perspective effort is required this
really

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
really

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.749 
really
just<00:02:08.290> goes<00:02:08.470> across<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.920> bottom<00:02:09.070> when<00:02:09.430> I<00:02:09.460> get

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
just goes across the bottom when I get

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
just goes across the bottom when I get
to<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.030> end<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.270> my<00:02:10.360> path<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.990> could<00:02:11.410> either

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
to the end of my path I could either

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.199 
to the end of my path I could either
turn<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.700> it'll<00:02:13.210> easily

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
turn and it'll easily

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.720 
turn and it'll easily
in<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> direction<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.379> or<00:02:16.159> I<00:02:16.459> could

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
in the direction that I go or I could

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
in the direction that I go or I could
simply<00:02:16.939> bring<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:17.450> bridled<00:02:17.930> rope<00:02:18.140> back<00:02:18.709> over

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
simply bring the bridled rope back over

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.940 
simply bring the bridled rope back over
here<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.700> very<00:02:22.700> minimal<00:02:22.939> effort<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.629> required

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
here and very minimal effort is required

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.780 
here and very minimal effort is required
to<00:02:24.950> pull<00:02:25.159> it<00:02:25.280> across<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.760> bottom

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.119 

and<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.230> effort<00:02:31.560> ends<00:02:32.010> up

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
and you can see that the effort ends up

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.390 
and you can see that the effort ends up
producing<00:02:32.610> quite<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> good<00:02:33.269> result<00:02:33.599> as<00:02:33.810> far<00:02:34.049> as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
producing quite a good result as far as

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.820 
producing quite a good result as far as
moving<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.430> self<00:02:35.790> moving<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.840> muck<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.230> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
moving the self moving the muck and then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.180 
moving the self moving the muck and then
also<00:02:38.069> tearing<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.879> leaves<00:02:39.090> should<00:02:40.190> also

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
also tearing up the leaves should also

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.910 
also tearing up the leaves should also
say<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.720> if<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.080> are<00:02:43.290> some<00:02:43.590> state

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
say that if there are some state

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.759 
say that if there are some state
requirements<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.930> as<00:02:45.930> recently<00:02:46.620> as

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
requirements with this as recently as

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.280 
requirements with this as recently as
just<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.700> past<00:02:48.000> week<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.900> state<00:02:49.200> of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
just in this past week the state of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.020 
just in this past week the state of
Wisconsin<00:02:49.890> has<00:02:50.069> determined<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.879> be<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
Wisconsin has determined this to be a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.199 
Wisconsin has determined this to be a
threat<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.319> might<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:54.060> might

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
threat now that might that might

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.059 
threat now that might that might
interest<00:02:54.599> some<00:02:54.930> potential<00:02:55.500> buyers<00:02:55.739> because

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
interest some potential buyers because

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
interest some potential buyers because
they<00:02:56.340> realize<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.480> effective

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
they realize that it is very effective

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.440 
they realize that it is very effective
and<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.620> considered<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.129> be<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.610> dredging

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
and actually considered to be a dredging

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.900 
and actually considered to be a dredging
tool<00:03:01.040> while<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.250> other<00:03:02.400> people<00:03:02.760> that

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
tool while there's other people that

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.309 
tool while there's other people that
might<00:03:03.120> be<00:03:03.180> concerned<00:03:03.629> because<00:03:03.840> they<00:03:04.140> don't

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
might be concerned because they don't

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.990 
might be concerned because they don't
want<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.650> tear<00:03:04.829> things<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.280> too<00:03:05.459> much<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:05.849> that

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
want to tear things up too much so that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.610 
want to tear things up too much so that
is<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> consideration<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.079> should<00:03:07.440> take

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
is a consideration that you should take

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.869 
is a consideration that you should take
into<00:03:07.910> consideration<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:10.140> as<00:03:11.010> always<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.670> think

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
into consideration and as always I think

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.729 
into consideration and as always I think
it<00:03:12.000> really<00:03:12.150> needs<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.840> stated<00:03:13.349> that<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.590> is

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
it really needs to be stated that it is

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.349 
it really needs to be stated that it is
your<00:03:13.950> responsibility<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.700> check<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.209> your

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
your responsibility to check with your

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.160 
your responsibility to check with your
state<00:03:15.420> local<00:03:17.510> authorities<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.540> determine

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
state local authorities to determine

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
state local authorities to determine
what<00:03:19.349> actually<00:03:19.890> against<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.519> best<00:03:20.730> tools<00:03:21.030> to

what actually against the best tools to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.420 
what actually against the best tools to
use<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.420> what<00:03:21.810> shouldn't<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.319> used<00:03:22.500> in
