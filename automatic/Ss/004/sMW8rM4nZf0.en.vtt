 travel images of the minister of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 We talk about transportation 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 Florencio Randazo who was in China and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 just visiting the plant where 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.269
 they manufacture the pellets that were 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 bought to bring Argentina and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 to renew the values ​​that there are up to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 the time in three thousand three 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 food and clothes 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 [Music] 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.290
 the trains that we are going to have from 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.119
 2014 in Argentina to you for 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.070
 decide if they like it or do not like it 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.300
 we are in one of the wagons inside 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.990
 this is going to be the place for 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.489
 bikes 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.340
 look good on the other hand also here what 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.230
 that we have is the famous railings of the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 people will be able to drink and hang 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.860
 any of the elements 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.890
 mainly because it is having 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.309
 welcome from work there is no 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 least you do not notice the grill that 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.050
 you know and that many times 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.050
 used to put the bags up 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.239
 this does not have the new trains 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.540
 let's see the seats well the 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.870
 accents are really 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:12.260
 as two are small but comfortable and 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.410
 as you can see from the upholstery 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.490
 until its conformation the way in which 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.050
 they are made and others obviously 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.740
 one can realize that it is 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.770
 of a technological renovation in all 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
 the senses and aesthetics really very 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.940
 but very important because the aesthetic 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.040
 is also present in the construction 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.020
 of the new trains we see a little more to 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.340
 see from here you will surely when 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 come back to your house you are going to have to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.890
 take not the handrail because the trains 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.500
 they will continue to be with a lot of people 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.630
 that is, greater stress or better trains 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 will not prevent the amount of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.410
 users decrease very much on the contrary 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 the bet is precisely what does each 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.870
 more people who use transport 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 railway 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.580
 taking into account it's good that it shortens 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.740
 distances and that besides that is a lot 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 cleaner in every way good 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.729
 these are the new trains are the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.890
 We are showing by c5n we are in 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.800
 china and we are in one of the cities 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.870
 most important in this country 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.390
 of all this we are in the company of 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.720
 China's largest trains and more 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.750
 important china that is called csr and 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.970
 I'm sure we'll be here soon 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.610
 showing him many other things more than 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.840
 they have to do with trains and in addition 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.840
 with Chinese culture
