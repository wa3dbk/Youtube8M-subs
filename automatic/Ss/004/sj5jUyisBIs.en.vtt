00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
a bit of a cliche I know but you know

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.729 
a bit of a cliche I know but you know
it's<00:00:46.579> quite<00:00:46.730> fun<00:00:46.910> of<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.120> recognizable<00:00:47.930> it's

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
it's quite fun of a recognizable it's

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.200 
it's quite fun of a recognizable it's
actually<00:00:49.040> quite<00:00:49.220> tricky<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.640> play<00:00:49.820> on<00:00:50.089> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
actually quite tricky to play on the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.540 
actually quite tricky to play on the
piano<00:00:50.420> not<00:00:50.900> horrendously<00:00:51.530> difficult<00:00:51.650> but<00:00:52.519> a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
piano not horrendously difficult but a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.569 
piano not horrendously difficult but a
little<00:00:52.850> bit<00:00:53.000> tricky<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:55.430> actually

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
little bit tricky and it actually

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.810 
little bit tricky and it actually
started<00:00:56.059> life<00:00:56.239> as<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:57.559> guitar<00:00:58.040> turn<00:00:58.250> around<00:00:58.579> and

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
started life as a guitar turn around and

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.759 
started life as a guitar turn around and
on<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.000> guitar<00:00:59.510> it's<00:00:59.750> really<00:00:59.839> easy<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.680> play

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
on the guitar it's really easy to play

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.040 
on the guitar it's really easy to play
just<00:01:01.129> slide<00:01:01.550> up<00:01:01.729> a<00:01:01.820> couple<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.210> parallel

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
just slide up a couple of parallel

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.960 
just slide up a couple of parallel
strings<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:03.649> you<00:01:03.829> know<00:01:03.949> slide<00:01:04.610> down<00:01:04.850> the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
strings and you know slide down the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.680 
strings and you know slide down the
alternating<00:01:06.880> but<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.090> piano<00:01:08.300> it's<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.539> bit

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
alternating but on the piano it's a bit

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.180 
alternating but on the piano it's a bit
trickier<00:01:09.140> mostly<00:01:09.530> because<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.830> notes<00:01:10.009> are<00:01:10.130> so

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
trickier mostly because the notes are so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.529 
trickier mostly because the notes are so
far<00:01:10.550> apart<00:01:10.990> looking<00:01:11.990> at<00:01:12.110> any<00:01:12.289> flat<00:01:12.590> here<00:01:13.539> let

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
far apart looking at any flat here let

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.910 
far apart looking at any flat here let
me<00:01:14.630> slow<00:01:14.899> it<00:01:15.020> down

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
get that fingering right although it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
get that fingering right although it
varies<00:01:59.729> from<00:02:00.360> key<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> key<00:02:00.780> key<00:02:00.990> depends<00:02:01.650> on

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
varies from key to key key depends on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
varies from key to key key depends on
the<00:02:01.830> position<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.250> black<00:02:02.400> notes<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:07.080> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the position of the black notes you can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.480 
the position of the black notes you can
do<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:07.680> jumping<00:02:09.890> yeah<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:10.950> depends<00:02:11.280> how

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
do it by jumping yeah it depends how

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.710 
do it by jumping yeah it depends how
you're<00:02:11.640> playing<00:02:11.850> if<00:02:11.970> you're<00:02:12.060> playing<00:02:12.300> really

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you're playing if you're playing really

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:22.070 
you're playing if you're playing really
spiky<00:02:13.470> AG<00:02:13.620> bills<00:02:20.600> but<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.990> be

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the fingering right

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.720 
the fingering right
another<00:02:28.590> way<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.709> doing<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.190> again<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
another way of doing it again if you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
can't quite get the fingerings use your

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.630 
can't quite get the fingerings use your
pedal<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:36.830> okay<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.160> have<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.459> make<00:02:38.610> sure

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
pedal but okay but you have to make sure

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.930 
pedal but okay but you have to make sure
that<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.480> pedal<00:02:40.520> between<00:02:41.520> each<00:02:41.670> set<00:02:41.910> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
that your pedal between each set of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.740 
that your pedal between each set of
notes<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.330> will<00:02:42.600> end<00:02:42.690> up<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:44.540> nicely<00:02:45.540> mush

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
notes I will end up with nicely mush

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.400 
notes I will end up with nicely mush

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:42.580 
we go one way you can make it quite
interesting<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.760> by<00:03:35.090> using<00:03:35.390> crush<00:03:35.750> notes<00:03:41.590> okay

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
interesting is by using crush notes okay

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.020 
interesting is by using crush notes okay
but<00:03:42.740> then<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.340> start<00:03:43.790> thinking

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
but then you have to start thinking

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.340 
but then you have to start thinking
about<00:03:44.270> using<00:03:44.480> your<00:03:44.720> pedal<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.050> stick<00:03:45.230> it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
about using your pedal to stick it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.720 
about using your pedal to stick it
together<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.130> does<00:03:46.250> give<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.580> little

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
together but it does give it a little

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
together but it does give it a little
bit<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.030> them<00:03:51.670> okay<00:03:52.670> just<00:03:53.150> go<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.270> little<00:03:53.360> bit<00:03:53.660> of

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
bit of them okay just go a little bit of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.180 
bit of them okay just go a little bit of
character<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.290> just<00:03:54.470> need<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.800> need<00:03:55.100> to

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
character you just need that need to

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.160 
character you just need that need to
practice<00:03:55.520> it<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> little<00:03:55.940> bit<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.660> that's<00:03:57.020> all

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
practice it a little bit and that's all

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.720 
practice it a little bit and that's all
there<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:58.040> play<00:03:58.220> around<00:03:58.430> with<00:03:58.610> it

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
there is to it just play around with it

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.790 
there is to it just play around with it
in<00:03:58.850> different<00:03:58.880> keys<00:04:02.230> yeah<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.440> try<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
in different keys yeah and try and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.380 
in different keys yeah and try and
incorporate<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.550> into<00:04:04.670> your<00:04:04.790> blues<00:04:05.090> playing

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
now and then just as a turnaround it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.610 
now and then just as a turnaround it
also<00:04:07.970> it's<00:04:08.390> quite<00:04:08.690> good<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:09.020> finishing<00:04:09.290> songs

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
