 resources in 3d chess and quests today 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.420
 all-round database of the world 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.059
 chess we are talking about the site e 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.140
 you probably already know chase games 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 dot.com reward this is a database 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.100
 huge number of games that can be bis 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.020
 by anyone commented by anyone in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 so that everyone can participate in 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
 match discussions 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.970
 ok let's say there are on this site 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.530
 two basic things 1 to the database of 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 matches and another is a database of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.420
 openings then we start to database of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 start here you see right in the home 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 page there is a search form 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
 together you are interested in a standard 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.440
 particular player enter here the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.750
 name otherwise there is also a form more 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.800
 in-depth for the research in which one 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.319
 can choose who the player has 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.350
 my future opponent by the number of 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.690
 moves of the game what kind of opening 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.950
 played has given but of fashion to filter 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.229
 more research then ad 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.039
 example that I know we have to look for 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:57.590
 lasker party and here they are all 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:57.590
 many pages will be ordered 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 let's take we are the last page 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.550
 last game the scame played 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.970
 944 marshall and here are all the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.410
 moves you can scroll the game like a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.840
 any other game browser 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.050
 instead written that a 1940 performance 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.060
 the opening and then the final result then 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.980
 below are all the comments 16 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.220
 you have also been raised 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.110
 participate in the creation of these new ones 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.980
 comments 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.600
 the other thing you can see this 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.430
 point is the openings an example if you 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.290
 you don't know 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:03:01.739
 an opening that begins with e 45 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:08.970
 horses mares f3 endorsement f6 digit 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:11.190
 here you give up research and it came out and me 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.330
 45 who didn't take the rest anyway 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:21.160
 not being able to define to search here therefore 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:24.670
 horse f3 grasshoppers 6 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.760
 and see if you are there 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.360
 ok the names that this opening takes 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.160
 are the most variants for 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.380
 of fans that would be the Russian defense yes 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.940
 it can also fall according to some 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.590
 particular combinations of moves 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.040
 successive in other openings as from 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 four horses playing piano etc. 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.350
 and here as we have seen a little in the case 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.250
 says opening spunto org for every move 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.739
 next one 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.069
 in this case it says the White 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.350
 property b but the quantity is written 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.330
 as a percentage of the matches with that 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.640
 move from white and draw them 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.180
 those won by black cannot be 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.360
 regular not born a move you bring 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.860
 often the suit is this case of white 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.430
 people for example this even if little 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.950
 played maybe it would be better to rely on 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.080
 those are more played for one of the parts 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.539
 of the database are higher for example 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.120
 of 41 click here automatically yes 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:34.490
 move to the next move 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.380
 same thing for black here now the move 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.570
 it is the third of the black one can choose 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.900
 etc 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.490
 there are some fundamental matches 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.840
 you can play with this opening 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.690
 find it here so you can too 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.669
 deepen your research or gone 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.490
 serious of the parties playing with champions 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.570
 so let's try to watch this game 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:00.470
 between went launch in 1996 which ended with 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.530
 Anand's victory is everyone's comment 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.320
 lexical that the chessboard theme we see 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.800
 that the first three moves are really 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.720
 the ones we posted 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.080
 another thing we can see here at 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.420
 example click on the player's name 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.700
 and opens with a player card 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.360
 same 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.220
 we see that there are types of ivanciuc 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.190
 3.113 matches in the database are his 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:34.640
 from 1984 to 2013 and then various data are the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.200
 victories draws defeats cl 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.350
 the most interesting openings 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.630
 play we see that with the white pieces 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.070
 nor understood to play the game more often 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:52.880
 Sicilian with the Spanish these would be 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:55.850
 these Indian Slavic and Spanish French 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.160
 unfortunately purposely closed names here 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.600
 I am in English but little can be done e 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.520
 this is the most played opening 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.220
 so with neri prices , so let's say 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.050
 ivanciuc seems to be a lover of 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.910
 Sicilian all the sauces or below 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.530
 are a series of the most beautiful matches 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:16.670
 who played any matches 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.720
 world championships never arrived 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.020
 a final but 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:26.290
 always of eliminatory and then come back in 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:30.340
 which he performed very well on 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.020
 in fact here, for example, the anatoli trophy 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.080
 The ruler 's karpov can click on it 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.870
 and there are all the matches gone well 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.270
 play in this tournament 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.400
 so let's say it's just a site 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.940
 complete among other things here even better 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.370
 of tournament results won ivanciuc 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.590
 equal with karpov though 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.560
 probably had a score of 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.140
 best playoff so ok here too 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.780
 you will have much to do to visit it all 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:02.340
 so I greet you and wish you good 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.340
 fun and good matches
