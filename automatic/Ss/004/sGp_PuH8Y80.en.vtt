okay so here's another tutorial you all
know<00:00:05.609> how<00:00:05.759> much<00:00:05.879> we<00:00:06.000> left<00:00:06.180> tutorials<00:00:07.099> this<00:00:08.099> is

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
know how much we left tutorials this is

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.049 
know how much we left tutorials this is
not<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:10.280> last<00:00:11.280> tutorial<00:00:11.429> taught<00:00:11.849> us<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
not it last tutorial taught us how to

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.060 
not it last tutorial taught us how to
switch<00:00:12.330> animations<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> thought<00:00:13.950> it

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
switch animations so I thought it

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
switch animations so I thought it
fitting<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.549> if<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> switch<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.299> animation

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
fitting that if you switch an animation

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.050 
fitting that if you switch an animation
with<00:00:15.929> something<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.060> has<00:00:19.039> no

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
with something and what if it has no

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.290 
with something and what if it has no
attacks<00:00:21.060> or<00:00:21.359> doesn't<00:00:21.660> interact<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.230> someone

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
attacks or doesn't interact with someone

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
attacks or doesn't interact with someone
I'll<00:00:24.300> explain<00:00:24.600> more<00:00:24.750> what<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> mean<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I'll explain more what I mean in a

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.519 
I'll explain more what I mean in a
second<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.519> ahead<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.849> open<00:00:26.910> smash<00:00:27.300> attacks

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.700 

minimize<00:00:31.529> everything<00:00:31.820> keep<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> tidy<00:00:33.710> this

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
minimize everything keep it tidy this

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.360 
minimize everything keep it tidy this
time<00:00:34.980> let's<00:00:35.309> open<00:00:35.850> file<00:00:36.360> open<00:00:38.000> let's<00:00:39.000> open<00:00:39.450> up

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
time let's open file open let's open up

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
time let's open file open let's open up
find<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:47.390> let's<00:00:48.390> open<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.050> Marv<00:00:51.649> go<00:00:52.649> ahead

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
find them let's open up Marv go ahead

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.869 
find them let's open up Marv go ahead
and<00:00:53.010> find<00:00:53.190> Marv<00:00:53.550> back<00:00:54.559> wherever<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.070> him

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and find Marv back wherever you have him

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
and find Marv back wherever you have him
store<00:00:59.090> ok<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:01.730> let's<00:01:02.730> say<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.350> Mars<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
store ok so let's say you have Mars and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.899 
store ok so let's say you have Mars and
you<00:01:05.850> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> switch<00:01:08.510> an<00:01:09.510> attack<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.729> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you want to switch an attack with one of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.630 
you want to switch an attack with one of
his<00:01:12.180> many<00:01:12.960> taunts<00:01:13.500> which<00:01:13.979> involved<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
his many taunts which involved in

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.260 
his many taunts which involved in
swinging<00:01:14.909> his<00:01:15.180> sword<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.090> know

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
swinging his sword but as we all know

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
swinging his sword but as we all know
taunts<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.470> no<00:01:19.740> damage<00:01:24.259> right<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> there's<00:01:28.590> one

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
taunts do no damage right so there's one

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
taunts do no damage right so there's one
of<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:28.890> things<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:30.450> be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
of two things you can do you can be

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020 
of two things you can do you can be
super<00:01:31.020> awesome<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.710> design<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.610> own<00:01:32.640> hit

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
super awesome and design your own hit

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.770 
super awesome and design your own hit
boxes<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> damages<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.540> along<00:01:36.630> with

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
boxes and the damages that go along with

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
boxes and the damages that go along with
them<00:01:37.280> or<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:41.090> something<00:01:42.090> pretty

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
them or you can do something pretty

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:52.580 
them or you can do something pretty
simple<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:48.170> copy<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.470> it's<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
simple and just copy it and it's it's a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.090 
simple and just copy it and it's it's a
basic<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.540> looks<00:01:54.750> cool<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:58.100> believe

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
basic thing and it looks cool I believe

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.859 
basic thing and it looks cool I believe
attack<00:01:59.670> l<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.869> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
attack l that was for is down a so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
attack l that was for is down a so
that's<00:02:03.990> number<00:02:04.079> 60<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.680> Mars<00:02:04.890> every<00:02:05.729> character

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that's number 60 on Mars every character

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.350 
that's number 60 on Mars every character
is<00:02:06.090> different<00:02:06.890> what<00:02:07.890> you're<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:09.890> is

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
is different what you're going to do is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.970 
is different what you're going to do is
really<00:02:12.360> two<00:02:13.200> things<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.709> do

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
really two things you can do

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.059 
really two things you can do
one<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.879> copied<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.330> animation<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.409> top

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
one is just copied the animation on top

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.880 
one is just copied the animation on top
of<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> things<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
of this and one of the things that is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680 
of this and one of the things that is
really<00:02:20.129> tricky<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.909> get<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
really tricky when you get into this is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.570 
really tricky when you get into this is
knowing<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:22.230> use<00:02:22.409> event<00:02:22.739> list<00:02:22.950> our<00:02:23.159> main<00:02:23.970> is

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
knowing what use event list our main is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.729 
knowing what use event list our main is
what<00:02:26.580> does<00:02:26.819> damage<00:02:27.150> what<00:02:27.750> part<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> your<00:02:28.440> body

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
what does damage what part of your body

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.430 
what does damage what part of your body
the<00:02:29.670> sword<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> hits<00:02:30.690> how<00:02:30.900> much<00:02:30.959> damage<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the sword if it hits how much damage it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.039 
the sword if it hits how much damage it
does<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.700> stuff<00:02:33.049> offensive

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
does it's all this stuff offensive

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.640 
does it's all this stuff offensive
collision<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.970> important<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.450> know

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
collision it's important to know

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.600 
collision it's important to know
terminate<00:02:37.650> collisions<00:02:37.980> comes<00:02:38.160> after<00:02:38.489> that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
terminate collisions comes after that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.180 
terminate collisions comes after that
means<00:02:38.790> stop<00:02:39.209> doing<00:02:39.599> those<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.829> mark<00:02:40.980> does

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
means stop doing those so in mark does

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.979 
means stop doing those so in mark does
down<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> kind<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> like<00:02:42.180> slashes<00:02:42.599> in<00:02:42.629> front

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
down a kind of like slashes in front

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.289 
down a kind of like slashes in front
slashes<00:02:43.590> behind<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.790> slashing<00:02:45.090> in

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
slashes behind so this is slashing in

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.920 
slashes behind so this is slashing in
front<00:02:45.540> up<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.349> stops<00:02:47.870> slashing<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
front up here then it stops slashing a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.220 
front up here then it stops slashing a
friend<00:02:49.700> then<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.910> backslash<00:02:51.360> these<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
friend then the backslash these are the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.819 
friend then the backslash these are the
damages<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.799> does<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:55.470> actually<00:02:55.530> look

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
damages it does so they actually look

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.490 
damages it does so they actually look
the<00:02:55.920> ids<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.519> same<00:02:56.730> ID<00:02:56.910> 0<00:02:57.269> 1<00:02:57.510> 2<00:02:57.720> 3<00:02:57.920> okay<00:02:58.920> so

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
the ids are the same ID 0 1 2 3 okay so

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.289 
the ids are the same ID 0 1 2 3 okay so
since<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.920> go<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.329> 1c0<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:05.310> notice<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:06.269> has

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
since if you go to 1c0 and notice it has

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.030 
since if you go to 1c0 and notice it has
not<00:03:06.629> nothing<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.170> Maine<00:03:07.349> which<00:03:07.620> means<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.920> does

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
not nothing in Maine which means it does

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.979 
not nothing in Maine which means it does
no<00:03:08.190> damage<00:03:08.359> there's<00:03:09.359> two<00:03:09.480> things<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.720> can<00:03:09.870> do

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
no damage there's two things you can do

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.759 
no damage there's two things you can do
one<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.129> can<00:03:11.280> make<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.780> down<00:03:12.780> taught<00:03:13.109> have

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
one you can make the down taught have

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.410 
one you can make the down taught have
damage<00:03:14.280> which<00:03:14.579> will<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.819> one<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> simple

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
damage which will be one of the simple

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.390 
damage which will be one of the simple
things<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:15.900> or<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.890> can<00:03:17.040> make<00:03:18.260> down<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
things to do or you can make down a have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
things to do or you can make down a have
the<00:03:20.609> animation<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:22.079> downtime<00:03:22.650> so

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
the animation of the downtime so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
the animation of the downtime so
realistically<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.940> same<00:03:24.269> thing<00:03:24.540> although

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
realistically the same thing although

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.620 
realistically the same thing although
true<00:03:25.139> taunts<00:03:25.500> should<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:25.829> do<00:03:25.950> damage<00:03:26.630> mr.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
true taunts should not do damage mr.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.900 
true taunts should not do damage mr.
cool<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:27.989> Luigi<00:03:28.349> so<00:03:28.950> what<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.519> do<00:03:29.639> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
cool like Luigi so what you can do is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.190 
cool like Luigi so what you can do is
all<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:32.190> copy<00:03:32.430> graphic<00:03:33.200> sound

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
all you have to do is copy graphic sound

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.610 
all you have to do is copy graphic sound
effect<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.799> other<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:38.959> once<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.109> copy<00:03:40.349> those

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
effect and other and once you copy those

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:48.920 
effect and other and once you copy those
so<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.459> go<00:03:41.989> graphics<00:03:43.130> copy<00:03:45.560> 60<00:03:47.750> get<00:03:48.750> rid<00:03:48.900> of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
so you go graphics copy 60 get rid of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.150 
so you go graphics copy 60 get rid of
all<00:03:49.139> these<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> graphics<00:03:50.880> of

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
all these this is just the graphics of

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.680 
all these this is just the graphics of
what<00:03:53.160> he's<00:03:53.280> doing<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.980> kind<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.280> tedious<00:03:56.690> but

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
what he's doing it's kind of tedious but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.020 
what he's doing it's kind of tedious but
you<00:03:57.840> know<00:03:57.959> coding<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.650> tedious<00:03:59.030> realistically

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
you know coding is tedious realistically

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.030 
you know coding is tedious realistically
right<00:04:00.269> you're<00:04:00.419> doing<00:04:00.510> right<00:04:00.720> now<00:04:01.040> it's

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
right you're doing right now it's

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.809 
right you're doing right now it's
telling<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.430> game<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:04.280> do<00:04:05.280> what<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.579> say

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
telling the game to do what you say

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.129 
telling the game to do what you say
which<00:04:06.299> in<00:04:06.450> essence<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:06.989> coding

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
which in essence is coding

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.099 
which in essence is coding
congratulations<00:04:10.139> you're<00:04:10.290> all<00:04:10.519> coders<00:04:11.519> now

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
congratulations you're all coders now

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:18.300 
congratulations you're all coders now

fireball all that drunk sound effect I
wonder<00:04:43.849> if<00:04:43.970> we<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.120> figure<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.419> one<00:04:44.479> out

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
wonder if we can figure that one out

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.180 
wonder if we can figure that one out
does<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> sound<00:04:46.039> and<00:04:46.270> other<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:48.190> ties

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
does the sound and other it ties

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.100 
does the sound and other it ties
everything<00:04:49.580> together<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:50.270> ties<00:04:50.479> this<00:04:50.750> to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
everything together it ties this to

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.230 
everything together it ties this to
other<00:04:51.289> things<00:04:51.680> ties<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.699> how<00:04:52.909> it's<00:04:53.120> going

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
other things ties it to how it's going

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.170 
other things ties it to how it's going
to<00:04:53.270> behave<00:04:53.419> to<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.050> physics<00:04:55.060> it's<00:04:56.060> called

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
to behave to the physics it's called

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.409 
to behave to the physics it's called
other<00:04:56.389> because<00:04:57.699> pretty<00:04:58.699> much<00:04:58.789> everything

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
other because pretty much everything

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:07.029 
other because pretty much everything
else<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:02.199> believe<00:05:03.199> that's<00:05:03.289> everything<00:05:05.289> yeah<00:05:06.289> so

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
else I believe that's everything yeah so

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.580 
else I believe that's everything yeah so
right<00:05:07.220> now<00:05:07.250> what's<00:05:07.849> going<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.060> happen<00:05:08.330> is

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
right now what's going to happen is

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.499 
right now what's going to happen is
you're<00:05:09.590> going<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.800> actually<00:05:09.919> do<00:05:10.190> attack<00:05:10.509> l4l

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
you're going to actually do attack l4l

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.520 
you're going to actually do attack l4l
w-4<00:05:12.229> so<00:05:13.009> we<00:05:13.099> forgot<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:14.110> change<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.349> animation

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
w-4 so we forgot to change the animation

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.589 
w-4 so we forgot to change the animation
name<00:05:16.009> and<00:05:16.250> animation<00:05:16.669> flag<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.419> go<00:05:17.539> to

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
name and animation flag so you go to

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.200 
name and animation flag so you go to
your<00:05:17.810> animation<00:05:18.379> you're<00:05:18.500> changing<00:05:18.889> copy<00:05:19.580> ctrl

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
your animation you're changing copy ctrl

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:28.050 
your animation you're changing copy ctrl
C<00:05:20.449> first<00:05:20.990> check<00:05:21.229> out<00:05:21.349> flick<00:05:21.849> nothing<00:05:23.770> 60

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.240 

actually<00:05:29.060> paste<00:05:29.330> animation<00:05:30.080> flags<00:05:30.349> also<00:05:31.159> has

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
actually paste animation flags also has

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.129 
actually paste animation flags also has
nothing<00:05:31.550> perfect<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:32.270> now<00:05:32.360> we're<00:05:32.509> done<00:05:32.659> when

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
nothing perfect so now we're done when

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.399 
nothing perfect so now we're done when
we<00:05:33.169> press<00:05:33.770> down<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.360> what<00:05:35.360> will<00:05:35.509> happen<00:05:35.900> is<00:05:36.020> well

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
we press down a what will happen is well

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.939 
we press down a what will happen is well
you<00:05:36.590> are<00:05:36.860> down<00:05:37.159> talked<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:37.909> it<00:05:38.840> will<00:05:38.990> act<00:05:39.229> like

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
you are down talked and it will act like

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.779
