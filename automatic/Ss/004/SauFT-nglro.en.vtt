Faced<00:01:00.180> melted<00:01:00.440> packaging<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.890> very

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Faced melted packaging is like very

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.520 
Faced melted packaging is like very
similar<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> black<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> gold<00:01:03.719> accents

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
similar with the black and gold accents

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.190 
similar with the black and gold accents
and<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.240> definite<00:01:06.720> shades

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and there are some definite shades

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
and there are some definite shades
similarities<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> texture<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
similarities I think the texture of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
similarities I think the texture of
these<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.780> completely<00:01:10.320> different<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> would

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
these is completely different I would

in-depth<00:01:15.450> details<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.290> these<00:01:16.710> feel<00:01:16.950> very

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in-depth details but these feel very

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.820 
in-depth details but these feel very
velvety<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> lips<00:01:18.509> there's<00:01:19.049> not<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> ton<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
velvety on the lips there's not a ton of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
velvety on the lips there's not a ton of
shine<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.270> maybe<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> little

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
shine with these you know maybe a little

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
shine with these you know maybe a little
bit<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> onset<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> apply

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
bit right at the onset when you apply

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
bit right at the onset when you apply
them<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> very<00:01:24.720> velvety<00:01:25.229> product

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
them but they're a very velvety product

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.350 
them but they're a very velvety product
and<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.490> matte<00:01:26.790> finish<00:01:27.000> very

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and they go to a matte finish very

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
and they go to a matte finish very
quickly<00:01:27.720> these<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.220> matte<00:01:29.490> finish

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
quickly these can go to a matte finish

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.999 
quickly these can go to a matte finish
too<00:01:30.150> once<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> shine<00:01:31.140> wears<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:31.680> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
too once some of the shine wears off but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.460 
too once some of the shine wears off but
overall<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.700> consistency<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:34.049> thinner

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
overall the consistency is a lot thinner

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
overall the consistency is a lot thinner
lace<00:01:34.950> lip<00:01:35.280> paints<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.759> more<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
lace lip paints are more of like a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.270 
lace lip paints are more of like a
liquid<00:01:36.720> whereas<00:01:37.320> these<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.740> more<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
liquid whereas these are more like a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
liquid whereas these are more like a
cream<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> lip<00:01:39.479> tars<00:01:39.750> from<00:01:40.049> obsessive

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
cream and so the lip tars from obsessive
