00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
there are ten dollar panini sandwiches

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
there are ten dollar panini sandwiches
but<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> tell<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.620> auditorium<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but I can tell you this auditorium is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
but I can tell you this auditorium is
creative<00:00:38.250> highly<00:00:38.850> original<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.629> lot<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
creative highly original and a lot of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.680 
creative highly original and a lot of
fun<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> idea<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.850> there's<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.300> force

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
fun the idea is that there's this force

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.510 
fun the idea is that there's this force
called<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> flow<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.129> your<00:00:44.280> job<00:00:44.460> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
called the flow and it's your job to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.220 
called the flow and it's your job to
direct<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.149> audio<00:00:45.480> containers

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
direct it into audio containers

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.690 
direct it into audio containers
throughout<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> playing<00:00:46.920> field<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> create

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
throughout the playing field to create

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.760 
throughout the playing field to create
music<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.780> catch<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.379> can't<00:00:49.590> just

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
music the catch is that you can't just

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
music the catch is that you can't just
move<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> flow<00:00:50.399> around<00:00:50.670> however<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
move the flow around however you want to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
move the flow around however you want to
you<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> make<00:00:52.469> sure<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> proper

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you have to make sure it's the proper

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.979 
you have to make sure it's the proper
color<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.760> every<00:00:53.879> audio<00:00:54.329> container<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
color for every audio container it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.720 
color for every audio container it
touches<00:00:55.379> by<00:00:55.590> moving<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> through<00:00:56.100> rings<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
touches by moving it through rings of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.420 
touches by moving it through rings of
color<00:00:57.559> positioning<00:00:58.559> directional<00:00:59.070> icons

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
color positioning directional icons

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.189 
color positioning directional icons
around<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.879> field<00:01:00.149> will<00:01:00.390> bend<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> flow<00:01:01.050> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
around the field will bend the flow in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
around the field will bend the flow in
specific<00:01:01.680> directions<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.030> control

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
specific directions and you can control

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
specific directions and you can control
the<00:01:03.600> amount<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> force<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> every<00:01:04.799> icon

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the amount of force that every icon

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
the amount of force that every icon
exerts<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.420> trick<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.750> using<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> limited

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
exerts the trick is using the limited

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.440 
exerts the trick is using the limited
icons<00:01:07.860> available<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.610> make<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> flow<00:01:09.119> fill

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
icons available to make the flow fill

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
icons available to make the flow fill
every<00:01:09.869> single<00:01:10.229> audio<00:01:10.439> container<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.189> the

every single audio container on the

every single audio container on the
field<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.180> difficulty<00:01:12.720> ramps<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.170> pretty

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
field the difficulty ramps up pretty
