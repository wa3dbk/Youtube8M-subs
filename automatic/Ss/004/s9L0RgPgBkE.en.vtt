00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
necklace section with the tensor fasciae

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
necklace section with the tensor fasciae

semitendinosus and Publix so TfL is very

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.599 
semitendinosus and Publix so TfL is very
powerful<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:26.600> incredibly<00:01:26.799> important<00:01:27.799> in<00:01:28.039> its

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
powerful and incredibly important in its

stabilize<00:01:31.700> at<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.240> hip<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:33.350> helps<00:01:33.649> to<00:01:33.740> study

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
stabilize at the hip it helps to study

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.949 
stabilize at the hip it helps to study
the<00:01:34.340> pelvis<00:01:35.000> relative<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.600> trunk<00:01:35.810> and

the pelvis relative to the trunk and
knee<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> very<00:01:37.340> important<00:01:37.670> muscle<00:01:37.759> it's

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
knee so a very important muscle it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.090 
knee so a very important muscle it's
often<00:01:38.539> known<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.990> dog<00:01:39.170> peed<00:01:39.469> on<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.679> hydrant

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
often known as the dog peed on a hydrant

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.709 
often known as the dog peed on a hydrant
muscle<00:01:40.490> because<00:01:40.850> when<00:01:41.030> it's<00:01:41.149> short

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
muscle because when it's short

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.139 
muscle because when it's short
it<00:01:41.929> helps<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.560> flex<00:01:42.950> internally<00:01:43.700> rotate

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
it helps you to flex internally rotate

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.230 
it helps you to flex internally rotate
and<00:01:44.509> maybe<00:01:45.350> ducked<00:01:45.850> when<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:46.969> long<00:01:47.209> and

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
and maybe ducked when it's long and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.819 
and maybe ducked when it's long and
doesn't<00:01:47.539> course<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.929> opposite<00:01:48.289> of<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.590> to

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
doesn't course the opposite of that to

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.050 
doesn't course the opposite of that to
bring<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:49.219> into<00:01:49.429> this<00:01:49.549> position<00:01:49.759> of

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
bring you into this position of

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.990 
bring you into this position of
extension<00:01:50.719> adduction<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:52.000> external

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
extension adduction and external

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.620 
extension adduction and external
rotation

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
rotation

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.929

so<00:01:53.989> it's<00:01:54.289> eason<00:01:54.619> control<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.429> extremely

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
so it's eason control is extremely

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.639 
so it's eason control is extremely
important<00:01:56.420> during<00:01:56.659> during<00:01:56.929> that<00:01:57.170> propulsive
