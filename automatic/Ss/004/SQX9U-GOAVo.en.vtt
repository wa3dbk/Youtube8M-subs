00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
rotted some some edges in there so that

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
rotted some some edges in there so that
when<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.390> slide<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:03.780> shelves<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.439> there<00:02:04.560> they'll

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
when I slide my shelves in there they'll

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.399 
when I slide my shelves in there they'll
go<00:02:05.369> completely<00:02:05.969> against<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.540> won't<00:02:07.290> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
go completely against there won't have

like that inside the
so<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.920> bottom<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> drawer<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.940> won't

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
so or the bottom of the drawer I won't

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.000 
so or the bottom of the drawer I won't
have<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> nail<00:02:13.050> any<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> I'll<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.800> able<00:02:13.830> to

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
have to nail any of it I'll be able to

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.310 
have to nail any of it I'll be able to
just<00:02:14.100> go<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:14.520> all<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.970> hold<00:02:15.480> everything<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:16.170> by

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
just go at all and hold everything in by

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.830 
just go at all and hold everything in by
the<00:02:16.380> four<00:02:16.680> sides<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.850> are<00:02:17.910> my<00:02:18.210> four<00:02:18.510> sides

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the four sides these are my four sides

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.220 
the four sides these are my four sides
right<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.240> then<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.020> going<00:02:22.140> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
right here so and then this is going to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170 
right here so and then this is going to
be<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.440> front<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> drawer<00:02:23.250> which<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
be the front of the drawer which is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.600 
be the front of the drawer which is
going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> go<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.630> top<00:02:24.870> which<00:02:25.170> has<00:02:25.920> an<00:02:26.160> edging

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
going to go on top which has an edging

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.230 
going to go on top which has an edging
on<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.810> very<00:02:27.870> similar<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
on it that is very similar to the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.790 
on it that is very similar to the
different<00:02:30.690> edges<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.140> put<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.500> every

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
different edges that I put on every

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.550 
different edges that I put on every
everything<00:02:32.550> else<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.750> pretty<00:02:34.140> much<00:02:34.320> that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
everything else so pretty much that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.170 
everything else so pretty much that
should<00:02:34.770> be<00:02:34.890> put<00:02:35.070> together<00:02:35.250> within<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> next

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
should be put together within the next

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.830 
should be put together within the next
day<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:38.030> really<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.300> only<00:02:39.330> thing<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
day or so and really the only thing that

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.350 
day or so and really the only thing that
I<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.080> left<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.830> door<00:02:41.070> now<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.970> door

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I have left is the door now the door

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.030 
I have left is the door now the door
I've<00:02:42.570> been<00:02:42.750> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.050> contemplating<00:02:43.740> on<00:02:43.860> what

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I've been kind of contemplating on what

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.680 
I've been kind of contemplating on what
I'm<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> glass<00:02:45.090> front

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
I'm going to do if I want a glass front

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.170 
I'm going to do if I want a glass front
or<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.110> want<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.350> full<00:02:46.590> wooden<00:02:46.980> front<00:02:47.310> but

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
or if I want a full wooden front but

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.090 
or if I want a full wooden front but
because<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.630> can't<00:02:48.690> get<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.170> piece<00:02:49.500> that's<00:02:49.770> wide

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
because I can't get a piece that's wide

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.970 
because I can't get a piece that's wide
enough<00:02:50.130> for<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.060> whole<00:02:51.300> front<00:02:51.660> I'm<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
enough for the whole front I'm going to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.880 
enough for the whole front I'm going to
actually<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> glass<00:02:54.330> front<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.020> it's<00:02:55.800> going

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
actually do a glass front and it's going

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.620 
actually do a glass front and it's going
to<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.100> two<00:02:56.310> separate<00:02:56.790> sections<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.690> glass<00:02:58.460> and

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
to be two separate sections of glass and

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.090 
to be two separate sections of glass and
hopefully<00:03:00.630> I'll<00:03:00.720> be<00:03:00.750> able<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.110> speak<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.070> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
hopefully I'll be able to speak with a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.610 
hopefully I'll be able to speak with a
glass<00:03:02.400> expert<00:03:03.000> or<00:03:03.180> plexiglass<00:03:03.570> expert<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
glass expert or plexiglass expert and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.010 
glass expert or plexiglass expert and
find<00:03:04.890> out<00:03:05.070> which<00:03:05.880> thickness<00:03:06.420> would<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
find out which thickness would be the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.590 
find out which thickness would be the
best<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.590> order<00:03:07.770> for<00:03:08.070> me<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.190> maintain<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
best in order for me to maintain the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.840 
best in order for me to maintain the
humidity<00:03:09.750> level<00:03:10.500> at<00:03:11.160> least<00:03:11.220> somewhat

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
humidity level at least somewhat

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.480 
humidity level at least somewhat
decently<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.620> pretty<00:03:13.890> much<00:03:14.040> that's<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.370> we

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
decently so pretty much that's what we

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.000 
decently so pretty much that's what we
have<00:03:14.700> here<00:03:15.200> everything<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.650> coming<00:03:16.860> together

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
have here everything is coming together

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.290 
have here everything is coming together
pretty<00:03:17.400> good<00:03:19.010> I'm<00:03:20.010> pretty<00:03:20.550> pleased<00:03:20.910> with<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
pretty good I'm pretty pleased with it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.710 
pretty good I'm pretty pleased with it
so<00:03:21.510> far<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.500> way<00:03:22.650> it's<00:03:22.830> come<00:03:23.070> out<00:03:23.480> also<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
I'm going to be making some smaller

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.380 
I'm going to be making some smaller
humidors<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.260> purchased<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:35.370> black<00:03:35.880> walnut

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.720 
humidors and purchased some black walnut
wood<00:03:36.630> which<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.260> going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.680> end<00:03:38.130> up<00:03:38.520> being

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
wood which is going to end up being

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.620 
wood which is going to end up being
really<00:03:39.090> nice<00:03:39.300> for<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:41.489> my<00:03:41.580> smaller<00:03:41.940> humidors
