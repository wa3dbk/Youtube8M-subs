00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.559
 says in the eggs in the videos 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.660
 previous 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.520
 to have better but it will not be julien 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.380
 because I believe I think I remember 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.500
 that I had told you azuréen but in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 do not it will be the before town because 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.710
 that in fact I had to start again 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.850
 at the party to do that to you but hey 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.260
 there are really plenty of blogs paul 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.730
 for putting or so here's if you 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.559
 are not sure yadin do not hesitate to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 watch other videos one more 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.059
 people who say how war and azur 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 there is not for this bug one you will 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 need a pokémon that is the capacity 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.379
 want to have arrived at least until the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.510
 sale do not worry you do not have 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.070
 need sister for this man that to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.070
 to stay acquires talk 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.320
 but lots of other buyer stuff 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.580
 so here you go there when I have 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.660
 lots of other stuff to do but in 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.830
 did it was a lot of stuff to do 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.610
 before making the bug 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 you'll see that later then there you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.090
 beat the trainer you want 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.350
 it can be him there there I said 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.180
 I do not want to fight 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.119
 buddha or could well beat and everything 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.130
 the world really makes everyone 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.130
 so that's where the buzz begins you 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.600
 put that in the save to ten behind and 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.330
 in fact you go advanced you put 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.530
 star right now where I can only 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.049
 did when you did that you go 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.990
 I was lucky we had made you 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:47.450
 know you're going to go to cells 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.110
 and cities it's true finally azure ya en 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.670
 French is gone you see you 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 want to make us a fight but hey the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 zap and well done for you so aulas 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.440
 the shit has already started the blue shield 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.900
 like you 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 so the bug has already started so there if 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.320
 you do not do what I finally tell you 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 after all on time that makes you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.870
 because you did not do this 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 that I am going to tell you one here is the shock 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.260
 and hurt 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.330
 so in fact listened to him very well 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.790
 in fact if you made a pokemon game 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.080
 red and you are you blue ah yes 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 I forgot to tell you that this bug is 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.330
 also compatible on yellow or green blue 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.280
 as usual as usual various 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.230
 again but it's useless so 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 has listened very well if you arrived 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.379
 in surya 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.819
 if you did like me in the blog 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.170
 will work but if you did all the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.090
 contrary to what I did the buzz does 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.540
 will not work then if you have been 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.480
 like me do not leave this side and 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 from that one there beat this trainer 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.140
 there you are already on the right track but 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 that's not all, so it was not necessary 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.829
 especially not beat sedan that because if 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 you leave it is apparently the bug does not 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.890
 not walk and there too as 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.420
 usually you go there you 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.220
 should not have beat his blockers 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.560
 do not worry about it and beat 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.670
 this one so I deacons and if you 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.379
 are doing what I like to say bin 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.379
 then you are going to have to do this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.239
 so here you are going to have to beat his 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.480
 trainers I did not tell you 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.480
 beat 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.630
 not beat him if it was the beat 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.230
 now what is not three camps 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.230
 rosicky 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.650
 that's it already it's true that it can 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.650
 to be complicated 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.560
 so here I feel for the complaint disappointed no 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.330
 but I assure you if you do not have 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.010
 did something that I told you the share 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.690
 because they took you the wrong 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.650
 road is low and beat the bad 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.900
 trainer ball for shit it's dead 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.010
 past what they said anyway 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.480
 that's what they said the club have 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.140
 however he invented a dream 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.880
 bailly agrees on it so after 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.270
 to have done that you do not move it is 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.330
 important 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.830
 you put pokemon when I put you in 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.840
 you use your little one but not having 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:19.549
 not learned the capf and want you 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:21.020
 you return to las ventas there alive said 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.900
 three years later and there look at this 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.120
 that is happening 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.360
 sahamies start alone who decorate 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.020
 i'm going mb 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:37.030
 look at the most wanted pokémon of 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.419
 all so we put or in front of our 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.379
 eyes 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.819
 what the fuck one of the biggest games to 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.960
 most useful bugs what I want 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.689
 tell the rate that has me the most wanted 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.849
 in before I will say on appeal a 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.949
 time there was a distribution ago 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.629
 long time I have not born you from this 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.539
 small world rolls in rest distribution 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.490
 half where he saw that 2 1 who wants to put 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.479
 something like that 4 km not a few 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.610
 kilometers but I remember 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.169
 it was that what made 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.509
 kilometers to all the japanese were 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.110
 there for putting where he sent the no 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.550
 the quiet with bunny so this bug 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.500
 is useful so there are several but 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.720
 So here we have put or so I have no 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.390
 pokemon gold I do not want to capture him 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.460
 but as usual I hope this 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.760

 so we'll beat him on the lease now 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.690
