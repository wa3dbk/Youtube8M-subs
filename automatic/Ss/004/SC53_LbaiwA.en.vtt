in a couple days pretty much here

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.300 
in a couple days pretty much here
starting<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.999> just<00:00:15.289> basically

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
starting off it's just basically

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.310 
starting off it's just basically
intercooler<00:00:17.310> piping<00:00:17.869> whichever<00:00:18.869> way<00:00:19.080> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
intercooler piping whichever way it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.970 
intercooler piping whichever way it's
gonna<00:00:19.470> go

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
gonna go

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.240 
gonna go
I<00:00:20.010> already<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.880> most<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.019> things

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
I already have most of the things

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.650 
I already have most of the things
preassembled<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.429> it<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> easier

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
preassembled so it can make it easier

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
preassembled so it can make it easier
when<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.170> install<00:00:26.009> it<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
when I install it just kind of be a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.490 
when I install it just kind of be a
quick<00:00:27.750> bolt<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.910> here's<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.089> intercooler<00:00:30.689> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
some intercooler piping that's already

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.090 
some intercooler piping that's already
set<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.130> the<00:00:47.700> specific<00:00:48.210> routing<00:00:49.100> schematics

foot stool here also another thing that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.160 
foot stool here also another thing that
I<00:01:45.299> had<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> custom<00:01:45.960> make<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:47.039> new<00:01:47.490> new<00:01:48.359> s<00:01:48.569> pipe

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.899 

can't<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.469> see<00:01:52.939> but

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
can't really see but

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.100 
can't really see but
right<00:01:55.509> in<00:01:55.689> here<00:01:56.460> there's<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.579> whole<00:01:57.820> new<00:01:58.149> longer

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
right in here there's a whole new longer

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.649 
right in here there's a whole new longer
piece<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.829> pipe<00:02:00.189> because<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.000> had<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.329> extend

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
piece of pipe because I had to extend

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.480 
piece of pipe because I had to extend
the<00:02:01.840> whole<00:02:02.079> pipe<00:02:02.320> just<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.680> little<00:02:02.979> bit<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.280> fit

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the whole pipe just a little bit to fit

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.410 
the whole pipe just a little bit to fit
the<00:02:03.700> custom-made<00:02:04.119> down<00:02:04.539> pipe<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.520> he<00:02:07.149> trapped

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
the custom-made down pipe and he trapped

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.290 
the custom-made down pipe and he trapped
it<00:02:07.600> obviously<00:02:08.349> goes<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.550> next<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.819> my<00:02:09.940> oil

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
it obviously goes right next to my oil

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
it obviously goes right next to my oil
pan<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.899> don't<00:02:11.110> want<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.440> really<00:02:11.620> put<00:02:12.489> off

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
pan so I don't want to really put off

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580 
pan so I don't want to really put off
all<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.940> heat<00:02:13.269> into<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.690> oil<00:02:13.870> pan<00:02:14.019> or<00:02:14.410> any

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
all that heat into the oil pan or any

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.470 
all that heat into the oil pan or any
other<00:02:14.860> components<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.209> that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480

next is just mainly my turbo assembly I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.320 
next is just mainly my turbo assembly I
think<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.069> showed<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.400> guys<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:33.700> before<00:02:34.150> it's

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.530 
think I showed you guys this before it's
nut<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:35.049> this<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:36.010> here's<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.090> custom

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
nut and this is it here's the custom

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.449 
nut and this is it here's the custom
made<00:02:37.690> down<00:02:38.230> pipe<00:02:38.819> that<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.849> had<00:02:40.180> done<00:02:41.459> he

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
made down pipe that I had done he

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.680 
made down pipe that I had done he
wrapped<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.910> obviously<00:02:45.090> there's<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.269> whole

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
wrapped it obviously there's the whole

here's<00:02:53.140> where<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> compressor<00:02:54.069> housing<00:02:54.220> is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
here's where the compressor housing is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.110 
here's where the compressor housing is
which<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.269> right<00:02:56.200> here<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:57.250> 50<00:02:57.880> trim<00:02:58.470> it's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
which is right here a 50 trim it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.520 
which is right here a 50 trim it's
pretty<00:03:01.120> much<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.480> 16<00:03:01.989> G<00:03:02.760> compressor<00:03:03.760> will

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
pretty much the 16 G compressor will

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.160 
pretty much the 16 G compressor will
normal<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.680> guess<00:03:05.920> you'd<00:03:06.130> say

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
normal I guess you'd say

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.190 
normal I guess you'd say
here's<00:03:08.280> wastegate<00:03:09.280> obviously<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.200> 8

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
here's wastegate obviously I have a 8

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.150 
here's wastegate obviously I have a 8
psi<00:03:11.829> spring<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.340> there<00:03:13.650> here's<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.799> turbo

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
psi spring in there here's the turbo

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.819 
psi spring in there here's the turbo
manifold<00:03:16.319> as<00:03:17.319> well<00:03:19.049> did<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.079> pretty<00:03:20.440> decent<00:03:20.650> job

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
manifold as well did a pretty decent job

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.949 
manifold as well did a pretty decent job
here's<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:24.069> old<00:03:24.340> wastegate<00:03:25.299> spring<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
here's the old wastegate spring that I

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.750 
here's the old wastegate spring that I
had<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.709> was<00:03:26.889> a<00:03:27.220> 4<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.180> 4<00:03:28.420> psi<00:03:28.959> spring<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:30.430> I

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
had it was a 4 the 4 psi spring so I

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.360 
had it was a 4 the 4 psi spring so I
went<00:03:31.690> up<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> 8<00:03:32.139> psi<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.889> wouldn't<00:03:33.190> have

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
went up to the 8 psi so I wouldn't have

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.970 
went up to the 8 psi so I wouldn't have
to<00:03:33.609> add<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.450> manual<00:03:35.109> boost<00:03:35.319> controller<00:03:35.769> or

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
to add a manual boost controller or

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.629 
to add a manual boost controller or
anything<00:03:36.190> like<00:03:36.519> that

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.490 

here's<00:03:39.639> I<00:03:40.090> guess<00:03:40.450> you'd<00:03:40.600> say<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.840> left<00:03:41.170> over

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
here's I guess you'd say it left over

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.300 
here's I guess you'd say it left over
packaging<00:03:42.359> for<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.630> rebuild<00:03:44.109> kit<00:03:44.410> that<00:03:44.889> I<00:03:44.920> had

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
packaging for the rebuild kit that I had

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.610 
packaging for the rebuild kit that I had
to<00:03:45.459> buy<00:03:45.639> because<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.209> first<00:03:46.450> time<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:46.720> started

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
to buy because the first time it started

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.420 
to buy because the first time it started
the<00:03:47.769> bit<00:03:48.730> oil<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.769> was<00:03:50.859> just<00:03:50.950> kind<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the bit oil so it was just kind of the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.360 
the bit oil so it was just kind of the
leftover<00:03:52.150> parts<00:03:52.510> old<00:03:52.780> parts<00:03:53.290> parts<00:03:54.130> that<00:03:54.280> I

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
leftover parts old parts parts that I

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.339 
leftover parts old parts parts that I
don't<00:03:54.430> need<00:03:54.849> really

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.720 

mainly<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.470> ones<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.739> gave<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.069> obviously<00:03:59.489> are

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
mainly the ones I gave it obviously are

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.319 
mainly the ones I gave it obviously are
already<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.329> rebuilt<00:04:01.939> so<00:04:02.939> that's<00:04:03.120> right

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
already in there rebuilt so that's right

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.390 
already in there rebuilt so that's right

in<00:04:43.800> here<00:04:44.070> ready<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:45.030> go<00:04:46.580> just<00:04:47.580> got<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.850> literally

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
in here ready to go just got a literally

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.520 
in here ready to go just got a literally
bolt<00:04:48.479> things<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:49.639> here's<00:04:50.639> my<00:04:50.820> oil<00:04:51.090> drain<00:04:51.630> tube

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
bolt things on here's my oil drain tube

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.939 
bolt things on here's my oil drain tube
here<00:04:52.949> I<00:04:53.130> use<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.210> push<00:04:54.449> lock<00:04:54.720> hose<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.680> time

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
here I use the push lock hose this time

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.270 
here I use the push lock hose this time
instead<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.520> steel<00:04:57.270> braided<00:04:57.599> hose<00:04:58.130> this<00:04:59.130> will

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
instead of steel braided hose this will

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.430 
instead of steel braided hose this will
work<00:04:59.340> perfect<00:04:59.849> because<00:05:00.120> it<00:05:00.300> stands<00:05:00.990> up<00:05:01.110> to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
work perfect because it stands up to

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.560 
work perfect because it stands up to
high<00:05:01.710> temps<00:05:02.190> very<00:05:02.729> high<00:05:02.940> temps<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.419> high

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
high temps very high temps and high

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.770 
high temps very high temps and high
pressure<00:05:03.840> obviously<00:05:05.389> pretty<00:05:06.389> much<00:05:06.539> I'll<00:05:06.690> just

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
pressure obviously pretty much I'll just

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.060 
pressure obviously pretty much I'll just
have<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.020> measure<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.349> out<00:05:07.440> once<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.800> get<00:05:07.860> it

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
have to measure it out once I get it

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.180 
have to measure it out once I get it
installed<00:05:08.400> cut<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.300> correct<00:05:10.190> length

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
installed cut it to the correct length

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.760 
installed cut it to the correct length
and<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:12.000> would<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.240> ready<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.599> go<00:05:12.770> again

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and that would be ready to go again

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.909 
and that would be ready to go again
here's<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.729> compressor<00:05:15.599> housing<00:05:15.720> all<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.590> got

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
here's the compressor housing all I got

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.610 
here's the compressor housing all I got
to<00:05:17.039> do<00:05:17.159> is<00:05:17.340> when<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:17.520> install<00:05:18.229> lining<00:05:19.229> up<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.500> how

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
to do is when I install lining up to how

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.270 
to do is when I install lining up to how
I<00:05:19.650> want<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.130> and<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:21.810> bolts<00:05:22.169> on<00:05:22.320> right<00:05:23.039> there

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
I want it and it bolts on right there

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.520 
I want it and it bolts on right there
just<00:05:23.669> like<00:05:23.820> that

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
just like that

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.680 
just like that
so<00:05:26.490> yeah<00:05:26.639> that's<00:05:28.099> so<00:05:29.099> pretty<00:05:29.370> much<00:05:29.690> that's

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
so yeah that's so pretty much that's

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.860 
so yeah that's so pretty much that's
what<00:05:30.870> I'm<00:05:30.990> gonna<00:05:31.080> start<00:05:31.289> off<00:05:31.440> with<00:05:32.690> here's<00:05:33.690> the

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
what I'm gonna start off with here's the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.339 
what I'm gonna start off with here's the
oil<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:34.650> I'm<00:05:34.770> gonna<00:05:34.919> start<00:05:35.190> off<00:05:35.370> with<00:05:35.400> here

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
oil that I'm gonna start off with here

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.439 
oil that I'm gonna start off with here
when<00:05:37.349> I<00:05:37.380> first<00:05:37.740> installed<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.370> I'm<00:05:39.120> not<00:05:39.330> gonna

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
when I first installed it I'm not gonna

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.330 
when I first installed it I'm not gonna
push<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.840> hard<00:05:40.169> obviously<00:05:40.830> when<00:05:41.010> I<00:05:41.039> first

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
push it hard obviously when I first

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.180 
push it hard obviously when I first
installed<00:05:41.580> it<00:05:41.970> because<00:05:42.479> it's<00:05:42.659> brand<00:05:42.930> new

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
installed it because it's brand new

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.189 
installed it because it's brand new
I<00:05:44.250> want<00:05:44.699> to<00:05:44.760> let<00:05:44.909> everything<00:05:45.120> sit<00:05:45.570> which<00:05:46.020> is

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
I want to let everything sit which is

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.330 
I want to let everything sit which is
why<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.710> got<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.490> high<00:05:47.639> mileage<00:05:48.169> which<00:05:49.340> pretty

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
why I got the high mileage which pretty

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.189 
why I got the high mileage which pretty
much<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.760> benefit<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:51.330> high<00:05:51.449> mileage<00:05:51.690> is

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
much the benefit of the high mileage is

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.580 
much the benefit of the high mileage is
it<00:05:53.180> controls<00:05:54.180> oil<00:05:54.539> consumption<00:05:55.110> because

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
it controls oil consumption because

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.700 
it controls oil consumption because
obviously<00:05:56.060> it's<00:05:57.060> going<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.720> try<00:05:58.349> to<00:05:58.409> push<00:05:58.680> a

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
obviously it's going to try to push a

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.310 
obviously it's going to try to push a
little<00:05:58.919> bit<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.190> oil<00:05:59.370> back<00:05:59.789> into<00:06:00.120> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
little bit of oil back into the

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.860 
little bit of oil back into the
intercooler<00:06:01.320> piping<00:06:01.949> but<00:06:02.610> this<00:06:02.849> has<00:06:03.539> a<00:06:03.599> little

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
intercooler piping but this has a little

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.800 
intercooler piping but this has a little
thicker<00:06:04.139> viscosity<00:06:05.029> different<00:06:06.029> minerals<00:06:06.599> in

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
thicker viscosity different minerals in

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.640 
thicker viscosity different minerals in
it<00:06:06.900> that<00:06:07.139> up

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
it that up

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.620 
it that up
prevent<00:06:08.070> most<00:06:08.520> of<00:06:08.699> that<00:06:08.850> from<00:06:09.060> happening

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
prevent most of that from happening

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.310 
prevent most of that from happening
until<00:06:10.259> I<00:06:10.290> can<00:06:10.590> have<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.490> little<00:06:11.759> seals<00:06:12.509> set

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
until I can have the little seals set

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.659 
until I can have the little seals set
and<00:06:13.560> everything<00:06:15.169> other<00:06:16.169> than<00:06:16.470> that<00:06:16.680> pretty

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
and everything other than that pretty

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.600 
and everything other than that pretty
much<00:06:17.850> now<00:06:18.690> it's<00:06:18.900> just<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.229> waiting<00:06:19.259> game<00:06:19.610> I've

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610
