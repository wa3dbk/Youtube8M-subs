00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 brave bold daring pilots and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 there's a lot in the dakar but you have to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.269
 see miguel sartorelli with what he's going to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.009
 run this if it's a tribe seriously 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230
 well this is a tubular chassis that 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.980
 was born in villa gesell with the brothers 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.970
 wall and where I ran with the Ford engine 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 esp box zf I ran for 10 years the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.129
 Argentine safari championship that same 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.450
 the car was modified , the 

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:30.329
 structure of the cage to make it 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.950
 approved by the cda and I put a 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.920
 mechanical a little more modern 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.120
 we equipped everything with txeroki that would be the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.480
 modern version of what is the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.760
 estanciera the jeep is the engine chiroque 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 4.0 injection with gearbox and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 of transfer also from txeroki and 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
 after good the body is formed 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 forming the suspension they went 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.130
 putting very sophisticated shock absorbers 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.050
 so that really responds well 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.230
 suspension and all accessories 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.700
 necessary for the proposal that makes you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.590
 a dakar load not certain as the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.410
 Resupplay of fuel 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.200
 good above all things the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.000
 comfort of the cabin as I told you 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.490
 the camera carries a ice cream maker for 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.680
 have something fresh to drink and well I 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.030
 I interpret and they the French also 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.100
 interpret that the true spirit 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.229
 Dakar is that we are us 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.410
 in the history of the dakar there were people who 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.440
 ran with four people there were 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.180
 ran with small cars with cars 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.670
 common large displacements in one 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.180
 time runs a 500 mercedes without double 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.830
 traction 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.540
 so I think that the spirit of 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.550
 dakar is to encourage itself to standardize something and 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.650
 then the message is already already been 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.660
 Miguel and I imagine that the idea should be 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.729
 besides competing to come to Lima 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.770
 yes yes we are going to do the impossible by 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.540
 Of course iron is not everything 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.610
 the world the environment motorsports what 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.100
 knows that even a ferrari in the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 formula one breaks and stays this 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.510
 iron is an iron but we go 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.610
 to put all the claw we are going to put 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 all the love and let's go people who 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.320
 we really know the audio with the idea 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.009
 of although it's last but try to 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.009
 get to lebanon
