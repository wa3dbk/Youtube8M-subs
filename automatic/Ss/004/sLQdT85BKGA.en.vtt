hey<00:00:04.470> guys<00:00:04.650> bow<00:00:04.950> HD<00:00:05.339> here<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:05.970> LG<00:00:06.330> g3<00:00:06.569> is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
hey guys bow HD here and the LG g3 is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.570 
hey guys bow HD here and the LG g3 is
something<00:00:07.259> pretty<00:00:07.529> unique<00:00:07.589> going<00:00:08.069> on<00:00:08.189> on<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
something pretty unique going on on the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.610 
something pretty unique going on on the
back<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> laser<00:00:10.170> autofocus

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
back and that is the laser autofocus

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.770 
back and that is the laser autofocus
sensor<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.460> accompanies<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.179> 13-megapixel

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
sensor that accompanies the 13-megapixel

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.289

what<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:16.379> guy<00:00:16.470> does<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.100> beams

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
what this little guy does is it beams

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
what this little guy does is it beams
infrared<00:00:17.880> light<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.359> subject<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> are

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
infrared light at the subject you are

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
infrared light at the subject you are
shooting<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.890> focuses<00:00:20.670> according<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> how

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
shooting and focuses according to how

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.019 
shooting and focuses according to how
close<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.050> far<00:00:22.080> away<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.680> subject<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
close or far away the subject is as the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
close or far away the subject is as the
light<00:00:24.180> bounces<00:00:24.359> back<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.260> sensor<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
light bounces back to this sensor and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.429 
light bounces back to this sensor and
since<00:00:26.580> light<00:00:26.789> travels<00:00:27.210> extremely<00:00:27.480> fast<00:00:27.689> that

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
since light travels extremely fast that

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
since light travels extremely fast that
translates<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.220> being<00:00:29.460> able<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> autofocus

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
translates to being able to autofocus

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
translates to being able to autofocus
extremely<00:00:31.199> fast<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.309> let's<00:00:32.520> take<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> look<00:00:32.880> at

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
extremely fast so let's take a look at

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
extremely fast so let's take a look at
this<00:00:33.030> camera<00:00:33.360> software<00:00:33.570> inside<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> g3<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this camera software inside the g3 to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580 
this camera software inside the g3 to
see<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:35.489> fast<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.989> upon<00:00:37.260> booting

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
see just how fast it is so upon booting

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
see just how fast it is so upon booting
up<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> camera<00:00:38.370> app<00:00:38.520> you'll<00:00:38.879> see<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> looks

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
up the camera app you'll see it looks

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
up the camera app you'll see it looks
pretty<00:00:39.629> familiar<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> cleanest

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
pretty familiar it's not the cleanest

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.889 
pretty familiar it's not the cleanest
looking<00:00:41.550> camera<00:00:41.760> app<00:00:42.000> out<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.210> but<00:00:42.719> then

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
looking camera app out there but then

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.810 
looking camera app out there but then
again<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.590> worst<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
again it's not the worst and it kind of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310 
again it's not the worst and it kind of
reminds<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> TouchWiz<00:00:46.020> user

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
reminds me of the TouchWiz user

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
reminds me of the TouchWiz user
interface<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> clean<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> up

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
interface but if you want to clean it up

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
interface but if you want to clean it up
and<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.780> super<00:00:49.379> simple<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> tap<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and make it super simple you can tap on

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
and make it super simple you can tap on
the<00:00:50.789> three<00:00:51.210> dots<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> left<00:00:51.989> hand<00:00:52.170> side<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the three dots on the left hand side to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
the three dots on the left hand side to
get<00:00:52.890> all<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.190> ugly<00:00:53.610> on-screen<00:00:54.120> buttons<00:00:54.539> out

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
get all those ugly on-screen buttons out

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
get all those ugly on-screen buttons out
of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> way<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:56.070> allows<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.670> tap<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of the way and it allows you to tap to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
of the way and it allows you to tap to
simultaneously<00:00:58.230> focus<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> capture<00:00:59.609> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
simultaneously focus and capture a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
simultaneously focus and capture a
picture<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.050> features<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
picture it's one of those features that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
picture it's one of those features that
would<00:01:01.739> probably<00:01:02.160> only<00:01:02.280> work<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
would probably only work well with a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.420 
would probably only work well with a
laser<00:01:03.390> autofocus<00:01:03.840> sensor<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> gotta<00:01:05.339> say

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
laser autofocus sensor but I gotta say

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
laser autofocus sensor but I gotta say
it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.909> pretty<00:01:06.210> sweet<00:01:06.450> feature<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.590> found

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it's a pretty sweet feature and I found

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
it's a pretty sweet feature and I found
that<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> makes<00:01:08.070> capturing<00:01:08.400> moving<00:01:08.909> subjects

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that it makes capturing moving subjects

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
that it makes capturing moving subjects
much<00:01:09.689> better<00:01:09.990> since<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> focuses<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> takes<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
much better since it focuses and takes a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
much better since it focuses and takes a
picture<00:01:11.750> faster<00:01:12.750> than<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.170> were<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.380> focus

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
picture faster than if you were to focus

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950 
picture faster than if you were to focus
and<00:01:13.950> press<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> shutter<00:01:14.640> button<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.780> besides

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and press the shutter button so besides

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
and press the shutter button so besides
that<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> left-hand<00:01:17.009> side<00:01:17.189> you'll<00:01:17.580> also

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that on the left-hand side you'll also

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
that on the left-hand side you'll also
find<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> flash<00:01:18.600> on/off<00:01:19.170> toggle<00:01:19.500> button<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
find the flash on/off toggle button a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520 
find the flash on/off toggle button a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really nothing new here magic focus is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.140 
really nothing new here magic focus is
kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> HTC<00:01:34.619> One<00:01:35.009> m8<00:01:35.400> EU<00:01:35.729> focus

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
kind of like the HTC One m8 EU focus

m8 since the m8 has two camera sensors
but<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:43.530> say<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> definitely<00:01:44.100> works

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
but i would say it definitely works

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.310 
but i would say it definitely works
better<00:01:44.430> than<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> samsung<00:01:45.240> approach<00:01:45.600> since

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
better than the samsung approach since

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 
better than the samsung approach since
samsung<00:01:46.740> phones<00:01:46.950> make<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.310> take<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> picture

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
samsung phones make you take a picture

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
samsung phones make you take a picture
then<00:01:48.360> move<00:01:48.600> slightly<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> left<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.530> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
then move slightly to the left or right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
then move slightly to the left or right
and<00:01:49.950> take<00:01:50.460> another<00:01:50.700> picture<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and take another picture and then it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
and take another picture and then it
tries<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.020> stitch<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.590> together<00:01:52.740> while

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
tries to stitch the two together while

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
tries to stitch the two together while
the<00:01:53.700> LG<00:01:54.000> g3<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.750> takes<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.170> ton<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> Rapid

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the LG g3 just takes a ton of Rapid

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
the LG g3 just takes a ton of Rapid
Shots<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.460> different<00:01:56.850> focus<00:01:57.240> levels<00:01:57.659> which

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
Shots with different focus levels which

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
Shots with different focus levels which
lets<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.500> customize<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.610> focus<00:01:59.909> or

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
lets you customize what is in focus or

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.050 
lets you customize what is in focus or
not<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.200> besides<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.680> magic<00:02:02.009> focus<00:02:02.399> shot<00:02:02.700> the

not but besides the magic focus shot the
panorama<00:02:03.659> mode<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.439> straightforward

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
panorama mode is pretty straightforward

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.679 
panorama mode is pretty straightforward
so<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:06.000> too<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.450> depth

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
so I'm not really to go too in depth

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.020 
so I'm not really to go too in depth

here and the dual camera mode is the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
is it captures picture and video from

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.610 
is it captures picture and video from
both<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
same time a feature that I think is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180 
same time a feature that I think is
incredibly<00:02:18.599> pointless<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.319> mean<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.739> don't

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
incredibly pointless I mean I just don't

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.670 
incredibly pointless I mean I just don't
see<00:02:20.459> any<00:02:20.730> need<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.299> at<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:22.409> that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
see any need for it at all but that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.949 
see any need for it at all but that
might<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.129> me<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.239> last<00:02:24.420> icon<00:02:24.810> on

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
might just be me and so the last icon on

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.020 
might just be me and so the last icon on

you can turn the HDR on or off you can

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
you can turn the HDR on or off you can
set<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> resolution<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:33.030> want<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.299> capture

set the resolution you want to capture
as<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.590> can<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.860> i'm<00:02:35.010> capturing<00:02:35.220> pictures<00:02:35.760> in

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
as you can see i'm capturing pictures in

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.699 
as you can see i'm capturing pictures in
the<00:02:36.060> highest<00:02:36.329> resolution<00:02:36.629> possible<00:02:36.959> which<00:02:37.560> is

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
the highest resolution possible which is

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.369 
the highest resolution possible which is
13<00:02:38.129> megapixels<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.329> can<00:02:39.450> also<00:02:39.569> turn<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:39.870> voice

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
13 megapixels you can also turn on voice

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.229 
13 megapixels you can also turn on voice
shutter<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.159> allows<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.610> capture<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
shutter that allows you to capture a

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.089 
shutter that allows you to capture a
picture<00:02:42.510> by<00:02:42.900> saying<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.349> variety<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.799> words

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
picture by saying a variety of words

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.240 
picture by saying a variety of words
such<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.790> cheese<00:02:45.329> or<00:02:45.629> smile<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.769> then<00:02:46.890> finally

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
such as cheese or smile and then finally

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.069 
such as cheese or smile and then finally
there's<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.640> timer<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> then<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.690> button<00:02:49.049> to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
there's a timer and then a button to

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.890 
there's a timer and then a button to
turn<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> grid<00:02:49.829> on<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.280> off<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.629> that<00:02:51.780> is

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
turn the grid on or off and so that is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.449 
turn the grid on or off and so that is
essentially<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.379> makes<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.920> camera<00:02:53.310> app

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
essentially what makes up the camera app

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.630 
essentially what makes up the camera app
on<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.879> LG<00:02:54.390> g3<00:02:54.829> so<00:02:55.829> without<00:02:56.069> further<00:02:56.129> ado

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
on the LG g3 so without further ado

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.830 
on the LG g3 so without further ado
let's<00:02:56.879> actually<00:02:57.030> take<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.329> look<00:02:57.569> at<00:02:57.660> some

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
let's actually take a look at some

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.170 
let's actually take a look at some
sample<00:02:58.049> footage<00:02:58.470> because<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.519> camera<00:02:59.909> takes

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
sample footage because this camera takes

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.869 
sample footage because this camera takes
awesome<00:03:00.390> photos<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.010> unfortunately<00:03:02.670> where<00:03:02.849> I

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
awesome photos so unfortunately where I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.330 
awesome photos so unfortunately where I
live<00:03:03.239> has<00:03:03.540> been<00:03:03.930> mostly<00:03:04.290> overcast<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.129> rainy

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
live has been mostly overcast and rainy

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.670 
live has been mostly overcast and rainy
which<00:03:06.030> isn't<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.420> best<00:03:06.659> scenario<00:03:06.840> for<00:03:07.200> truly

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
which isn't the best scenario for truly

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.860 
which isn't the best scenario for truly
showing<00:03:08.040> off<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.400> camera<00:03:08.760> can<00:03:08.909> do<00:03:09.120> but

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
showing off what a camera can do but

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.420 
showing off what a camera can do but
