guess you got to have a three-year-old

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400 
guess you got to have a three-year-old
in<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> hole<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> whenever<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.199> dig<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
in the hole with you whenever you dig a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.349 
in the hole with you whenever you dig a
hole<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.920> don't<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.580> anybody's<00:00:17.970> noticed

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
hole I don't know if anybody's noticed

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.609 
hole I don't know if anybody's noticed
this<00:00:18.510> oh<00:00:18.750> yes<00:00:19.170> ended<00:00:19.500> an<00:00:19.590> 11-year<00:00:20.039> old<00:00:20.330> that's

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
this oh yes ended an 11-year old that's

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.950 
this oh yes ended an 11-year old that's
that's<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> necessity<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.600> here

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that's a necessity so you can see here

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.429 
that's a necessity so you can see here
there's<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.539> micrometer<00:00:27.539> yes<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.080> call<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
there's the micrometer yes you call it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
there's the micrometer yes you call it
the<00:00:28.529> thing<00:00:28.740> spins<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.310> fast<00:00:29.490> whenever

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the thing spins really fast whenever

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.400 
the thing spins really fast whenever
there's<00:00:30.359> water<00:00:30.599> being<00:00:30.929> used<00:00:32.750> all<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:33.899> hey

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
there's water being used all right hey

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.440 
there's water being used all right hey
what's<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.770> daddy's<00:00:35.219> talking<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.270> thing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
what's my daddy's talking so that thing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.979 
what's my daddy's talking so that thing
will<00:00:36.570> spin<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:37.230> there's<00:00:37.410> water<00:00:37.620> being<00:00:37.980> years

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
will spin when there's water being years

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.250 
will spin when there's water being years
there<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.260> no<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.649> focused<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.079> can

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
there we go no we focused and you can

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.580 
there we go no we focused and you can
see<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:45.149> turning<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:46.140> now

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.200 

which<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> very<00:00:50.039> interesting<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
which is very interesting because I

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
which is very interesting because I
assumed<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.840> had<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> leak<00:00:52.579> yeah<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
assumed that we had a leak yeah and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.400 
assumed that we had a leak yeah and
that's<00:00:54.000> why<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> water<00:00:54.539> bill<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.170> high

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that's why the water bill was so high

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
that's why the water bill was so high
but<00:01:01.250> once<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.430> separate<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.000> meters<00:01:03.300> we'll

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but once we separate these meters we'll

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.410 
but once we separate these meters we'll
know<00:01:03.840> where<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:11.299> at<00:01:12.299> all

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
know where the water is going at all

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450 
know where the water is going at all
which<00:01:13.080> means<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.770> no<00:01:14.010> hole<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
which means that there is no hole in the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
which means that there is no hole in the
line<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> truck<00:01:15.750> driving<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
line and that the truck driving over it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.070 
line and that the truck driving over it
did<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.100> hurt<00:01:17.280> anything<00:01:18.080> so

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
did not really hurt anything so

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.870 
did not really hurt anything so
somebody's<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.890> using<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> water<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
somebody's just using a lot of water and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.149 
somebody's just using a lot of water and
it<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.150> makes<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.540> good<00:01:21.659> tenant-landlord

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
it just makes for good tenant-landlord

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.789 
it just makes for good tenant-landlord
relationship<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.560> separate<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
relationship if you separate all the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.039 
relationship if you separate all the
bills<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.780> any

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
bills that way you don't have any

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
bills that way you don't have any
control<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.670> thermostat<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.909> water<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
control over thermostat the water the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.030 
control over thermostat the water the
electric<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.470> house<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.860> all

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040

everything<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.090> completely<00:01:33.540> separate<00:01:34.110> points

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
everything is completely separate points

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.350 
everything is completely separate points
this<00:01:34.590> water<00:01:34.890> movement<00:01:35.369> yes<00:01:35.520> there's<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
this water movement yes there's the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840

foundation work on this house and your
siding<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:58.500> had<00:01:58.710> quite<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> work<00:01:59.369> done

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
siding it's had quite a bit of work done

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.800 
siding it's had quite a bit of work done
to<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.969> but<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.390> worth<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.870 

so<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.650> two<00:02:05.799> new<00:02:05.920> water<00:02:06.130> lines<00:02:06.400> will<00:02:06.580> be<00:02:06.700> in

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
so the two new water lines will be in

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.230 
so the two new water lines will be in
very<00:02:07.030> soon<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.800> I'll<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:09.069> more<00:02:09.670> videos<00:02:09.729> up
