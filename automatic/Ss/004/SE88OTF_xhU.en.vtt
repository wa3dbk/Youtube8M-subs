00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.170 
going to kind of define a little bit
more<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> smaller<00:01:51.390> blending<00:01:52.110> brush<00:01:52.500> and

I just kind of gave up and just kind of
went<00:05:33.880> with<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.150> flow<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.420> know<00:05:34.630> but<00:05:35.290> you<00:05:35.650> can

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
went with the flow you know but you can

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.710 
went with the flow you know but you can
always<00:05:36.040> stop<00:05:36.610> and<00:05:36.850> look<00:05:36.970> at<00:05:37.150> yourself<00:05:37.540> in<00:05:37.690> the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
always stop and look at yourself in the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.420 
always stop and look at yourself in the
mirror<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.110> see<00:05:38.440> if<00:05:38.590> your<00:05:38.800> eye<00:05:38.830> makeup<00:05:39.130> is

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
second one later so this is the final

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.970
