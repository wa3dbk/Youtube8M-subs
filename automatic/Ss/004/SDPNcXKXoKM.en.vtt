00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.810

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.240

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.920

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.590

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.520
 it's not bad it's not bad we're going to look 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.520
 The emeralds 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 let's put them and let's grab everything 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 what we want 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.309
 everything we can here and here since 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.309
 here here here and here 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.810
 what happened 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.820
 I do not enter days anymore, you can not 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:00.660
 burn the good bread 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:06.370
 here it is difficult and it does not leave me anymore 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.670
 well this is a robbery 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.159
 but I'm going to show you how to steal from 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.030
 they 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.750
 for example that we your village does not 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.800
 four loaves good 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 If I have everything reading that I'm left without 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.740
 emeralds 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.480
 but we can do this we can the key 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.050
 of shift 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.810
 we click the mat bread and follow 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.750
 keeping the shield key gives us 4 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.510
 stacks of breads and we believe ourselves unexpected 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 but if we give it to is that is where 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.470
 we put to go to the menu of minecraft 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.080
 is what happens 57 emeralds 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.650
 and we had still run out 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.750
 no then he leaves happy I 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.240
 I am happy and everyone happy for life 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.990
 live 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.990
 good 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.770
 so they know all this is a village 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.770
 if we discover the sunsets of the villages 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.150
 it would not be a village anymore but we quote here 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.360
 and there are three doors this entity door 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.080
 you also take off 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.250
 it's kakÃ¡ I was shocked because it hit me is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.250
 Hitler's fault 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.380
 I break all the doors let's say that 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.560
 are all doors a village called 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.610
 we were answered goals 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.610
 Nothing like that 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160
 then we will find them 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.320
 characters that only steal you and good 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.069
 with the trick that teaches them of 64 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.650
 emeralds we took four stakes 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 and normally we would be left without 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.939
 none but with this trick we stay 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:08.430
 with 57 like see how they see there are 57 67 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.040
