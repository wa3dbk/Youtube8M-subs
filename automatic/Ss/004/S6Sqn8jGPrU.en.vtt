00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.040
 I think the cutest thing in the world is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.630
 Arrives today only I had a problem 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.579
 I have a dog, you already 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.559
 they even know that she is very jealous 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 she was a mixture of jealousy and fear of him 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 speech will leave you very close to us 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.290
 but when he comes near 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 she's like, and I'm doing her here. 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.289
 golden for you but finally who 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 accompanying social networks must have 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.829
 since it is a gift basket 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 acrilex that I found very cool here 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 Beautiful, thank you, and I really liked it. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 business that calls the fi fi field is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 cola you make you want the wait 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.409
 it will be 24 hours that it will dryer and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 he for this was even much better 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.140
 for some time I've been reading a lot 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.119
 messages from you asking to do 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.409
 customization of clothes then in this video 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.350
 I'll get some cabinet parts. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.479
 have no lives at all. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 praise that does not customizable transform 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.259
 they key business looks will 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.950
 transform very basic pieces and looks 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.840
 very cool 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.340
 come on then the first thing that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 People are going to make these balls for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.299
 They wore shirts basic but an encore 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 super cool and for that idea people 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
 Will it need to be some other fabric 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 Thinner may be early what you 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.329
 want to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.509
 the collar mold that I'm going to move to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 you ribbon of satin I gizz something 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.729
 to mark the mold scissors glue 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.720
 for crafts and trip 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.799
 I'm wearing black and white 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.960
 first we will mark the mold in the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.939
 filter as chalk or you want to give 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.939
 to see everything right and cut 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.850
 and does exactly the same thing with 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.640
 thinner fabric 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.110
 then just paste pasted first side and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.920
 then the other because it looks much better 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.920
 easy to stay straight 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.610
 a cool tip for having been not staying 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.660
 you are passing a base or 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.160
 colorless enamel around all angola 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:28.500
 cut two daughters the satin ribbon in 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:30.180
 diagonal and glue is very simple and I did 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.460
 several dots of agrippine end in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.910
 all angola is very easy, just make a 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.910
 little dot 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.330
 I made a splash of white in the middle 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.790
 when it favors to appear in the earth 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.920
 and leaves your car 24 hours 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.020
 in this other only one tape of fabric 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:56.620
 black and gray is very easy just pass 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:58.230
 glue and necklace finishes and 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.760
 way 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.660
 but whatever you want and let it dry 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.280
 for 24 hours and when you already have c 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.790
 People will pass the hair dryer well. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.790
 hot 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.370
 it's very cool and ethical rubbery and 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.810
 I really liked this feat. 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.740
 the two formats are absolutely 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.390
 incredible 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.070
 That's just you have created from you now 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.780
 white goes very well with a pair of jeans 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.550
 and an income race but has a 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.550
 normal reggae, everything was going to be beautiful 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.010
 I'm in love with this ball. 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.010
 super chic 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.459
 I have this white T-shirt that still 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.709
 more super basic then I put the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.950
 black ball gives a totally different air 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.950
 T-shirt 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.430
 now polka dotted and wore the t-shirt 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.080
 gray audio that I love by the way 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.820
 I'll make a mold available for you 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.830
 of these balls on my facebook page 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.300
 here below link is just you go there and 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.160
 to print out is yours 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.590
 The second idea is to transform a shirt 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.970
 basic white and rural in the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.010
 special to take 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.720
 I just took the shirt collar with a 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.250
 black pin since it puff that neither the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.540
 people made the black ball and I know that 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.540
 dryer 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.280
 just so the shirt is already amazing but 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.230
 I 'll dress her in a mango blouse. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:40.810
 3/4 black that was on the bottom of my 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:42.040
 husband looks super handsome and the third one 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.980
 The idea I made was to transform a 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.960
 shirt as a race like this in 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.620
 truth pajamas I became one 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.040
 blouse 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.640
 look it was a super dull piece 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.960
 the neckline at the front is very low 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.060
 so it 's the opposite because I 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.240
 I preferred the neckline on the back that is 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.190
 much higher and made this drawing of the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.020
 Mustache also a faithful contributor I picked up a 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.610
 pen and scored on the same body is 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.320
 It is important for you to conclude 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.360
 body because then you know exactly 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.700
 Where is the drawing going to be? 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.700
 Then I did the drawing pen and painted it. 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:28.730
 let it dry from day to day and 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:30.710
 the dryer turns to turn up 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.300
 a pajama a cool t-shirt stays 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.750
 perfect with a pair of jeans and a 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.750
 black pantsuit 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.330
