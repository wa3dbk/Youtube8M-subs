00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.789
 Hello everyone, I was asked to show how 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.730
 make a flower of cornflower bead 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.270
 so I started to do it, he is not ready yet 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.520
 of course now I will show you how 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.370
 you can do to start with us of course 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.410
 30 wires required 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 centimeters and for one flower to us 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.260
 take seven such pieces on I 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.440
 I collect 3 beads on a wire 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.719
 I am looking for the middle of the matter of this so bend 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.629
 straight ahead 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.460
 I pass one end of the wire through two 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.620
 and tighten it all we are the middle as 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.060
 there she would point a corner to everything there and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.450
 brakes further by one tail i 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.630
 I recruit again three and already 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.280
 I pass the same tail through the first and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.979
 the second 3 remains here by itself and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.380
 I delay and it is important not to have 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:30.560
 large gap between all beads 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:33.340
 so closer stock from the other end I 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.340
 doing the same thing 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 stir twisted nothing terrible in 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.600
 align them all here so here they are 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.540
 you should stand in a row further on 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:02:01.250
 I dial one end of the wire 7 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:02.509
 beads and this end free one 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.500
 which is without beads 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.420
 i am going backwards 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.399
 I tighten it at us such parallel 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.030
 weaving 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:27.680
 pressing everything I level on I type 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 6 beads and spend one wire again 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.950
 opposite friend and and so on to you 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.590
 don't tire i'll say what's next and do 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.590
 such rows are five four three two and one 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.590
 bead 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 so here it is the last and and tighten 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.330
 ready we have one petal ready all 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.120
 the remaining petals will cling to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.129
 him so i'm doing the next petal 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.510
 I get to the third row here I have 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:15.470
 these teeth then 7 6 5 4 3 next I 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.629
 I do the following one of the tails I 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.200
 spend 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.910
 meanwhile near where i have three and two 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.060
 between them on and from the bottom up, I 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:31.720
 caught on the edge now I'm typing 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.400
 two beads 1 2 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.590
 don't care what tail you have them 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.459
 type and pass through one again opposite 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.150
 friend and caught on again again 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:51.799
 tail which is closer to the finished part 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:54.230
 and I cling again to 1 row lower then 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.500
 there is where i have 2 and 1 bead i 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.130
 I spend from the bottom up top down this is 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.359
 it's up to you how you like it 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:15.519
 spent now again I only put on 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:15.519
 one bead so and so 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:23.389
 delay tightening is not necessary 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.260
 if you took the delay like mine 0 3 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 millimeter 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.650
 she keeps very well 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.040
 I cling to exactly the same system for sure 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.740
 in the same way from the other side 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.310
 so on further on until I have 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.280
 there will be 7 petals next to each other 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.800
 moment is the attachment of 7 petals 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.830
 Here in this weaved one part exactly the same 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.680
 as previous to the third row further 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.700
 the very thing begins 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:00.139
 let's say not very easy in this work 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.270
 you pass again between these 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.990
 delays between the third and second row 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.950
 on the one hand and on the other hand you 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.040
 we must now connect both sides and here 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.710
 this is where the easiest starts 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.860
 but surmountable you are recruited but 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.530
 theft 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:28.820
 threading and now you need to hold 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.030
 procrastination again meanwhile near where y 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.660
 you 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:38.690
 1 and 2 beads and do this with 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:48.669
 one side and the other side again 1 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:48.669
 and delay so 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.600
 Next we need to make a leg like this 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.760
 here is a little green chubby 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.860
 if you don't want to do it you can 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.600
 you can do without it but it seems to me 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.600
 so a little more beautiful turns out
