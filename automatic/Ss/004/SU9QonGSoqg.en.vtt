this game is simple all you have to do

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.009 
this game is simple all you have to do
is<00:00:24.420> say<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> word<00:00:26.180> that<00:00:27.180> represents<00:00:27.779> something

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is say a word that represents something

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
is say a word that represents something
that<00:00:28.439> has<00:00:28.560> nothing<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> word

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that has nothing to do with the word

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
that has nothing to do with the word
that<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> last<00:00:30.390> person<00:00:30.779> set<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> last

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that the last person set and if the last

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.150 
that the last person set and if the last
person<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.510> make<00:00:33.590> connection<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.890> their

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
person can make connection from their

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.720 
person can make connection from their
word<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:36.030> your<00:00:36.420> word<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> direct<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.730> very

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
word to your word a direct and very very

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.979 
word to your word a direct and very very
relevant<00:00:39.450> connection<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.760> lose<00:00:42.000> okay

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
relevant connection then you lose okay

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
relevant connection then you lose okay
so<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.320> goes<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:44.600> I<00:00:45.600> say<00:00:46.200> car<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
so it goes like this I say car so you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.160 
so it goes like this I say car so you
have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.420> something<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.989> has

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
have to think of something that has

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.670 
have to think of something that has
nothing<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.160> cars<00:00:50.460> whatsoever<00:00:51.680> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
nothing to do with cars whatsoever so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
nothing to do with cars whatsoever so
you<00:00:52.770> could<00:00:53.100> say<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.710> say<00:00:56.239> Mars<00:00:57.710> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you could say you could say Mars you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
you could say you could say Mars you
know<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.070> does<00:00:59.160> Mars<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
know what does Mars have to do with a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.709 
know what does Mars have to do with a
car<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.920> could<00:01:02.160> say<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:03.149> there's<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> car

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
car you could say well there's a car

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.850 
car you could say well there's a car
called<00:01:04.080> mercury<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.070> Mars<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> planet<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
called mercury and Mars is a planet and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
called mercury and Mars is a planet and
mercury<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> planet<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.360> there's<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
mercury is a planet so there's your

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
mercury is a planet so there's your
connection<00:01:10.170> that's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.770> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
connection that's a little bit of a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
connection that's a little bit of a
stretch<00:01:11.670> that's<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> debate<00:01:13.189> because

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
stretch that's up for debate because

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
stretch that's up for debate because
it's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> direct<00:01:15.030> connection<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.810> kind

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's not a direct connection it's kind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
it's not a direct connection it's kind
of<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.500> vague<00:01:16.979> connection<00:01:17.850> so

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of like a really vague connection so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
of like a really vague connection so
that<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:18.990> invalid<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> would<00:01:20.130> go

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
that would be invalid and you would go

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520 
that would be invalid and you would go
on<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> next<00:01:20.850> turn<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.299> whatever<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:22.350> has

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
on to the next turn or whatever what has

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.719 
on to the next turn or whatever what has
nothing<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.460> Mars<00:01:24.080> let's<00:01:25.080> say<00:01:25.729> how

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.539 
about Jesus Jesus has nothing to do with
Mars<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> could<00:01:31.409> say<00:01:31.619> well<00:01:31.829> Jesus<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> Son

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
Mars you could say well Jesus is the Son

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
Mars you could say well Jesus is the Son
of<00:01:32.610> God<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> created<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.509> things<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.590> that's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of God and created all things but that's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
of God and created all things but that's
not<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.100> direct<00:01:35.460> connection<00:01:35.759> because

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
not really a direct connection because

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
not really a direct connection because
there's<00:01:36.420> no<00:01:36.570> real<00:01:36.780> talk<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.350> Mars<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
