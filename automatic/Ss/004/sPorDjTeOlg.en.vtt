happy<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.119> played<00:00:24.510> chances<00:00:25.470> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
happy with the way we played chances we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.849 
happy with the way we played chances we
created<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> way<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.779> nullified<00:00:28.650> em

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
created the way we you know nullified em

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
created the way we you know nullified em
for<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.400> majority<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.330> know

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
for the majority of the game you know

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.760 
for the majority of the game you know
the<00:00:30.570> leading<00:00:31.109> scorers<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> lease<00:00:33.530> it<00:00:34.530> was

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the leading scorers in the lease it was

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
the leading scorers in the lease it was
frustrating<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> come<00:00:35.880> away<00:00:36.000> with

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
frustrating not to come away with

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
frustrating not to come away with
something<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:36.870> ultimately<00:00:37.290> that's<00:00:37.410> that's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
something in an ultimately that's that's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.049 
something in an ultimately that's that's
what<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.730> points

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
what we're here to do is to get points

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
what we're here to do is to get points
on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> board<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.930> know<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.040> was

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
on the board so you know that was

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.410 
on the board so you know that was
disappointing<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.969> said<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> overall

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
disappointing but I said the overall

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940 
disappointing but I said the overall
performance<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:43.260> certainly<00:00:43.530> take<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
performance will certainly take a lot of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
performance will certainly take a lot of
art<00:00:44.129> form<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.640> continue<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> play

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
art form and if we continue to play

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
art form and if we continue to play
though<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.289> did<00:00:46.410> against<00:00:46.739> RB<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.399> did

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
though we did against RB do I we did

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
though we did against RB do I we did
against<00:00:47.879> watford<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.079> we'll<00:00:49.230> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
against watford then you know we'll be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
against watford then you know we'll be
fine<00:00:49.879> Matt<00:00:50.879> Smith<00:00:51.120> came<00:00:51.300> back<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.600> loan<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fine Matt Smith came back from loan and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
fine Matt Smith came back from loan and
obviously<00:00:52.260> pushing<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> late<00:00:53.579> stages

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
obviously pushing on in the late stages

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
obviously pushing on in the late stages
of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> game<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.539> tactically<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.350> made<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
of the game and tactically that made you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
of the game and tactically that made you
have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> change<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> way<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> played

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have to change the way that you played

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.549 
have to change the way that you played
is<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.870> something<00:00:58.199> you're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> be

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is that something you're going to be

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.889 
is that something you're going to be
considering<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> next<00:01:00.090> few<00:01:00.510> games<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
considering for the next few games that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
considering for the next few games that
obviously<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.219> around<00:01:02.520> yeah<00:01:03.329> yeah

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
obviously don't that's around yeah yeah

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
well as always it's good to have sort of

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
know good for Matt Bristol haven't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
know good for Matt Bristol haven't
scored<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:14.100> number<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> goals<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.790> them

scored a good number of goals for them

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.149 
scored a good number of goals for them
so<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.110> he's<00:01:16.409> great<00:01:16.619> swimming<00:01:16.890> back

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so you know he's great swimming back

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.999 
so you know he's great swimming back
onboard<00:01:17.400> ease<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.630> felt<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.200> decision<00:01:19.890> its

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
onboard ease and I felt a decision its

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.499 
onboard ease and I felt a decision its
army<00:01:20.280> had<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.119> get

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
army had to get out and get get

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
army had to get out and get get
match-fit<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:22.259> sharp<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.540> hopefully<00:01:24.540> go

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
match-fit get sharp and and hopefully go

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
match-fit get sharp and and hopefully go
score<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:24.990> goals<00:01:25.290> which<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.560> exactly<00:01:26.070> what

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
score some goals which is exactly what

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
score some goals which is exactly what
he<00:01:26.520> did<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.970> now<00:01:27.840> we've<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.350> player

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
he did so now we've got a good player

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.170 
he did so now we've got a good player
back<00:01:28.829> who's<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> good<00:01:29.369> form<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:29.970> where

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
back who's in good form and that's where

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
back who's in good form and that's where
the<00:01:30.240> loan<00:01:30.390> system<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.960> work<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.320> but

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the loan system can work very well but

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499 
the loan system can work very well but
would<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.220> change<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:32.700> thought<00:01:33.119> process

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
would that change your thought process

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.240

in terms of the way that you set up for
a<00:01:35.280> game<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.790> way<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.150> started<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.659> or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it well I've got this I've got a way

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539

makes a huge difference so now we look

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.999

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
quite good i'll be quite pleased

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.719 
quite good i'll be quite pleased
obviously<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.770> guys<00:05:29.889> were<00:05:30.099> disappointed

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
obviously the guys were disappointed

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.249 
obviously the guys were disappointed
when<00:05:30.820> they<00:05:30.880> came<00:05:31.090> off<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.360> pitch<00:05:31.539> 1<00:05:31.570> 2<00:05:31.750> so<00:05:32.080> they

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
when they came off the pitch 1 2 so they

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.080 
when they came off the pitch 1 2 so they
thought<00:05:32.560> they<00:05:32.740> deserve<00:05:33.099> something<00:05:33.370> what's

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
thought they deserve something what's

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.879 
thought they deserve something what's
the<00:05:34.270> difference<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.690> picking<00:05:35.080> up<00:05:35.199> a<00:05:35.320> team<00:05:35.530> that

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
the difference in picking up a team that

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.529 
the difference in picking up a team that
that's<00:05:36.159> been<00:05:36.430> kind<00:05:36.789> of<00:05:36.849> a<00:05:36.969> little<00:05:37.090> bit<00:05:37.240> loan

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
that's been kind of a little bit loan

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.930 
that's been kind of a little bit loan
confidence<00:05:38.139> is<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:38.409> easier<00:05:38.860> after<00:05:39.099> they<00:05:39.669> know

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
confidence is it easier after they know

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.760 
confidence is it easier after they know
they<00:05:40.180> put<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.509> a<00:05:40.570> good<00:05:40.690> performance<00:05:40.750> or<00:05:41.409> does

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
they put in a good performance or does

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.600 
they put in a good performance or does
that<00:05:41.800> make<00:05:42.009> it<00:05:42.039> tougher<00:05:42.460> um<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:44.280> mean<00:05:45.280> there's

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
that make it tougher um I mean there's

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.159 
that make it tougher um I mean there's
two<00:05:45.820> ways<00:05:46.000> of<00:05:46.180> looking<00:05:46.240> at<00:05:46.479> your<00:05:46.659> natha<00:05:46.990> I

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
two ways of looking at your natha I

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.779 
two ways of looking at your natha I
think<00:05:47.680> sometimes<00:05:47.889> after<00:05:48.219> a<00:05:48.400> bad<00:05:48.610> performance

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
think sometimes after a bad performance

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.399 
think sometimes after a bad performance
you<00:05:49.090> can<00:05:49.240> really<00:05:49.509> get<00:05:49.690> into<00:05:49.990> them<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.259> give

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
you can really get into them and give

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.020 
you can really get into them and give
them<00:05:50.440> a<00:05:50.530> bit<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.800> volume<00:05:51.190> and<00:05:51.430> they<00:05:51.819> know

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
them a bit of a volume and they know

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.850 
them a bit of a volume and they know
they<00:05:52.210> need<00:05:52.360> they<00:05:52.780> let<00:05:52.990> themselves<00:05:53.110> down<00:05:53.380> so<00:05:53.800> to

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
they need they let themselves down so to

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.740 
they need they let themselves down so to
speak<00:05:53.949> but<00:05:54.849> she's<00:05:55.090> not<00:05:55.270> is<00:05:55.389> a<00:05:55.419> bit<00:05:55.569> different

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
speak but she's not is a bit different

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.809 
speak but she's not is a bit different
we<00:05:55.990> knew<00:05:56.289> we<00:05:56.500> put<00:05:57.039> in<00:05:57.130> a<00:05:57.190> solid<00:05:57.400> good

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
we knew we put in a solid good

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.330 
we knew we put in a solid good
performance<00:05:58.440> basically<00:05:59.440> step<00:05:59.650> frustration

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
performance basically step frustration

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.980 
performance basically step frustration
now<00:06:00.370> really<00:06:00.969> and<00:06:01.060> we<00:06:01.330> need<00:06:01.449> to<00:06:01.569> channel<00:06:01.750> that

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
now really and we need to channel that

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.350 
now really and we need to channel that

and turn that into real sore positive

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.540 
and turn that into real sore positive
energy<00:06:04.719> and<00:06:04.979> make<00:06:05.979> sure<00:06:06.130> we<00:06:06.250> get<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.520> right
