00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.310
 I had graduated from college three weeks before the accident 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.579
 at ohio university he played basketball 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.129
 he lived in kiosks about 2 100 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.039
 it's a very beautiful city 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.999
 I was in very good shape 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.330
 He was in 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.920
 ate in the intensive care unit and they did not give us any news that we 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.680
 gave hope before the beginning seemed to be a critical situation to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.000
 you 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.940
 she 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 the first memories I have are not very clear 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.730
 the way they work and memory I can not remember a little place 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.020
 specific time 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 and if I concentrate 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 much 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.310
 I still do not remember the hospital or having been in the emergency room 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.960
 our life took a total turn we slept in the waiting room of 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 intensive care 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.600
 we talked to different doctors who were treating him from different parts of 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.659
 his body and we just wait to see what happened 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.759
 he was born again 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.070
 It's like I see it 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.190
 I started like a baby I had to start thinking about the hospital 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 I was throwing tantrums 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.520
 kicked and turned everything like a baby, from there it gradually matures and becomes 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.620
 an adult 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.540
 back then I was totally a Sunni there was nothing 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.710
 I could not feed myself used diapers and believe me to put diapers to link 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.690
 about six feet 4 inches tall is not easy and slept about two hours each 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.020
 night we were very restless all the time 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.120
 valverde 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.650
 So I think there is a lack of public awareness 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 many of the people who suffer a brain injury would be more 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.480
 functional that you understand what your needs are, but if you can 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.550
 make the right decisions but you need a little more time to be able to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.470
 do it later 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.470
 the unfortunate to be at a level and interests if they wish it apparently not 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.530
 There is nothing wrong with him but it took him two years to get a job as a teacher 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.490
 after they gave him his certification 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.590
 He had many but many interviews before he could convince someone 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.590
 to be hired 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:57.389
 pineapple has spent so much time six and a half years since he was able to return to 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.150
 work which was a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
 a great achievement for him 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.640
 As you have problems with short-term memory sometimes you need to be 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.639
 remember some things 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.980
 at first you do not notice it much because when you see it outside with the students 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.150
 you know the name of each of them once you know it better you have to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.330
 get along very well with him because he is a very nice person he has so much 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.840
 enthusiasm for life loves to work with our students and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.339
 they love him very much 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.339
 Craig Moore returns at once 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.079
 percent the villarreal 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.549
 his short-term memory is very good a Catalan 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:56.799
 the short-term memory is not returned if you ask her or her 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.689
 go our there are ten days would be very difficult for him to remember 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:15.099
 david apaza has to save everything in files because if they do not find anything 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.919
 he does this in his personal life and at school 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.639
 this has been something important to show you how it will be organized also wanted to 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.639
 we also organize ourselves 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:36.019
 the memory is my biggest challenge my desk is covered with slips of paper 

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:37.840
 with others because 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.389
 since there are so many things to do that I need to remember 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.670
 keep your feet together are working as a team so he does not fall 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.449
 access for five seconds 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.229
 very well thank you very much to all appears with one foot out 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.139
 one foot out 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.139
 crouch as much as Thursday 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.370
 Perez does too much 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.229
 the now deceased 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.179
 it's well done, Martin scatters that others 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.419
 Now you have to do the gymnastics exercises very carefully 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.849
 because it's easy to hurt yourself 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.849
 you owe a person on the rug 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.210
 is due to a person on the fixed bar efe 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.159
 this year 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.999
 each event 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.839
 the state 

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.419
 every act of revenge the truth 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.300
 the future is as uncertain and as difficult to predict as it was the day when 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.639
 for the first time they told us that I would survive 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.569
 you never know how far you can go we can not know if he can 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.690
 know the client get married and have a normal life 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.020
 have children and live independently if we know that he says he continues 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:23.389
 trying to achieve that goal says it's one of your goals but you never know 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.379
 I can accept everything life starts because I still 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:34.279
 I'm here God has blessed me because he allowed me to continue living so 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:38.549
 I'm probably the most positive person you know 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:41.529
 3 60 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.529
 Weighed once will go single lap 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
 to see if they can go full circle 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.149
 the mayor recalled 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.809
 one 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.309
 measure to others 

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:01.249
 nothing
