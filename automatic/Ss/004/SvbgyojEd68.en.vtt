should let you know that I'm just making
up<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.560> recipe<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.670> basically<00:00:27.570> took

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
up this recipe as I go I basically took

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
up this recipe as I go I basically took
what<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> learned<00:00:28.410> online<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.609> applying

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
what I learned online and I'm applying

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
what I learned online and I'm applying
my<00:00:30.000> own<00:00:30.240> rules<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
my own rules to it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.100 
my own rules to it
I<00:00:31.560> found<00:00:32.250> corn<00:00:32.550> flour<00:00:32.820> which<00:00:33.120> i<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.870> corn

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I found corn flour which i think is corn

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.540 
I found corn flour which i think is corn
starch<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.070> seems<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.460> same

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
starch and it seems to have the same

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.670 
starch and it seems to have the same
texture<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> use<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> I'm

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
texture so we're going to use that I'm

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.799 
texture so we're going to use that I'm
going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> make<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.370> own<00:00:38.399> syrup<00:00:38.940> using<00:00:39.600> white

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
going to make my own syrup using white

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.139 
going to make my own syrup using white
sugar<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> water<00:00:40.460> I've<00:00:41.460> got<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:41.790> coffee

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
sugar and water I've got a little coffee

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
sugar and water I've got a little coffee
here<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.020> gonna<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.469> darken<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
here that we're gonna use to darken it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.760 
here that we're gonna use to darken it
down<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.660> using<00:00:45.660> red<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:45.899> green<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> reason

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
down and using red and green the reason

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.290 
down and using red and green the reason
why<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> chose<00:00:47.100> green<00:00:47.430> instead<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> blue<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
why I chose green instead of blue is

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.720 
why I chose green instead of blue is
because<00:00:48.600> Green<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.550> chromatically<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because Green is chromatically the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.490 
because Green is chromatically the
opposite<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> red<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.230> hoping<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
opposite of red so I was hoping that

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110 
opposite of red so I was hoping that
instead<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> turning<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> purple<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.820> anything

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
instead of turning it purple if anything

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.639 
instead of turning it purple if anything
it<00:00:54.180> would<00:00:54.239> turn<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.510> brown<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> blood<00:00:55.410> does

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it would turn it brown and blood does

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.260 
it would turn it brown and blood does
tend<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> have<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> brown<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tend to have a bit of a brown as to it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.139 
tend to have a bit of a brown as to it
so<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.899> go

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
so here we go

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
so here we go
so<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> stove<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.410> said

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
so here we are at the stove like I said

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
so here we are at the stove like I said
I<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.920> no<00:01:02.070> idea<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.489> I'm<00:01:02.609> doing<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I have no idea what I'm doing here so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.740 
I have no idea what I'm doing here so
we're<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> start<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:04.650> heat

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
we're going to start with a little heat

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.700 
we're going to start with a little heat
basically<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:06.960> we're<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.530> doing

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
basically what we're going to be doing

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910 
basically what we're going to be doing
is<00:01:08.010> mixing<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.850> sugar<00:01:09.090> with<00:01:09.390> water<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.960> really

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
is mixing the sugar with water a really

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.929 
is mixing the sugar with water a really
really<00:01:11.130> high<00:01:11.250> ratio<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.580> we<00:01:14.580> form<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
really high ratio so that we form a

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969 
really high ratio so that we form a
syrup<00:01:15.299> instead<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.320> water<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.680> gonna<00:01:16.799> use

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
syrup instead of water I'm gonna use

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.490 
syrup instead of water I'm gonna use
coffee<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.600> have<00:01:18.600> no<00:01:18.720> idea<00:01:18.930> how<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.170> sugar<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
coffee I have no idea how much sugar to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
coffee I have no idea how much sugar to
use<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.400> much<00:01:20.520> blood<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.790> want

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
use but I know how much blood I want

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
use but I know how much blood I want
I've<00:01:21.240> owned<00:01:21.330> about<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.570> liter<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> blood<00:01:21.960> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I've owned about a liter of blood so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.429 
I've owned about a liter of blood so
we're<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:26.780> half<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> package<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
we're going to use half that package of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.100 
we're going to use half that package of
sugar<00:01:28.880> awesome<00:01:29.880> kids<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.659> you're<00:01:30.810> doing<00:01:30.930> this

also<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.900> sugar<00:01:37.140> works<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> longer

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
also the way sugar works is the longer

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.100 
also the way sugar works is the longer
you<00:01:37.950> cook<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> harder<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.610> gets

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
you cook it the harder it gets

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
you cook it the harder it gets
although<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> point

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
although we want to get it to the point

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
although we want to get it to the point
where<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> sugar<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.540> dissolved

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
where the sugar is just dissolved

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.980 
where the sugar is just dissolved
because<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.640> way<00:01:44.850> once<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.299> cool<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
because that way once we cool it it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.780 
because that way once we cool it it
won't<00:01:46.200> turn<00:01:46.439> into<00:01:46.560> candy<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:49.490> can<00:01:50.490> tell<00:01:50.640> already

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
won't turn into candy I can tell already

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
won't turn into candy I can tell already
it's<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> judge<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:51.869> thick

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it's going to be hard to judge how thick

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's going to be hard to judge how thick
it<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.280> definitely<00:01:53.700> going<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
it is because it's definitely going to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
it is because it's definitely going to
thicken<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> cools<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.880> gonna

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
thicken when it cools so I'm just gonna

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
thicken when it cools so I'm just gonna
eyeball<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.439> hopefully<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> works<00:02:00.649> I'm

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
eyeball it and hopefully it works I'm

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.380 
eyeball it and hopefully it works I'm
gonna<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> spoon<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.430> test<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> thickness

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
gonna use a spoon to test it thickness

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.410 
gonna use a spoon to test it thickness
in<00:02:03.509> my<00:02:03.600> blood<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:05.420> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
in my blood to see what it's like you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.880

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
can also add chocolate syrup to your

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
can also add chocolate syrup to your
blood<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:09.209> didn't<00:02:09.420> feel<00:02:09.509> like

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
blood I think I just didn't feel like

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
blood I think I just didn't feel like
buying<00:02:09.840> any<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.489> made<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> with

buying any but if you made it with

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.830 
buying any but if you made it with
coffee<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.420> chocolate

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
coffee and chocolate

syrup<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:14.420> corn<00:02:15.420> flour<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.900> thicken<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.200> you'd

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
syrup and corn flour to thicken it you'd

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.559 
syrup and corn flour to thicken it you'd
end<00:02:16.620> up<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:16.800> something<00:02:17.129> that's<00:02:17.569> reasonably

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
end up with something that's reasonably

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
cornstarch chunks out so just by taking

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.240 
cornstarch chunks out so just by taking
some<00:02:49.349> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> syrup<00:02:49.769> out<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.010> letting<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
some of the syrup out and letting it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.640 
some of the syrup out and letting it
cool<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> spoon<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:52.530> see

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
cool on the back of a spoon I can see

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.630 
cool on the back of a spoon I can see
that<00:02:52.769> it's<00:02:52.890> got<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.250> syrupy

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
that it's got a really syrupy

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.240 
that it's got a really syrupy
consistency<00:02:54.380> that's<00:02:55.380> perfect<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.010> think

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
consistency that's perfect I think

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.350 
consistency that's perfect I think
that's<00:02:56.400> excellent<00:02:57.060> for<00:02:57.299> blood<00:02:59.269> tastes<00:03:00.269> pretty

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
that's excellent for blood tastes pretty

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.509 
that's excellent for blood tastes pretty
good<00:03:00.739> but<00:03:01.739> now<00:03:01.799> I'm<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.220> pour<00:03:02.400> out

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.870 
really how blood looks so we're going to
use<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> green<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:47.069> darken<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.519> down<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> bit

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
use the green to darken that down a bit

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.729 
use the green to darken that down a bit
but<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.510> want<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.780> increase<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> richness<00:03:49.349> of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
but I want to increase the richness of

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.550 
but I want to increase the richness of
the<00:03:49.889> red<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.069> bit<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.579> think<00:03:50.819> I'm<00:03:50.910> gonna<00:03:51.560> add

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the red a bit so I think I'm gonna add

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.949 
the red a bit so I think I'm gonna add
another<00:03:52.709> station<00:03:53.099> okay<00:03:53.970> now<00:03:54.299> with<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.690> green

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
another station okay now with the green

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.699 
another station okay now with the green
or<00:03:55.799> blue<00:03:56.340> or<00:03:56.370> whatever<00:03:57.120> you're<00:03:57.480> using<00:03:57.709> we're

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
or blue or whatever you're using we're

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.199 
or blue or whatever you're using we're
going<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.889> be<00:03:58.980> really<00:03:59.310> delicate<00:03:59.489> so<00:03:59.910> I<00:03:59.970> got<00:04:00.120> to

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
going to be really delicate so I got to

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.280 
going to be really delicate so I got to
find<00:04:00.359> some<00:04:00.599> way<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.810> putting<00:04:01.049> this<00:04:01.109> in

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
find some way of putting this in

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.490 
find some way of putting this in
properly<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:03.450> throw<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.169> few<00:04:04.470> drops

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
properly and just throw in a few drops

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.659 
properly and just throw in a few drops
so<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:07.650> darkening<00:04:08.069> down<00:04:08.250> our<00:04:08.400> blood

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
so that's darkening down our blood

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.629 
so that's darkening down our blood
considerably<00:04:09.410> okay<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:10.470> I've<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.430> little

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
considerably okay so I've got a little

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.680 
considerably okay so I've got a little
piece<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.849> white<00:04:11.970> paper<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.299> here<00:04:12.419> we're<00:04:12.569> going

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
piece of white paper in here we're going

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.289 
piece of white paper in here we're going
to<00:04:12.750> test<00:04:12.900> our<00:04:13.079> blood<00:04:13.609> see<00:04:14.609> how<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.760> pans<00:04:14.970> out<00:04:15.150> in

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
to test our blood see how it pans out in

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.120 
to test our blood see how it pans out in
terms<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.630> realism<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.229> still<00:04:16.829> think<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:17.099> a

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
terms of realism I still think it's a

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.390 
terms of realism I still think it's a
little<00:04:17.340> pink

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.740 

I<00:04:22.520> might<00:04:23.520> tweak<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.910> little<00:04:23.940> bit<00:04:24.210> maybe<00:04:24.509> out

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
I might tweak it a little bit maybe out

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.990 
I might tweak it a little bit maybe out
a<00:04:24.780> touch<00:04:25.050> more<00:04:25.259> green<00:04:25.560> but<00:04:25.830> other<00:04:26.699> than<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.910> I

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
a touch more green but other than that I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.520 
a touch more green but other than that I
think<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.389> looks<00:04:27.570> pretty<00:04:27.600> solid<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.169> blunt

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
think that looks pretty solid for blunt

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.469 
think that looks pretty solid for blunt
you<00:04:29.220> can<00:04:29.370> see<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.610> runs<00:04:29.789> pretty<00:04:30.120> nicely<00:04:30.300> for

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
you can see it runs pretty nicely for

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.740 
you can see it runs pretty nicely for
blood<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.060> might<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.300> little<00:04:33.509> bit<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.690> the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
blood so it might be a little bit on the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.060 
blood so it might be a little bit on the
bright<00:04:33.930> side<00:04:33.960> but<00:04:34.350> again<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.590> can<00:04:34.800> just<00:04:34.830> add

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
bright side but again I can just add

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.700 
bright side but again I can just add
more<00:04:35.280> green<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.820> darken<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.240> down<00:04:36.419> and

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
more green to darken that down and

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.659 
more green to darken that down and
that's<00:04:37.710> about<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:38.100> so<00:04:38.490> thanks<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.330> tuning<00:04:39.509> in

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
that's about it so thanks for tuning in

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.100 
that's about it so thanks for tuning in
to<00:04:41.669> give<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.940> recipe<00:04:42.120> again<00:04:42.570> like<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.930> said

I<00:04:43.139> just<00:04:43.380> winged<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:43.889> I<00:04:43.919> think<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.280> used

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
I just winged it but I think I used

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.189 
I just winged it but I think I used
about<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.789> cup<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.210> half<00:04:45.360> of<00:04:45.479> sugar<00:04:46.880> maybe

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
about a cup and a half of sugar maybe

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.110 
about a cup and a half of sugar maybe
three-quarters<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.350> cup<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.680> stale<00:04:50.520> coffee

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
few drops of green and that produced me
