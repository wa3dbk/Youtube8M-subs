00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.250
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 I have my own right here 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 navigation system taught that it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.580
 the whole expenses everything normal 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 speaks by radio to my car radio 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.689
 I can send the frequency here 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.740
 change and adjust and hear that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.939
 get better 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.920
 and I also do that as well 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.019
 Can use handsfree 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.609
 then comes the car radio 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.750
 speakers and that is of course one 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.850
 many times better 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 the rs 60 3d here in the truck version 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.250
 Here we come out and so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.140
 went on navigation you see here as 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 any amount of music video 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 Pictures and so on everything that one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.489
 modern navigation system can live 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 The navigation system is specially designed for 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.460
 Trucks made now what does that have for one 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 The reason for this is clearly heavier trucks 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.129
 Trucks Higher Trucks Higher Trucks Huge Trucks 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.409
 has other speed limits 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.570
 truck needs other stuff that needs 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 Gas stations where he can refuel as a truck 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.820
 may even with tank card and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.430
 All these things are built in here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 So I give my profile one I 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.970
 I have my truck here because I have celebrity 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 is called that is also such a part 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
 that promptly and then too 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.460
 I have the normal functions 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 me in every navigation system 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.220
 find 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.939
 and if I'm here then what do I know 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.950
 Jena must drive again then goal 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.420
 The last goals realized that I can 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.070
 Of course, destinations store routes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.979
 save save targets 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 then all these things I have everything 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.450
 Immediately ready and immediately ready 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.729
 of course I have the whole thing 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 accessories that I need and when we need them 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.450
 look at it that so here once that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.939
 connection cable there is the same time 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.470
 antenna he receives 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.710
 also with its built-in radio 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.960
 receiver also this traffic transmitter 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.579
 and i can send the traffic transmitter 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.259
 then they are being delisted and can do that 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.310
 in the good relations automatically 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.960
 to flow into 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.700
 So if there is a traffic jam somewhere 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 disturbance or what else will that be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.530
 also taken into account yes and then 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.540
 here 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.610
 For what I know what a USB cable 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 So you have the part on the computer to update 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.660
 and similar things to know and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.650
 of course, the support for the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.650
 windshield 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.530
 so everything is important of course 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.380

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.690
 Danger enter what you have for dangerous goods 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.030
