video we're going to ant try and answer
a<00:00:22.290> question<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> get<00:00:23.550> very<00:00:24.090> often<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.689> my

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a question that I get very often in my

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.830 
a question that I get very often in my
classes<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.100> is<00:00:26.480> what's<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> best

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
classes and that is what's the best

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.570 
classes and that is what's the best
camera<00:00:28.410> setting<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.160> doing<00:00:29.340> flash

camera setting for doing flash

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.760 
camera setting for doing flash
photography<00:00:29.820> should<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.750> fully<00:00:31.080> automatic

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
photography should use fully automatic

camera really calculates nothing

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.289

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
proper exposure now here's an area that

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.190 
proper exposure now here's an area that
confuses<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> lot<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.520> people<00:02:04.050> when<00:02:05.050> you're

doing flash photography you are

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.719 
doing flash photography you are
basically<00:02:07.810> using<00:02:08.140> two<00:02:08.560> different<00:02:08.860> exposures

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
basically using two different exposures

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.390

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
check focus and so on it finally came

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.930 
check focus and so on it finally came
out<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:05.740> fact<00:04:05.770> what<00:04:06.190> had<00:04:06.280> happened<00:04:06.670> was

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
very closed down setting so that he

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.950 
very closed down setting so that he

could get as much depth of field as
possible<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:14.710> the<00:04:14.800> shot<00:04:15.010> he<00:04:15.190> was<00:04:15.310> doing<00:04:15.700> and

canon shutter priority mode and here i

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.140 
canon shutter priority mode and here i
was<00:04:55.600> able<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:55.900> set<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.320> shutter<00:04:56.350> at<00:04:56.770> one

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.520 
was able to set the shutter at one
200,000<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.300> i<00:04:58.330> eliminated<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.140> potential

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
200,000 so i eliminated the potential

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
shutter priority is a good choice so

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.780 
shutter priority is a good choice so
there<00:05:25.210> are<00:05:25.500> purposes<00:05:26.500> for<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.890> shutter

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790

there are purposes for the shutter

mode<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:38.460> here<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:39.490> was<00:05:39.700> able<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:39.970> set<00:05:40.210> my

aperture<00:05:40.750> at<00:05:41.080> f4<00:05:41.530> 5<00:05:41.800> which<00:05:42.160> gives<00:05:42.430> me<00:05:42.610> a

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
aperture at f4 5 which gives me a

desirable depth of field in most cases

desirable depth of field in most cases
now<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.330> result<00:05:46.720> was<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.169> camera<00:05:47.530> slowed<00:05:47.740> the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
now the result was the camera slowed the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.240 
now the result was the camera slowed the
shutter<00:05:48.160> down<00:05:48.430> to<00:05:48.760> 1/4<00:05:49.510> of<00:05:49.690> a<00:05:49.990> second<00:05:50.470> because

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
shutter down to 1/4 of a second because

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.909 
shutter down to 1/4 of a second because
it<00:05:51.550> didn't<00:05:51.790> know<00:05:51.910> the<00:05:52.090> flash<00:05:52.330> was<00:05:52.630> coming<00:05:53.050> so
