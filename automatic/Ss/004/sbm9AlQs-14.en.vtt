00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
walls and so that you can have grooves

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.340

that look like this take some baby blue
latex<00:02:51.920> paint<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.430> add<00:02:52.910> some<00:02:53.360> water<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.020> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
latex paint and add some water to it and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.050 
latex paint and add some water to it and
then<00:02:55.370> take<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> sponge<00:02:56.590> dip<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.830> dip<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.610> into

now<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:03.080> can<00:03:03.410> lightly<00:03:03.920> paint<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:04.850> your

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
styrofoam and the paint won't go into

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.250 
styrofoam and the paint won't go into
the<00:03:07.820> grooves<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:08.420> it'll<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.630> give<00:03:09.050> like<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the grooves so it'll just give like a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.290 
the grooves so it'll just give like a
highlight<00:03:09.800> which<00:03:10.100> is<00:03:10.250> exactly<00:03:10.730> what<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.090> want
