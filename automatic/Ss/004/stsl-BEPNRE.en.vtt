the longer lashes here which is kind of

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.729 
the longer lashes here which is kind of
hard<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.690> me<00:03:31.780> because<00:03:31.959> sometimes<00:03:32.110> they<00:03:32.560> go

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
hard for me because sometimes they go

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.590 
hard for me because sometimes they go
all<00:03:32.920> over<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.280> place<00:03:33.459> but<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:34.030> got<00:03:34.150> every

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
all over the place but it got every

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.570 
all over the place but it got every
single<00:03:34.780> lash<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.440> didn't<00:03:36.070> use<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.519> my

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
single lash I didn't use it for my

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.340 
single lash I didn't use it for my
bottom<00:03:36.880> lash<00:03:37.090> because<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.110> really

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
bottom lash because I don't have really

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.560 
bottom lash because I don't have really
a<00:03:38.470> whole<00:03:38.680> lot<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.950> lashes<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:40.030> didn't<00:03:40.390> want

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
a whole lot of lashes and I didn't want

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.039 
a whole lot of lashes and I didn't want
to<00:03:40.690> transfer<00:03:41.230> underneath<00:03:42.840> underneath<00:03:43.840> right

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
to transfer underneath underneath right

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.710 
to transfer underneath underneath right
here<00:03:44.290> because<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.680> tend<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.310> creases<00:03:45.880> but

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
here because I tend to have creases but

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.520
