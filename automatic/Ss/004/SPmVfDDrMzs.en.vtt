00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.539
 delicious good friends we truly grasp 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.760
 and a more or less portion of a bite 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.760
 a snack a paspalos are usually 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.410
 one or two bites that are given to them I go 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.189
 to help you see a little bit of dough 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.449
 they also grab and give at least 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.190
 fear that a little bit now we are going to remove 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.479
 a little bit so it's not so 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.680
 exaggerated 

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.379
 I suspended people who have big mouth 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.290
 what is there, man, they grab me 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.500
 and I've seen myself to pay half and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.549
 he eats it all in one bite 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.440
 well there are even people who 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:52.870
 They eat until the nail and not after 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.820
 like then and present them well 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.210
 if you are going to do this 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.950
 with figures when they 're going to do that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 carrots or apples truth to them right now 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.620
 I'm going to make a carrot here small 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:14.990
 that you do not even though you have no color 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.759
 well in what is added to you 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.479
 they make him a kind of expert and they can 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.590
 do with a knife or with one here 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.320
 is that we use in the part of the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 pastry to give the lines the formites 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.300
 and in the end we always put our 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.770
 our nail 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.950
 there is good and ready to go playing making 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.960
 creating and you know what is it to me 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.270
 I always like to put children to do 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.060
 this they like and when they 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.250
 they participate in something and something more than everything 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 so manual they love them and they 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.590
 they love it and they're going to eat it with more 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.590
 you win and they have the heart 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.649
 If that's where creativity does not have 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.719
 has no limits and another thing friends and 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.030
 friends because I know that the big 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:13.720
 chefs are men 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.810
 when making these passes what 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 that is the milk patita truth I 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.800
 I recommend that you can do it half 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.000
 hour before because you realize that more 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.239
 they are intentional is quick look here is is 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.940
 easy it's fast and it's rich and all the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.800
 people like it then we go to 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.510

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.090
 ingredients of the preparations that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.390
 we have for today good that what 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.220
 we made for today and I hope that 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.750
 they are going to enjoy it in the do and we 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.519
 comment that there is the discount 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.590
 soriano ok let's start with the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.590
 ingredients of our blue gordon is 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.709
 a chicken breast 100 grams of ham 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.190
 100 grams of cheese a cup of bread 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.459
 grated an egg salt pepper to taste and 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.819
 oil for frying the sticks for sewing 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.470
 it's important then I think that 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.510
 it's all very easy, we go with the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.220
 ingredients of the chips good friends 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.550
 for the ingredients to the egg patita 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.270
 and I confirm that they need a can of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.810
 condensed milk 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:21.350
 cups of milk powder one and a half cups 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.570
 of powdered sugar as they saw is 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.570
 white sugar or what they call sugar 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.490
 impalpable or icing sugar can 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.170
 get with any of those names 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.120
 They will also need cloves 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.030
 remember if you want you can use this what 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.580
 what are vegetable colorants please 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.790
 do not forget the differences between toxic 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.080
 and non-toxic that's why it's very important and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.760
 more than everything are our children who 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.800
 we must take care of the clearest we can 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.230
