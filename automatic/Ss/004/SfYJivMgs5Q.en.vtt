00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.010
 they bring you your case which is going to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 solve life so to speak more 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
 of some since good many times we 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.590
 we have found in what we are going to look for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.200
 a new online session either by 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 invitation on and so forth and we 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.410
 we found with the problem this not that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.270
 you will see now below that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.580
 load and load granny this orange 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.290
 of the devil and like I do not do not 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.699
 departure is not until the end 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 After a little while we get a 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.050
 warning message saying that it has 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.850
 exhausted the time to find a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
 session that we go back to gta and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 let's try it again, then something else 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 late you tell us good I tell you you say that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.890
 I do not have all day long 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.960
 despair of many what we do 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.180
 we pay again on the internet we leave the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.700
 game we restart the play we go back to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 enter and we have exactly the same 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.720
 problem then guys I bring you the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 solution and the solution is very simple 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 guys the first thing we're going to have to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 do to correct this fault will be a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 once we are left in the story mode we are going to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.030
 press again start we will go to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 online play gta online and here we go 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 to put on the session that we want 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.050
 center me for example I want a session 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.450
 by invitation 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.570
 so I'll leave the cursor let's say the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 market here well marked and I'll go to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 my console menu I'm in 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.870
 playstation3 but it works with any 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.020
 kind of console worth guys so if 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.160
 you are in 360 xbox one playstation 4 os 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 will work the same 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.390
 this method so once we're here 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.220
 in the menu we will close session without any 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.350
 problem you will see here in the background that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.570
 has closed the session we have to go back 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 to start then we start again guys 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.800
 we just start as you are seeing 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.140
 and you will see that we are marked by the menu 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.970
 before but this time like a little 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.490
 off not in gray as we will say another 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.520
 Once a gta online we will give a session in 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.740
 my case by invitation we will accept everything 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 this puts us and now guys and yes 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.280
 that has to let us in without 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.840
 no type of problems because 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.150
 you will see that now the orange circle 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
 Well, how will it turn white? 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.110
 is the one that the important one is not the one that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.720
 will allow you log in to the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.250
 that we want is worth so guys I hope 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.020

 I think that they have 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.570
 there have been many, at least I've 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.560
 had since good this is very annoying 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.930
 not to be turning off 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
 with sun to leave the game and good and not 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.620
 find a solution then here guys 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.209
