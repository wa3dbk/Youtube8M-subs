hope so we can pull this stuff off for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
hope so we can pull this stuff off for
the<00:00:35.790> winter<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.090> they'll<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.510> more<00:00:36.690> compact

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the winter and they'll be more compact

the winter and they'll be more compact
which<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.860> means<00:00:38.070> they'll<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.309> able<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> stay

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

and<00:01:57.630> may<00:01:57.750> lose<00:01:57.929> a<00:01:58.049> few<00:01:58.259> now<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.310> for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and may lose a few now but I think for

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.160 
and may lose a few now but I think for
the<00:01:59.700> overall<00:02:00.000> health<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> colony<00:02:01.020> it's

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the overall health with a colony it's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.779 
the overall health with a colony it's
important<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.039> all<00:02:02.159> go<00:02:02.340> back<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
important that they all go back down to

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.499 
important that they all go back down to
the<00:02:02.969> bottom<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.579> that's<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.789> now<00:02:06.060> I'm<00:02:06.299> just
