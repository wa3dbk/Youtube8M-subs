 Hello, friends, how are we? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.900
 I bring here a pretty tweet 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.549
 interesting and it's called you that's pedro 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.089
 with this tweet we will be able to control 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.880
 the animations of our device and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.009
 well we found it in the ajax repo 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.739
 so well let's start fast 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.250
 we can see that opening multitasking sale 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:31.550
 very very slowly if for example I open 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 cydia the animations are super slow 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.890
 yes i open dreamboard 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.090
 we can see that the animations come 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.340
 very very slow 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.310
 and good as we can put the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.820
 slow animations we can put the 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.250
 super-fast animations doing that 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:58.180
 an effect that our device is going 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.730
 very quickly we can see that the effect is 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.129
 that our device goes super fast 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 well we talk a game we are going to put this 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.850
 game for example takes away 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.720
 completely the animation if we put 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.320
 catch to fold and given also that is us 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.070
 leaves without animations and this makes the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 effect is super fast making 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.320
 our iphone ipod touch or ipad go 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.360
 very fast 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.490
 ok you can see that it changes a lot 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.539
 animations good but practically not 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.670
 we have animations here I was reading 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.280
 we can see that it is very fast 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.190
 we put back 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.400
 and good friends this is what this 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 if you want to give an effect or 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.520
 share your stuff saying that it's going very 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.100
 fast your device you can do it 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.190
 without any problem with this since in 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.500
 truth changes a lot everything we are 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.300
 used to seeing doing that our 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.840
 device go to a certain point more 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.880
 fast since our animations are 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.520
 they are left without animations 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.679
 practically everything is going very very very fast 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.250
