00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that I flushed the entire system with a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
that I flushed the entire system with a
flush<00:01:08.220> resolver<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> removed<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
flush resolver and then I removed the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
flush resolver and then I removed the
thermostat<00:01:10.650> that's<00:01:11.220> when<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> added<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
thermostat that's when I added the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
thermostat that's when I added the
distilled<00:01:12.420> water<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.650> steel<00:01:13.920> seal<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
distilled water and the steel seal and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
distilled water and the steel seal and
I'm<00:01:14.610> gonna<00:01:14.729> let<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.970> run<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.720> days

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I'm gonna let it run for about two days

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'm gonna let it run for about two days
and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> probably<00:01:17.270> reflash

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and then I'm going to probably reflash

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
and then I'm going to probably reflash
the<00:01:18.299> system<00:01:18.750> again<00:01:19.049> that's<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.590> its

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the system again that's as its

the system again that's as its
recommended<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.299> put<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.930> 50/50

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
recommended and then put in the 50/50

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.140 
recommended and then put in the 50/50
