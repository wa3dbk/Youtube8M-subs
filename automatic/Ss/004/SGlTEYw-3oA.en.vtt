here again with custom pc review and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.099 
here again with custom pc review and
today<00:00:05.850> i'm<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.480> doing<00:00:06.629> another

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
today i'm going to be doing another

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.040 
today i'm going to be doing another
video<00:00:07.470> unboxing<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.460> guys<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.050> today's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
video unboxing for you guys and today's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.720 
video unboxing for you guys and today's
video<00:00:10.380> unboxing<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> be<00:00:11.370> on<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> cpu

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
video unboxing is going to be on a cpu

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
video unboxing is going to be on a cpu
cooler<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:13.080> cpu<00:00:13.469> cooler<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.920> none<00:00:14.370> other

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
cooler and this cpu cooler is none other

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.890 
cooler and this cpu cooler is none other
than<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.179> noctua<00:00:16.130> NHC<00:00:17.130> 14<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.869> of

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
than the noctua NHC 14 so this is one of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.490 
than the noctua NHC 14 so this is one of
not<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.529> us<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.980> highest<00:00:20.850> n<00:00:21.060> cpu<00:00:21.539> coolers<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
not to us a highest n cpu coolers it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
not to us a highest n cpu coolers it
uses<00:00:22.830> dual<00:00:23.869> 140<00:00:24.869> millimeter<00:00:25.730> NFP<00:00:26.730> 14<00:00:27.240> flx<00:00:27.869> fans

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
uses dual 140 millimeter NFP 14 flx fans

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.179 
uses dual 140 millimeter NFP 14 flx fans
so<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.789> top<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> line<00:00:31.189> 140

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so that's one of the top of the line 140

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.750 
so that's one of the top of the line 140
millimeter<00:00:32.579> fans<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.660> noctua<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.610> also

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
millimeter fans by noctua and it also

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
millimeter fans by noctua and it also
has<00:00:35.910> AC<00:00:36.270> shape<00:00:36.660> design<00:00:36.930> as<00:00:37.410> you've<00:00:37.649> probably

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
has AC shape design as you've probably

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619 
has AC shape design as you've probably
seen<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> pictures<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
seen from some of the pictures on the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.520 
seen from some of the pictures on the
box<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.640> that<00:00:41.640> means<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.149> cooler<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.140> going

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
box and that means the cooler is going

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
box and that means the cooler is going
to<00:00:43.710> wear<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.460> least<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> heatsink<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to wear at least the heatsink and the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290 
to wear at least the heatsink and the
fans<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> run<00:00:46.969> parallel<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fans are going to run parallel to the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.119 
fans are going to run parallel to the
motherboard<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.530> allows

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
motherboard and what that does is allows

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
motherboard and what that does is allows
the<00:00:50.460> fans<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.239> blow<00:00:51.539> air<00:00:52.230> onto<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the fans to blow air onto the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.430 
the fans to blow air onto the
motherboard<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.660> course<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.350> all

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
motherboard and of course as you all

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
motherboard and of course as you all
know<00:00:55.469> moving<00:00:56.010> additional<00:00:56.520> air<00:00:56.699> onto<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> more

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
know moving additional air onto the more

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
know moving additional air onto the more
bored<00:00:57.570> causes<00:00:58.440> incidental<00:00:59.070> airflow<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bored causes incidental airflow to the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.090 
bored causes incidental airflow to the
vrm<00:01:00.539> area<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.460> RAM<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.359> everything

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
vrm area to the RAM and everything

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.240 
vrm area to the RAM and everything
causing<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.489> run<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.210> cooler<00:01:07.250> alright

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
causing them to run a bit cooler alright

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
causing them to run a bit cooler alright
guys<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.760> inside<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> box<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.350> get

going to contain the entire cooler

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.070 
going to contain the entire cooler
assembly<00:01:19.200> itself<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> accessory<00:01:21.900> box

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
assembly itself so in the accessory box

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
assembly itself so in the accessory box
first<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.549> label<00:01:24.180> package

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
first thing you get is a label package

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.899 
first thing you get is a label package
for<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.229> AMD<00:01:26.159> set<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:28.520> really<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.729> this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
for the AMD set and I really like this

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.539 
for the AMD set and I really like this
the<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> does<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the how not to a does this because you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.130 
the how not to a does this because you
know<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.790> always<00:01:32.939> label<00:01:33.479> their<00:01:33.630> packages

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
know they always label their packages

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
know they always label their packages
which<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.500> very<00:01:34.770> nice<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.909> one's<00:01:36.119> going

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
which is very nice so that one's going

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
which is very nice so that one's going
to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> NHC<00:01:37.200> 14<00:01:37.650> common<00:01:38.070> part<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.520> these

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to be the NHC 14 common part so these

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.929 
to be the NHC 14 common part so these
are<00:01:38.909> common<00:01:39.270> parts<00:01:39.570> coming<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.140> both<00:01:41.040> AMD<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
are common parts coming to both AMD and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.649 
are common parts coming to both AMD and
intel<00:01:42.540> motherboards<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.360> next<00:01:45.360> thing<00:01:45.509> you're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
intel motherboards and next thing you're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.520 
intel motherboards and next thing you're
going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.490> probably<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
going to get is probably the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.210 
going to get is probably the
II Intel<00:01:49.159> set<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.420> well<00:01:51.409> there<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.799> is<00:01:51.890> there's

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
II Intel set so well there it is there's

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.899 
II Intel set so well there it is there's
a<00:01:52.310> user's<00:01:53.090> manual<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.570> there<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.130> i<00:01:55.130> kind<00:01:55.670> of

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
a user's manual in there and i kind of

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.670 
a user's manual in there and i kind of
like<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.270> user's<00:01:56.630> manual<00:01:56.990> because<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.560> know

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
like this user's manual because you know

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.649 
like this user's manual because you know
it's<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.250> really<00:01:58.580> clearly<00:01:58.970> labeled<00:01:59.450> which

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
it's it's really clearly labeled which

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.510 
it's it's really clearly labeled which
side<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.320> Intel<00:02:00.680> side<00:02:00.920> which<00:02:01.130> side<00:02:01.159> of<00:02:01.400> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
side is the Intel side which side of the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.899 
side is the Intel side which side of the
AMD<00:02:02.000> side<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.740> know<00:02:03.860> from<00:02:04.310> past

case you're having trouble with it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.530 
case you're having trouble with it
you're<00:02:18.680> probably<00:02:18.890> not<00:02:19.100> going<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.459> but<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.390> in

you're probably not going to but just in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.100 
you're probably not going to but just in
case<00:02:20.570> there<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.160> also<00:02:22.310> get<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.110> support

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
case there it is you also get a support

bar<00:02:24.320> for<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.860> c14<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.239> because<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.690> a

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
bar for this c14 you know because it's a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.000 
bar for this c14 you know because it's a
large<00:02:26.959> cooler<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.680> mounted

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
large cooler it's kind of mounted

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.280 
large cooler it's kind of mounted
sideways<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.790> different<00:02:29.450> orientation<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
sideways in a different orientation so

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.009 
sideways in a different orientation so
that's<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:32.060> also<00:02:32.180> get<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.420> screwdriver

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
that's that you also get a screwdriver

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.430 
that's that you also get a screwdriver
it<00:02:33.410> looks<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.760> Phillips<00:02:34.760> head<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.930> if<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
it looks like a Phillips head so if you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.500 
it looks like a Phillips head so if you
don't<00:02:36.560> have<00:02:36.769> one<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:37.130> those<00:02:37.280> knocks<00:02:38.269> what

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
don't have one of those knocks what

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.120 
don't have one of those knocks what
includes<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.989> because<00:02:39.350> they<00:02:39.530> are<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
includes it because they are just that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.270 
includes it because they are just that
thoughtful<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.870> also<00:02:42.110> get<00:02:42.260> an<00:02:42.470> Intel<00:02:42.860> set<00:02:43.130> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
thoughtful you also get an Intel set of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.390 
thoughtful you also get an Intel set of
course<00:02:43.900> because<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.500> would<00:02:45.650> suck<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.069> just

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
course because it would suck if you just

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.890 
course because it would suck if you just
got<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.819> AMD<00:02:47.480> set<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.700> course<00:02:50.030> that's<00:02:50.480> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
got the AMD set and of course that's it

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.990 
got the AMD set and of course that's it
for<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.650> box<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.190> we're<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.640> drop

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
for that box so we're just going to drop

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.479 
for that box so we're just going to drop
everything<00:02:53.480> into<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.590> little<00:02:54.769> cover<00:02:55.160> right

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
everything into that little cover right

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.460 
everything into that little cover right
there<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.940> then<00:02:56.150> we'll<00:02:56.390> take<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.600> look<00:02:56.930> at<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
there and then we'll take a look at the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.610 
there and then we'll take a look at the
cpu<00:02:57.920> cooler<00:02:58.220> itself<00:02:58.810> alright<00:02:59.810> so<00:02:59.989> opening<00:03:00.530> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
cpu cooler itself alright so opening the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860 
cpu cooler itself alright so opening the
box<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.190> actually<00:03:01.579> have<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.970> pretty<00:03:02.540> good<00:03:02.630> idea

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
box you actually have a pretty good idea

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.390 
box you actually have a pretty good idea
of<00:03:03.549> why<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.610> cpu<00:03:05.510> cooler<00:03:06.380> box<00:03:06.590> is<00:03:06.860> actually<00:03:07.220> so

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
of why the cpu cooler box is actually so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.000 
of why the cpu cooler box is actually so
big<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.880> um<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:09.079> reason<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.709> is

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
big and um the reason for that is

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.310 
big and um the reason for that is
because<00:03:10.040> well<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.120> unique<00:03:11.510> design<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
because well the unique design of the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.830 
because well the unique design of the
cpu<00:03:12.709> cooler<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.880> c-shape<00:03:14.329> actually

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
cpu cooler the c-shape actually

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.800 
cpu cooler the c-shape actually
necessitates<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.730> actually<00:03:17.570> build<00:03:17.690> a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
necessitates you to actually build a

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.949 
necessitates you to actually build a
pretty<00:03:18.049> big<00:03:18.230> box<00:03:18.470> for<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.070> um<00:03:19.630> we'll<00:03:20.630> kind

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
pretty big box for this so um we'll kind

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.080 
pretty big box for this so um we'll kind
of<00:03:21.019> pull<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:21.410> out<00:03:21.530> real<00:03:21.950> quick<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.430> take<00:03:23.060> a

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
of pull it out real quick and take a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.890 
of pull it out real quick and take a
look<00:03:23.299> at<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.920> interesting

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
look at it and one of the interesting

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.229 
look at it and one of the interesting
things<00:03:26.900> about<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.320> cpu<00:03:27.709> cooler<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.609> the

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
things about the cpu cooler is that the

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.020 
things about the cpu cooler is that the
cpu<00:03:29.989> fans<00:03:30.290> are<00:03:30.470> actually<00:03:30.890> pre-mounted<00:03:31.489> i<00:03:31.940> know

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
cpu fans are actually pre-mounted i know

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.220 
cpu fans are actually pre-mounted i know
most<00:03:33.310> cpu<00:03:34.310> cooler<00:03:34.730> companies<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.450> know<00:03:35.570> guys

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
most cpu cooler companies you know guys

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.560 
most cpu cooler companies you know guys
who<00:03:36.290> design<00:03:36.859> cpu<00:03:37.760> coolers<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.269> things<00:03:38.420> like

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
who design cpu coolers and things like

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.410 
who design cpu coolers and things like
that<00:03:38.630> they<00:03:39.440> never<00:03:39.859> really<00:03:40.190> melt<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.910> fans<00:03:41.150> for

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
that they never really melt the fans for

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.230 
that they never really melt the fans for
you<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.690> that's<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.079> an<00:03:42.290> extra<00:03:42.920> step<00:03:43.250> here

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
you so that's just an extra step here

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.400 
you so that's just an extra step here
you<00:03:44.510> don't<00:03:44.690> really<00:03:44.780> have<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.050> do<00:03:45.230> so

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
you don't really have to do so

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.130 
you don't really have to do so
definitely<00:03:45.860> props<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.730> noctua<00:03:47.630> for<00:03:47.900> doing

that I really like that um also we'll go

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.710 
that I really like that um also we'll go
check<00:03:52.100> out<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.550> bottom<00:03:53.000> here<00:03:53.210> it's<00:03:53.420> it's

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
check out the bottom here it's it's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.870 
check out the bottom here it's it's
actually<00:03:54.080> very<00:03:54.110> nicely<00:03:54.800> machine<00:03:55.400> down<00:03:55.610> here

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
actually very nicely machine down here

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.690 
actually very nicely machine down here
so<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:56.690> see<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.410> reflection<00:03:57.980> is

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
so you can see just that reflection is

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.480 
so you can see just that reflection is
absolutely<00:03:59.450> beautiful<00:03:59.630> and<00:04:00.290> also<00:04:01.040> at<00:04:01.340> the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
absolutely beautiful and also at the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.390 
absolutely beautiful and also at the
bottom<00:04:01.850> here<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.180> also<00:04:02.420> see<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.620> has<00:04:03.650> six

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
bottom here we also see that it has six

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.040 
bottom here we also see that it has six
heat<00:04:04.670> pipes<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:06.550> heat<00:04:07.550> pipes<00:04:07.820> look<00:04:08.630> fairly

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
heat pipes and heat pipes look fairly

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.170 
heat pipes and heat pipes look fairly
thick<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:09.800> they<00:04:09.980> should<00:04:10.220> conduct<00:04:10.700> heat<00:04:11.150> very

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
thick so they should conduct heat very

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.860 
thick so they should conduct heat very
well<00:04:11.710> the<00:04:12.710> fans<00:04:12.950> unfortunately<00:04:13.670> are<00:04:13.850> not<00:04:13.910> PWM

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
well the fans unfortunately are not PWM

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.670 
well the fans unfortunately are not PWM
control<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.560> so<00:04:15.710> they<00:04:15.950> are<00:04:16.130> three<00:04:16.970> pin<00:04:17.680> fan

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
control and so they are three pin fan

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.010 
control and so they are three pin fan
connectors<00:04:19.250> however<00:04:20.090> these<00:04:20.270> are<00:04:20.540> one<00:04:20.840> hundred

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
connectors however these are one hundred

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.560 
connectors however these are one hundred
and<00:04:21.230> forty<00:04:21.620> millimeter<00:04:22.010> fans<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.330> means

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
and forty millimeter fans so that means

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.950 
and forty millimeter fans so that means
they<00:04:23.870> should<00:04:24.170> run<00:04:24.500> fairly<00:04:25.310> silent<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.870> know

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
they should run fairly silent you know

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.380 
they should run fairly silent you know
in<00:04:27.140> addition<00:04:27.380> these<00:04:28.070> are<00:04:28.340> not<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.730> a<00:04:28.760> fan<00:04:29.060> so

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
in addition these are not to a fan so

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.590 
in addition these are not to a fan so
they<00:04:29.630> are<00:04:29.840> usually<00:04:30.080> silent<00:04:30.560> anyways<00:04:31.600> and

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
they are usually silent anyways and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.360 
they are usually silent anyways and
they'll<00:04:33.410> also<00:04:33.650> include<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.730> low-speed<00:04:35.450> adapter

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
they'll also include a low-speed adapter

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.590 
they'll also include a low-speed adapter
just<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.490> case<00:04:37.640> they're<00:04:37.700> not<00:04:38.000> silent<00:04:38.360> enough

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
just in case they're not silent enough

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.050 
just in case they're not silent enough
however<00:04:39.470> as<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.920> all<00:04:40.280> know<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.820> will

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
however as you all know that will

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.970 
however as you all know that will
probably<00:04:41.360> reduce<00:04:41.750> performance<00:04:42.110> by<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.680> little

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
probably reduce performance by a little

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.720 
probably reduce performance by a little
bit<00:04:43.100> so<00:04:43.820> definitely<00:04:44.390> keep<00:04:44.720> that<00:04:44.750> in<00:04:44.990> mind

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
bit so definitely keep that in mind

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.910 
bit so definitely keep that in mind
otherwise<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:47.540> should<00:04:48.200> be<00:04:48.470> pretty<00:04:48.770> much

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
otherwise that should be pretty much

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.070 
otherwise that should be pretty much
everything<00:04:49.730> there<00:04:49.760> is<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.420> CPU<00:04:50.780> cooler

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
everything there is to the CPU cooler

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.140 
everything there is to the CPU cooler
obviously<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.890> can<00:04:52.100> remove<00:04:52.460> either<00:04:52.730> one<00:04:53.120> or

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
obviously you can remove either one or

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.510 
obviously you can remove either one or
the<00:04:53.330> other<00:04:53.480> of<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.960> fans<00:04:54.200> in<00:04:54.800> case<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.400> know

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
the other of the fans in case you know

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.820 
the other of the fans in case you know
this<00:04:55.880> thing<00:04:56.090> doesn't<00:04:56.420> fit<00:04:56.630> in<00:04:56.840> your<00:04:57.380> case<00:04:57.680> or

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
this thing doesn't fit in your case or

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.160 
this thing doesn't fit in your case or
anything<00:04:58.160> like<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:58.850> otherwise<00:04:59.780> that's

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
anything like that but otherwise that's

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.870 
anything like that but otherwise that's
all<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.380> really<00:05:00.590> have<00:05:00.710> for<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.190> I've<00:05:01.460> got
