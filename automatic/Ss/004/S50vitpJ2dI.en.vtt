00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
about the nexus 5 first off is the
battery<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:28.289> didn't<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.949> babby<00:00:29.160> size

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
battery we didn't like the babby size

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
battery we didn't like the babby size
and<00:00:29.970> also<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.810> didn't<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> fact<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
and also we didn't like the fact that it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
and also we didn't like the fact that it
wasn't<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> replaceable<00:00:33.420> battery<00:00:33.860> combined<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
wasn't a replaceable battery combined a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
wasn't a replaceable battery combined a
couple<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.370> things<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.110> battery<00:00:37.110> life

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
couple of things there so battery life

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.479 
couple of things there so battery life
itself<00:00:37.820> was<00:00:38.820> okay<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.899> 12<00:00:40.170> hours<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.739> as

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
itself was okay as about 12 hours but as

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
itself was okay as about 12 hours but as
a<00:00:41.550> power<00:00:41.879> user<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.230> doesn't<00:00:43.410> last<00:00:43.620> me

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a power user this thing doesn't last me

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.709 
a power user this thing doesn't last me
the<00:00:43.860> whole<00:00:44.070> day<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.489> still<00:00:44.910> need<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.210> charge<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the whole day I still need to charge it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
the whole day I still need to charge it
so<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.440> thing<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.680> didn't<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so that is one thing I didn't like and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
so that is one thing I didn't like and
also<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.579> cannot<00:00:48.000> replace<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> battery<00:00:48.840> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
also I cannot replace the battery so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
also I cannot replace the battery so
even<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.920> wanted<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> bigger<00:00:50.550> battery

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
even if I wanted to get a bigger battery

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.689 
even if I wanted to get a bigger battery
that<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.600> possible<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> nexus<00:00:53.309> 5<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that is not possible with the nexus 5 so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
that is not possible with the nexus 5 so
that's<00:00:53.850> something<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.350> didn't<00:00:55.620> like

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that's something that we didn't like

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639 
that's something that we didn't like
here<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> number<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.260> second

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
here now going to number two the second

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.880 
here now going to number two the second
thing<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.969> microSD<00:01:00.629> expansion<00:01:00.989> yes<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
thing is no microSD expansion yes you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
thing is no microSD expansion yes you
can<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> nexus<00:01:02.670> 5<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.210> 16<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.809> 32<00:01:04.199> dy

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
can get the nexus 5 it's 16 or 32 dy

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.969 
can get the nexus 5 it's 16 or 32 dy
variants<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.070> also<00:01:06.560> google<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.680> trying<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
variants and also google was trying to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
variants and also google was trying to
cut<00:01:08.130> down<00:01:08.159> costs<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.880> i<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.540> kept<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
cut down costs but i think if we kept it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
cut down costs but i think if we kept it
a<00:01:09.990> 16<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> give<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> option<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a 16 and give you the option with a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
a 16 and give you the option with a
microSD<00:01:12.900> expansion<00:01:13.280> that'll<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.400> much<00:01:14.610> better

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
microSD expansion that'll be much better

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
microSD expansion that'll be much better
for<00:01:14.939> me<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.810> actually<00:01:15.840> store<00:01:16.470> more<00:01:16.830> on

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
for me and I can actually store more on

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240 
for me and I can actually store more on
my<00:01:17.400> device<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.229> instead<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> me

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
my device and you know instead of me

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
my device and you know instead of me
just<00:01:20.280> picking<00:01:20.759> between<00:01:20.880> 16<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> 32gb<00:01:22.049> variant

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
just picking between 16 and 32gb variant

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.140

optimized for lower memory usage which

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.040 
optimized for lower memory usage which
means<00:03:38.040> i<00:03:38.280> should<00:03:38.459> be<00:03:38.880> using<00:03:39.000> less<00:03:39.300> memory<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
means i should be using less memory and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.440 
means i should be using less memory and
