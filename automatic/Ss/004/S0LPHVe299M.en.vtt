about<00:00:40.469> 20<00:00:40.739> years<00:00:40.860> ago<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.219> moved<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> something

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
about 20 years ago we moved to something

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.369 
about 20 years ago we moved to something
called<00:00:41.940> Harrington<00:00:42.420> rod<00:00:42.600> instrumentation

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
called Harrington rod instrumentation

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.760 
called Harrington rod instrumentation
which<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.950> single<00:00:44.670> rod<00:00:44.930> that<00:00:45.930> would

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
which is a single rod that would

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
which is a single rod that would
straighten<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> spine<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.750> though

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
straighten the spine and even though

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
straighten the spine and even though
it's<00:00:49.050> straining<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> spine<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.520> see

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it's straining out the spine you can see

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
it's straining out the spine you can see
that<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> takes<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.289> curvature<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that it takes out the curvature in the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
that it takes out the curvature in the
past<00:00:53.430> several<00:00:53.670> years<00:00:53.789> we've<00:00:54.510> developed

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
past several years we've developed

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
past several years we've developed
pedicle<00:00:55.739> screw<00:00:56.039> instrumentation<00:00:56.730> techniques

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pedicle screw instrumentation techniques

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
pedicle screw instrumentation techniques
which<00:00:57.210> allow<00:00:57.480> us<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> keep<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> natural

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
which allow us to keep the natural

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
which allow us to keep the natural
contour<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.090> remaining<00:01:00.510> problem<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
remained is that there was severe

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.530

it looks like before-and-after let's

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
it looks like before-and-after let's
pull<00:01:43.350> these<00:01:43.530> x-rays<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> show<00:01:45.299> us<00:01:45.420> what

pull these x-rays up and show us what

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
pull these x-rays up and show us what
we're<00:01:45.720> seeing<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.399> actually

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we're seeing here say these are actually

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.330 
we're seeing here say these are actually
pages<00:01:48.360> before<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.810> after<00:01:49.079> yes<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.130> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pages before and after yes can see in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
pages before and after yes can see in
the<00:01:50.729> chest<00:01:51.000> region<00:01:51.180> she<00:01:51.479> has<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> significant

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the chest region she has a significant

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
the chest region she has a significant
curve<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.189> then<00:01:53.840> postoperatively<00:01:54.840> in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
curve and then postoperatively in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.170 
curve and then postoperatively in
surgery<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> rods<00:01:56.460> have

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
surgery you can see that the rods have

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.300 
surgery you can see that the rods have
brought<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> curve<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.500> take<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> made<00:01:59.159> it

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
brought this curve and take and made it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.429 
brought this curve and take and made it
straight<00:01:59.610> does<00:01:59.880> everyone<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> can

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
straight does everyone see that can

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
straight does everyone see that can
everyone<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.909> gonna<00:02:03.000> quickly<00:02:03.270> show

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
everyone I'm just gonna quickly show

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.440 
everyone I'm just gonna quickly show
everyone<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.710> her<00:02:05.070> spine<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.180> see

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
everyone this is her spine you all see

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.969 
everyone this is her spine you all see
that

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.800 
that
that's<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.280> normal<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.420> now<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that's not normal and so now it is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500 
that's not normal and so now it is
straight<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.670> again<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
straight but that is you know again this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.880 
straight but that is you know again this
is<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.989> conducive<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is not conducive to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
is not conducive to
a<00:02:13.920> normal<00:02:15.800> life<00:02:16.800> normal<00:02:17.520> activities<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.480> it's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
a normal life normal activities and it's

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.140 
a normal life normal activities and it's
amazing<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.170> able<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.350> take<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.890> and

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
amazing you're able to take that and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.820 
amazing you're able to take that and
straighten<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.240> out<00:02:21.390> absolutely<00:02:22.380> scoliosis

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
straighten it out absolutely scoliosis

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.120 
straighten it out absolutely scoliosis
itself<00:02:23.550> causes<00:02:23.910> many<00:02:24.090> problems<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
itself causes many problems for the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.040 
itself causes many problems for the
people<00:02:26.130> who<00:02:26.370> suffer<00:02:26.730> from<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
people who suffer from it one of the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.510 
people who suffer from it one of the
obvious<00:02:28.230> ones<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.950> see<00:02:29.130> from<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
obvious ones as you can see from the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.640 
obvious ones as you can see from the
x-rays<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.570> works<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.380> chest

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
x-rays is because it works the chest

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.110 
x-rays is because it works the chest
region<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.550> spine

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
region of the spine

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.790 
region of the spine
it<00:02:33.360> gives<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.780> difficulty<00:02:34.320> breathing<00:02:34.530> they

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it gives them difficulty breathing they

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.890 
it gives them difficulty breathing they
have<00:02:34.920> trouble<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.370> athletics<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.180> lot<00:02:36.810> of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
have trouble with athletics a lot of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.410 
have trouble with athletics a lot of
them<00:02:37.050> become<00:02:37.350> pretty<00:02:37.860> thin<00:02:38.160> because<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
them become pretty thin because as it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.390 
them become pretty thin because as it
becomes<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.080> more<00:02:40.170> bent<00:02:40.530> their<00:02:41.160> chest

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
becomes more and more bent their chest

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.970 
becomes more and more bent their chest
portion<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.270> takes<00:02:42.540> up<00:02:42.720> more<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.140> more<00:02:43.319> energy

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
portion it takes up more and more energy

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.540 
portion it takes up more and more energy
just<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.400> keep<00:02:44.640> breathing<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:47.220> usually

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
just to keep breathing and so usually

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.699 
just to keep breathing and so usually
when<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.760> correct<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:49.020> takes<00:02:49.260> away<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.500> lot

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
when you correct it it takes away a lot

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.020 
when you correct it it takes away a lot
of<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> pain<00:02:50.100> issues<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.580> they<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
of the pain issues that they have it

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
of the pain issues that they have it
takes<00:02:51.180> away<00:02:51.330> their<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.600> energy<00:02:51.989> problems<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
takes away their are energy problems and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.050 
takes away their are energy problems and
fatigue<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.100> they've<00:02:53.250> been<00:02:53.370> suffering<00:02:53.670> from

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
fatigue that they've been suffering from

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.420 
fatigue that they've been suffering from
and<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:55.260> course<00:02:55.560> there's<00:02:55.739> also<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> body

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and of course there's also the body

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.150 
and of course there's also the body
image<00:02:57.290> aspects<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:58.830> so

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
image aspects of it as well so

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.890 
image aspects of it as well so
mechanical<00:02:59.940> issues<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.300> let's<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.600> minimize

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
mechanical issues but let's not minimize

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.780 
mechanical issues but let's not minimize
the<00:03:01.380> body<00:03:01.590> image<00:03:01.860> issues<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.610> some

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the body image issues you have some

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.250 
the body image issues you have some
before<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.150> afters<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> before

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
and after a page but I want to show

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.710 
and after a page but I want to show
people<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.150> again<00:03:06.420> you're<00:03:06.600> talking

people this because again you're talking

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
people this because again you're talking
about<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.050> body<00:03:07.350> image<00:03:07.800> where<00:03:08.400> you're<00:03:08.550> taking

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
about a body image where you're taking

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.820 
about a body image where you're taking
someone<00:03:09.150> from<00:03:09.330> really<00:03:09.810> an<00:03:10.080> abnormal

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
someone from really an abnormal

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.590 
someone from really an abnormal
curvature<00:03:10.980> -<00:03:11.430> yeah<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.330> really

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
curvature - yeah that's really

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.130 
curvature - yeah that's really
impressive<00:03:13.670> absolutely<00:03:14.670> these<00:03:15.510> patients<00:03:16.019> are

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
impressive absolutely these patients are

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.530 
impressive absolutely these patients are
all<00:03:16.320> six<00:03:16.709> weeks<00:03:16.950> out<00:03:17.160> from<00:03:17.190> surgery<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.150> this

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
all six weeks out from surgery so this

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.990 
all six weeks out from surgery so this
shows<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:20.160> girls<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.549> do<00:03:20.670> very<00:03:20.940> very

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
shows that the girls can do very very

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390 
shows that the girls can do very very
well<00:03:21.239> even<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:22.049> early<00:03:22.500> as<00:03:22.709> six<00:03:23.040> weeks<00:03:23.100> out<00:03:23.370> from

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
well even as early as six weeks out from

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400 
well even as early as six weeks out from
surgery<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.360> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.810> from<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.230> back

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
surgery and you can see from the back

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.199 
surgery and you can see from the back
just<00:03:25.440> from<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.010> contours<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.760> shadows

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
just from the contours and the shadows

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.080 
just from the contours and the shadows

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
that it's a lot more symmetric than it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.580 
that it's a lot more symmetric than it
used<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.510> before<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.959> surgery<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
used to be before the surgery and that

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.460 
used to be before the surgery and that
shows<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.549> not<00:03:33.390> only<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.959> corrected

shows that not only have you corrected

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.380 
shows that not only have you corrected
the<00:03:34.650> curvature<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.820> scoliosis<00:03:36.090> we've

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
the curvature of the scoliosis we've

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.180 
the curvature of the scoliosis we've
also<00:03:36.600> corrected<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.110> rotational<00:03:37.739> component

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
also corrected the rotational component

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.220 
also corrected the rotational component
well<00:03:38.280> Paige<00:03:38.489> if<00:03:38.760> you're<00:03:38.910> watching<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.959> better
