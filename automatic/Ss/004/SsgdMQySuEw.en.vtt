00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.400
 that there are boys and girls we are facing a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.920
 game that does not need web presentation or 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.349
 so everyone will know this 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.140
 classic game the pacman but good 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.759
 We are with the feet 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.950
 championship edition with my english 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.830
 walk around the house and there they have the names 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.199
 that I really do not know because I already 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.210
 have disappeared we're going to look a little 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.730
 what's the good of going 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.220
 everything we know is not a kind of 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.640
 Pacman remix with another type of game 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.860
 it's not the classic pacman with different 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.450
 mode types championship mode as of 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.190
 simple 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.190
 we are going to see a championship mode 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:58.300
 come for him 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.300
 but with a little music and progress 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.420
 being here and the truth is that a little 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.250
 different because 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.250
 where are the other points 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.060
 I look like three woke up 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.509
 here the quiet little guy is worth it now 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.509
 to you 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.049
 as complicated and the truth is that you 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.049
 throws a lot to my liking 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.790
 to see if I can make a good game 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.840
 not so fast not now 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.909
 come I am going from spells 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:57.740
 no no no but I understand 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.329
 baccalaureate games nothing more 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.630
 as those who most 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.630
 and you 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 and fast though 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.470
 and then the truth is that it's different already 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.060
 that in the classic pacman was catching 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.290
 the points and if I took all the points 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.980
 okay 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.980
 how 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.180
 no meals all points 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:39.110
 good to look at the other moment modes 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.450
 to play the same thing we have to play 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.000
 championship let's play in extra mode 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.000
 let's say also for the minutes 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.820
 well now 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.340
 as we said of magic's fast 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.340
 but why 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.710
 that's faster than it seems 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.740
 they are graphics 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.360
 to every time since it's a game that are 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.940
 the movements do not have much 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.520
 with much to give green visibility 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.800
 to make the game a masterpiece 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.490
 since it is a masterpiece this game is 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.860
 a classic and let's go is its gameplay what 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.930
 what stands out most as in most 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.200
 games that I like is their 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.360
 playability the parakeets is the least and 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.300
 I think I'll leave it here for the video 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.190
 it's been a short cork with cork let's go 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.280
 to leave bookmarks prizes to see the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.840
 awards if someone is interested is like 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.379
 a kind of achievement to leave 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.860
 that also game is for the ps3 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.500
 is a mini game is not a game of these 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.690
 you have to download it from the app store or 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.129
 good from other sources that do not see 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.549
 names that since we are all very 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.549
 older and we already know where they got 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.549
 games 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.890
 this is another way 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.140
 appearing and a little electric 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.799
 then the sound was me under 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.340
 I also 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:45.319
 but good is the same since I think that 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.039
 the map does not change and nothing already does 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.039
 almost from memory 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 I think this has been all I hope that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.790
 they have liked to vote 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.180
 I do not know what you want is negative 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.180
 like 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.470
 but the most important thing is that you do not take 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.470
 drug
