00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
a power line 200 watt power inverter arm

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.410 
a power line 200 watt power inverter arm
and<00:03:00.049> we<00:03:01.049> use<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.500> each<00:03:01.799> car<00:03:02.129> because<00:03:02.879> the

regular cigarette lighter Jack's just
don't<00:03:08.310> work<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.609> well<00:03:09.230> for<00:03:10.230> powering<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
don't work that well for powering the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.199 
don't work that well for powering the
tablet<00:03:11.069> it<00:03:11.129> has<00:03:11.159> a<00:03:11.250> big<00:03:11.489> screen<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.000> when<00:03:12.090> it's
