to stand on a table and you'll have to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080 
to stand on a table and you'll have to
get<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.009> used<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> footprint<00:01:50.909> here

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
a full Windows 8 laptop now is it worth

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.440 
a full Windows 8 laptop now is it worth
the<00:02:52.600> money<00:02:52.989> well<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.739> think<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
the money well I think that this is a

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.690 
the money well I think that this is a
fantastically<00:02:56.350> designed<00:02:56.650> package<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.430> think

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
fantastically designed package I think

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.729 
fantastically designed package I think
that<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.180> lot<00:02:58.450> of<00:02:58.510> fun<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.989> use<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.470> type

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
that it's a lot of fun to use this type

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.830 
that it's a lot of fun to use this type
cover<00:03:00.010> or<00:03:00.280> touch<00:03:00.550> covers<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.120> case<00:03:01.300> may<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.510> I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
cover or touch covers the case may be I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.810 
cover or touch covers the case may be I
think<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.769> definitely<00:03:03.130> proves<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.580> point

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
think it definitely proves the point

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.600 
think it definitely proves the point
that<00:03:04.300> tablets<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.290> be<00:03:05.320> used<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:06.070> computers

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
that tablets can be used like computers

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.160 
that tablets can be used like computers
especially<00:03:07.209> when<00:03:07.570> they<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:07.750> peripherals

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
especially when they have peripherals

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.990 
especially when they have peripherals
that<00:03:08.260> are<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:08.680> smart<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.580> price<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.820> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that are this smart but the price is a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.070 
that are this smart but the price is a
little<00:03:10.090> high<00:03:10.360> when<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.720> look<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:10.989> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
little high when you look at the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
little high when you look at the
landscape<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.070> an<00:03:12.160> ultrabook<00:03:12.489> right<00:03:12.820> now

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
landscape you get an ultrabook right now
