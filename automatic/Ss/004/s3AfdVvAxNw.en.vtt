00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi I'm Jonathan flag here I've been

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.670 
hi I'm Jonathan flag here I've been
doing<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> lot<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.659> experiments<00:00:04.290> with<00:00:04.319> frying

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
doing a lot of experiments with frying

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.130 
doing a lot of experiments with frying
on<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.040> bobcat<00:00:05.549> system<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.600> may<00:00:06.690> wonder<00:00:06.899> why

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
on a bobcat system you may wonder why

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.290 
on a bobcat system you may wonder why
why<00:00:07.589> would<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:07.799> even<00:00:08.010> take<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.309> pan<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:09.059> this

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
why would you even take a pan like this

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.499 
why would you even take a pan like this
this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.889> 10<00:00:10.889> ounces<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> handle<00:00:12.179> you'll

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
this is 10 ounces with a handle you'll

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.690 
this is 10 ounces with a handle you'll
probably<00:00:12.599> reduce<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.259> down<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.650> 8<00:00:14.160> ounces<00:00:14.549> or

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
probably reduce it down to 8 ounces or

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
probably reduce it down to 8 ounces or
so<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> work<00:00:16.049> well<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.619> couple<00:00:17.100> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
so it's a lot of work well a couple of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
so it's a lot of work well a couple of
reasons<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> impress<00:00:18.660> your

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
reasons one if you want to impress your

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.810 
reasons one if you want to impress your
