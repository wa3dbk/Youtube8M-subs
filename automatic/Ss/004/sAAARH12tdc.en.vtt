makeup look and it's just using one
eyeshadow<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:05.040> I'd<00:00:05.190> recommend<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:06.120> use<00:00:06.569> a

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
eyeshadow now I'd recommend to use a

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.440 
eyeshadow now I'd recommend to use a
shimmery<00:00:07.500> shadow<00:00:07.830> as<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.639> has<00:00:08.790> lots<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.120> colors

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
shimmery shadow as it has lots of colors

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.089 
shimmery shadow as it has lots of colors
within<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> eyeshadow<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
within the eyeshadow and it's going to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
within the eyeshadow and it's going to
give<00:00:11.309> depth<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.150> definition<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> makeup

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259

your<00:00:42.300> eyeshadow<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.050> choice<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:43.800> using<00:00:44.129> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
your eyeshadow of choice I'm using this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.209 
your eyeshadow of choice I'm using this
kind<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.850> topi<00:00:45.239> Brian<00:00:45.510> shade<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.649> said<00:00:46.920> try

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
kind of topi Brian shade like I said try

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
kind of topi Brian shade like I said try
and<00:00:47.370> pick<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.670> an<00:00:47.789> eyeshadow<00:00:48.149> that's<00:00:48.390> shimmery

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and pick up an eyeshadow that's shimmery

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.229 
and pick up an eyeshadow that's shimmery
because<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.010> already<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.520> different

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
because this will already have different

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689 
because this will already have different
flecks<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.840> color<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> makes<00:00:53.579> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
flecks of color in it so it makes it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.549 
flecks of color in it so it makes it
much<00:00:53.820> easier<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.600> give<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.140> depth<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
much easier to give some depth and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
much easier to give some depth and
definition<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> eye<00:00:56.460> makeup<00:00:56.789> look<00:00:57.120> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
definition to the eye makeup look so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.510 
definition to the eye makeup look so
once<00:00:58.320> you've<00:00:58.469> applied<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> color<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.489> over

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520

into the crease area now I'm just

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.830 
into the crease area now I'm just
picking<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> bit<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:21.119> eye<00:01:21.150> shadow<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
picking up a bit more eye shadow on a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
picking up a bit more eye shadow on a
fluffy<00:01:22.140> blending<00:01:22.500> brush<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.610> blending

fluffy blending brush and I'm blending

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
fluffy blending brush and I'm blending
this<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.479> into<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> crease<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> eye<00:01:25.470> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this right into the crease of the eye so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
this right into the crease of the eye so
I'm<00:01:26.909> using<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.420> line<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.990> well<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> guide

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I'm using that line as well as a guide

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.890 
I'm using that line as well as a guide
which<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.040> why<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> tend<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> use<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.570> kind<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
which is why I tend to use this kind of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.679 
which is why I tend to use this kind of
I<00:01:31.049> shape<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.979> easier<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> apply<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
I shape I think it's easier to apply and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.469 
I shape I think it's easier to apply and
blend<00:01:33.840> my<00:01:34.229> shadows<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.340> take<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.820> clean

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
blend my shadows then take a clean

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
blend my shadows then take a clean
blending<00:01:36.689> brush<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.500> buff<00:01:37.710> along<00:01:37.979> those

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
blending brush and just buff along those

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580 
blending brush and just buff along those
edges<00:01:38.600> now<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.780> I've<00:01:39.900> done<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.560> have
