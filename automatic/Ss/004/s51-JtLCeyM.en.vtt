00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
where the level of water is and they'll

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
where the level of water is and they'll
trip<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> off<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.040> time<00:01:26.280> now<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> see

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
trip it off when it's time now you see

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.170 
trip it off when it's time now you see

so you take a look here you can see how
it<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:52.020> around<00:01:52.290> you'd<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.490> 360

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it is all around you'd be a little 360

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.109 
it is all around you'd be a little 360
tour<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.169 

and<00:01:59.659> he<00:01:59.719> comes<00:01:59.929> all<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.320> way<00:02:00.350> down<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
and he comes all the way down and that

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.539 
and he comes all the way down and that
will<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.780> super<00:02:03.500> super<00:02:04.039> clean<00:02:04.939> up<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.859> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
will just super super clean up the the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.270 
will just super super clean up the the
tea<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:08.149> compost<00:02:08.660> tea<00:02:08.899> out<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.349> their<00:02:09.560> come

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
tea that compost tea out of their come

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.059 
tea that compost tea out of their come
down<00:02:10.550> we'll<00:02:11.239> get<00:02:11.420> an<00:02:11.569> airbrake<00:02:12.050> she'll<00:02:12.709> stop

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
down we'll get an airbrake she'll stop

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.979 
down we'll get an airbrake she'll stop
and<00:02:13.519> then<00:02:13.760> chill<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.180> start<00:02:14.480> filling<00:02:14.750> all

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
and then chill just start filling all

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.559 
and then chill just start filling all
the<00:02:15.349> way<00:02:15.440> back<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:15.860> again<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.120> will<00:02:17.269> wash

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the way back up again and it will wash

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.589 
the way back up again and it will wash
all<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:17.989> compost<00:02:18.920> tea<00:02:19.250> out<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.330> bag

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
all that compost tea out of that bag

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.890 
all that compost tea out of that bag
into<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.500> water<00:02:21.709> into<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.519> digestible

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
into the water into a digestible

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.320 
into the water into a digestible
solution<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.129> our<00:02:25.370> garbage<00:02:25.970> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
solution so this is our garbage to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.280 
solution so this is our garbage to
aquaponics

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
aquaponics

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.170

by<00:02:27.620> taking<00:02:27.830> garbage<00:02:28.280> feeding<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.060> the

by taking garbage feeding it to the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.479 
by taking garbage feeding it to the
worms<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.410> have<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> worm<00:02:30.860> casting

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
worms and then we have the worm casting

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.910 
worms and then we have the worm casting
goes<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.060> by<00:02:32.660> having<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:33.049> simple<00:02:33.440> little<00:02:33.590> bag

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
goes here by having a simple little bag

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.580 
goes here by having a simple little bag
like<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:35.420> bubbling<00:02:35.989> over<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.349> water

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
like this that bubbling over the water

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.550 
like this that bubbling over the water
there<00:02:36.920> we'll<00:02:37.610> just<00:02:37.640> work<00:02:38.060> fantastic<00:02:38.959> we're

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
there we'll just work fantastic we're

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.050 
there we'll just work fantastic we're

here in the green hose that goes into a
two-inch<00:03:13.310> pipe<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.120> lift<00:03:14.359> this<00:03:14.569> up

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
two-inch pipe and I can lift this up

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.809 
two-inch pipe and I can lift this up
that's<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.349> completely<00:03:15.799> separate<00:03:16.280> pipe<00:03:16.519> there

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
that's a completely separate pipe there

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.449 
that's a completely separate pipe there
it<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:17.930> sitting<00:03:18.380> inside<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.099> 3-inch

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
it is just sitting inside the 3-inch

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.789 
it is just sitting inside the 3-inch
pipe<00:03:19.639> this<00:03:19.880> capped<00:03:20.209> at<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> bottom<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.620> this

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
pipe this capped at the bottom so this

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.680 
pipe this capped at the bottom so this
