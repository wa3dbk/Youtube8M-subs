00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.350
 I even have some items such as 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.399
 uranium and plutonium at certain 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.020
 conditions break up every time they become 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.889
 silver makes neighbors as well 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.789
 disintegrate in the same way 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.059
 it's called chain reaction 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.889
 during the reaction, small 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.719
 particles that have enormous 

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.769
 energy reserve particles collide 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.769
 each other and get very hot 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.919
 it all happens inside the reactor 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.839
 nuclear power plant 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.379
 the heat received is hardly transformed here 

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.640
 electricity 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.610
 getting electricity one of 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.790
 main ways to use and there 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150
 energy 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.120
 some nuclear power plants in Russia 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 besides the elite number produces energy 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.070
 for residential heating 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.690
 nuclear power is developing rapidly in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.520
 the whole world 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.970
 thanks to nuclear energy 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.790
 moving nuclear icebreakers and 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.150
 submarines 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.730
 on special research 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.910
 research experiments are conducted in reactors 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.400
 conventional power plants 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.700
 working on coal and fuel oil and strongly 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.090
 polluting nature and electricity 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.230
 not so much is produced 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.370
 nuclear energy more efficiently and 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 safely 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.210
 where nuclear power plants 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.690
 getting bigger than usual 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.700
 ecological situation 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 nuclear power plant is not improving 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 ejects Sasha and app. 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.170
 uranium fuel for nuclear 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.870
 power plants are inexpensive and the very 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.270
 the station has high power during 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.240
 reactor runtime decays only 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360
 part of the plan and the remaining fuel can 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.110
 use again therefore 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020
 the energy produced is obtained 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.550
 cheap if you take two tanks of fuel oil 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.619
 or two large cars of coal from them 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.110
 enough to get as much 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.740
 How much electricity is produced 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 only language on vodka Logoram uranium 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.310
 world uranium reserves are 30 times more 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.390
 silver and a thousand times more gold reserves 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.120
 with half of all uranium 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.070
 concentrated in three countries 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.680
 Australia Kazakhstan and Canada 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 scientists have calculated that uranium and plutonium 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.850
 enough for about a hundred years 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.720
 but vatan these reactors can also 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.659
 use thorium its enough for 300 or 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 even 400 years 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.939
 moreover, it is under development 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.090
 such methods of burning uranium 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.359
 that would stretch the current 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.239
 reserves for several thousand years
