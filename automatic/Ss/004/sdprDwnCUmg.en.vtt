would not recommend getting these

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.150 
would not recommend getting these
because<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> base<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.300> pretty<00:03:09.750> low<00:03:09.990> like<00:03:10.890> even

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
because the base is pretty low like even

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.830 
because the base is pretty low like even
if<00:03:11.250> you're<00:03:11.370> playing<00:03:11.520> games<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.150> want<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.480> hear

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
if you're playing games you want to hear

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.670 
if you're playing games you want to hear
the<00:03:13.110> grenade<00:03:13.440> exploding<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.380> listen<00:03:16.650> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
the grenade exploding if you listen to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.190 
the grenade exploding if you listen to
rock<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.160> stuff<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:18.150> highs<00:03:18.360> are<00:03:18.390> very<00:03:18.900> high

rock and stuff the highs are very high

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.900 
rock and stuff the highs are very high

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
so it's going to sound a little better

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.390 
so it's going to sound a little better
on<00:03:21.180> your<00:03:21.780> iPod<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:22.140> iPhone<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.890> could<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.190> bass
