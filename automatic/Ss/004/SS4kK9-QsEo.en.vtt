00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
can get for the black widow keyboard for

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
can get for the black widow keyboard for
the<00:00:23.820> blue<00:00:24.060> switches<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:25.920> those<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.099> you

who don't know a lot of the Razer
keyboards<00:00:28.980> come<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.490> these<00:00:30.330> blue<00:00:30.660> switches

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
keyboards come with these blue switches

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.520

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
just show you a way of how you can

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.959 
just show you a way of how you can
customize<00:00:47.309> your<00:00:48.090> blue<00:00:48.629> switches<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.850> just<00:00:50.850> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
customize your blue switches and just to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
customize your blue switches and just to
make<00:00:51.120> them<00:00:51.300> quieter<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> stop

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
make them quieter you know just to stop

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.040 
make them quieter you know just to stop
them<00:00:53.370> bottoming<00:00:53.969> out<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.510> touching<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
them bottoming out so touching the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.510 
them bottoming out so touching the
bottom<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> board<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> actual

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
bottom of the board of the actual

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990 
bottom of the board of the actual
keyboard<00:00:57.559> very<00:00:58.559> cheap<00:00:58.949> modification<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
keyboard very cheap modification you can

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
keyboard very cheap modification you can
actually<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> pay<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> equivalent

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
actually do and you pay the equivalent

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
actually do and you pay the equivalent
of<00:01:02.730> 10<00:01:02.969> pound<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.899> something<00:01:04.739> like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of 10 pound which was something like

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.020 
of 10 pound which was something like
five<00:01:05.189> dollars<00:01:05.460> us<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.070> mean<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
five dollars us and I mean when you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
five dollars us and I mean when you
consider<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.320> noise<00:01:10.530> reduction<00:01:10.950> at

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
consider you know the noise reduction at

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
consider you know the noise reduction at
my<00:01:11.520> time<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.299> people<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.720> sleeping

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
my time you know if people are sleeping

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
my time you know if people are sleeping
they'll<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.619> smashing<00:01:14.189> keys<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
they'll be smashing keys out and you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.950 
they'll be smashing keys out and you
know<00:01:16.140> keeping<00:01:16.500> everybody<00:01:16.890> awake<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.960> can

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
know keeping everybody awake but I can

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
know keeping everybody awake but I can
show<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> comparison<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.310> far<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
show you a comparison so far so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
show you a comparison so far so
essentially<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.750> these<00:01:22.170> small<00:01:22.530> black

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
essentially you have these small black

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.760 
essentially you have these small black
rings<00:01:23.869> hopefully<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
rings hopefully you can see that and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.810 
rings hopefully you can see that and
quite<00:01:26.640> simply<00:01:27.650> that's<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> inside<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
quite simply that's just the inside of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.050 
quite simply that's just the inside of
the<00:01:29.939> key<00:01:30.180> itself<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.880> literally<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.030> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the key itself and literally you just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.039 
the key itself and literally you just
fit<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> ring<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.920> pry<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:36.049> both

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
fit the ring so you just pry over both

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.090 
fit the ring so you just pry over both
your<00:01:37.079> thumbs<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.650> without

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
your thumbs get over without

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.620 
your thumbs get over without
looking<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> an<00:01:42.119> idiot<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
looking like to much of an idiot and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.139 
looking like to much of an idiot and
even<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.920> slightly<00:01:44.250> would<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:44.850> over

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
even if you just slightly would get over

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
even if you just slightly would get over
onto<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> key<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> actually<00:01:46.950> push<00:01:47.340> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
onto the key when you actually push it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.870 
onto the key when you actually push it
down<00:01:47.729> onto<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.210> key<00:01:48.420> afterward<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.490> know

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
down onto the key afterward and you know

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.039 
down onto the key afterward and you know
you<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.180> notice<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:53.130> noise<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
you actually notice that the noise is

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.880 
you actually notice that the noise is
significantly<00:01:55.700> quieter<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> moment

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
significantly quieter so at the moment

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.690 
significantly quieter so at the moment
all<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.189> macro<00:01:59.640> keys<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.270> our<00:02:00.570> rings<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.200> them

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
all my macro keys have our rings on them

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.340 
all my macro keys have our rings on them
so<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.149> hear<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.020> might<00:02:04.200> be

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
so as you can hear that you might be

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.450 
so as you can hear that you might be
sitting<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.649> thinking<00:02:04.829> oh<00:02:05.130> well<00:02:05.310> that's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
sitting there thinking oh well that's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.020 
sitting there thinking oh well that's
released<00:02:05.880> quite<00:02:06.600> still<00:02:06.960> noisy<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:08.759> when<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
released quite still noisy but when you

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.340 
released quite still noisy but when you
compare

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.980 

that's<00:02:12.350> one<00:02:12.590> without<00:02:12.830> an<00:02:13.160> o-ring<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.870> then

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
that's one without an o-ring and then

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.280
