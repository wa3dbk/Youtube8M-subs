00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:15.150
 I will start by separating but side 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.029
 and the top and to be able to well 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 fasteners and so I separated my neck 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:32.420
 and I turn my hair into actually 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.850
 a fake banana and I my disciples 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 so we get all the hair up to the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 middle of the head and going towards 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.629
 before and especially do not hesitate to create 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.730
 the front to do something 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.730
 more convex well in banana 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.620
 we will start by creating a little bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.239
 the side and I'm going to rock my hair 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.100
 so on the left side I pancake 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.009
 slightly it's just to give a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.490
 matter neither hair nor who does it like 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:20.880
 I have a help that is well placed a 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 little lacquer and I put passes 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.470
 so now I will resume 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.549
 all my hair is that was 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:40.940
 tipped in this left side and I'm going 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:43.220
 start my banana aside so 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.360
 I continue to pull my hair up 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.530
 the side I take so pins to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.799
 bun so I create my mass in front 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 to be able to position well and and in 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.520
 to make a banana one refines with a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.220
 pin to a fignon we do not want some 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.320
 thing too sharp but still 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.320
 is this rock side 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.810
 we will start by doing a 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.790
 banana in patches all sides and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:33.350
 the back counts here we read all the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:36.200
 hair so we put the forceps for good 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.760
 maintain his leader I'll take everything 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.310
 the other side always the same I read my 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 hair so on brings the hair well 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.769
 the tongs and I roll them for 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.840
 train my banana 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:59.209
 so the top I pancake crepe at 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:04.730
 maximum but I was not to relocate 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.560
 the sharks dishes rep and to which we 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.959
 so we made materials 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.140
 different a matter lice to a 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.650
 disheveled styled material for more 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.650
 contrast
