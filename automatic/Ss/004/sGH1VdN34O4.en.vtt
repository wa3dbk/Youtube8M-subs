00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
reasons why Rakesh actually asked me to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.980 
reasons why Rakesh actually asked me to
do<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> film

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
do the film

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.160 
do the film
I've<00:02:22.950> known<00:02:23.160> Rakesh<00:02:23.490> for<00:02:23.670> very<00:02:23.880> long<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.170> he

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
I've known Rakesh for very long so he

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.410 
I've known Rakesh for very long so he
knew<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.380> I'd<00:02:25.680> spent<00:02:25.980> close<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.820> 10<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.150> 11

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
knew that I'd spent close to 10 to 11

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.600 
knew that I'd spent close to 10 to 11
years<00:02:27.570> abroad<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:28.710> childhood<00:02:29.040> too<00:02:29.430> broad

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
years abroad in my childhood too broad

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.340 
years abroad in my childhood too broad
so<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:29.850> he<00:02:30.150> he<00:02:30.720> felt<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.140> would

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so I think he he felt that I would

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.000 
so I think he he felt that I would
understand<00:02:32.510> washin<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.720> would<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.770> able<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
understand washin and would be able to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.340 
understand washin and would be able to
relate<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.490> fact<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.240> he<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:37.050> feel

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
relate to the fact of how he would feel

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.960 
relate to the fact of how he would feel
out<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> place<00:02:38.960> in<00:02:39.960> Delhi<00:02:40.320> six<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.460> so
