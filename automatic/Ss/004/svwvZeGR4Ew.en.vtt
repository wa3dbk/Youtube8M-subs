00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.660
 big crash with my grandpa and that is 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.639
 the hottest thing there is without joke me 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.150
 like these maps and with this level 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.130
 no idea here I do not know if 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.480
 I do not have any I go to this 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.279
 map with this sniper and then it runs 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 actually again what I wanted to say 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.609
 it is again a week ago by a 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.740
 video made this time it was because 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.190
 I had films with black ops 2 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.780
 but without joke that that 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.400
 can you stand him the game that i do 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.380
 So I can not do that at all 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.760
 Clear and the people are so rude 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:58.929
 the community is so take a look 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 a good one here and what he is doing right now 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.370
 I've seen that in every game 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.830
 and that's why I agree 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.570
 decided not to follow films 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.040
 i am very sorry i had 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.540
 actually it's over 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.759
 not and if I live something 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 comment on the game so you go 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.299
 he has only 23 seconds reaction time 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.820
 Cuckoo Koke and before you shot down 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.500
 will or sun and you have to say there 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.200
 There is not so much right now 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.969
 to comment live 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.860
 and I would like to join me too 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.490
 entertain a few people or something and so 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.329
 that may be so 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.189
 edited together 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.320
 but the people I met yes 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.610
 they've been insulting for a long time and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 that is boring too that is 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.569
 boring consistently offended 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:50.759
 and that's why I am now 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:54.039
 decided against 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.200
 euro to play this game 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.000
 yes and now we are up here again 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.649
 the map big crash on the way what wanted 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.939
 I still say 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.929
 As compensation for that, I just 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.659
 again full of inactivity rays 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.829
 So I can say an excuse 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.880
 One day I could not get there 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.829
 I come to a chair and then I have 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.030
 the assembled and I can you 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:19.569
 now a short excerpt 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:23.560
 show a smart here yes and the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.060
 Study is pretty cool 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.459
 I think one of the most cut 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.230
 battle vs videos of me doing well the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.349
 want to have said first then then 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.900
 have you heard the excuses right away? 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.040
 And what is there really big? 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.209
 to say oh so yes exactly as 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 Compensation for that I am now 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.049
 had so much to do and so will I. 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.519
 pretty much complete at 9000 subscribers 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.359
 special because we are learning now 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.359
 the 9000 subscribers 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.570
 we call ourselves the 9000 subscribers and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.990
 I actually had at 1000 2000 before 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.580
 3000 4000 5000 7500 10.000 subscribers in 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.140
 special but I thought 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.560
 come on then you just do it now 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.360
 one at 9000 and 10,000 me 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.940
 believe there you will become so 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.770
 now none of you hopefully interfere 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.780
 and yes what is a ten new gameplay 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.240
 is mio now I'm not allowed anymore 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 die so now I'm me 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.730
 wants to concentrate 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.530
 Well , it gets a little bit scarcer 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.620
 it works but it works but i pretty much 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.360
 Well, really , whenever I play gameplays 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.770
 make a comment and live comment that is 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.690
 really live here 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.260
 I'll jump now I'll see myself 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 everything looks live live to the back 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.800
 because it really works on the stove 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.520
 really every second time I do it 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.670
 works great shit now 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.590
 Now please relinquish please position 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.070
 explode 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.650
 no no that would even be no that would 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.110
 look so horny and I do not have 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.580
 you hit how cool would that be 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.980
 now if we have our one 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.870
 death on the mac is actually running 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.780
 Master it's easy is easy 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.010
 pretty cool I'm rather that is 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.300
 even my favorite even now 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:19.260
 for victory village now prefer 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:22.010
 but hardly Walter Passmann 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.600
 that is not working at all anymore 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:33.020
 holistically concerted, may i use them 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.020

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.230
 my car falls to me but what me 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.620
 It is not necessary to tell you 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.910
 more so many enemies are not serious 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.450
 Now this is going to be a spot here 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.450

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:00.110
 I messed up the score I have him 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.920
 almost a bitter moment for the bitter 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.920
