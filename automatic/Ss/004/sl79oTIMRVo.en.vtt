00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
the fairly large box obviously the clues

00:01:49.069 --> 00:02:11.760 
the fairly large box obviously the clues

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.660 

because<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.890> doesn't<00:02:13.100> get<00:02:13.280> better<00:02:13.460> than<00:02:13.610> that

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
because it doesn't get better than that

the old distant one where you had the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.820 
the old distant one where you had the
