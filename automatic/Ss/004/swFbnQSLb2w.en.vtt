that<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.240> captured<00:01:32.750> as<00:01:32.869> much<00:01:33.049> data<00:01:33.290> as<00:01:33.409> they

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
that they captured as much data as they

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.370 
that they captured as much data as they
could<00:01:33.890> from<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.340> beta<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.079> game<00:01:36.229> in

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
could from the beta so that the game in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.600 
could from the beta so that the game in
general<00:01:36.500> could<00:01:36.799> just<00:01:37.009> be<00:01:37.100> better<00:01:37.250> which<00:01:37.579> is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
general could just be better which is

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.060 
general could just be better which is
you<00:01:38.090> know<00:01:38.119> what<00:01:38.360> we<00:01:38.479> would<00:01:38.630> assume<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
you know what we would assume is the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.069 
you know what we would assume is the
reason<00:01:40.399> for<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.700> delay<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:41.719> those<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.020> who

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
reason for a delay but those of you who

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:43.600 
reason for a delay but those of you who
didn't<00:01:42.380> know<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:42.649> ahead<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.920> time<00:01:43.039> Mass

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
quarter of 2012 so that is a for sure

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.679 
sure being pushed to 2012 but they're
hinting<00:01:56.539> at<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:56.990> possibility<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.149> would

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
hinting at the possibility so I would

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.950 
hinting at the possibility so I would
say<00:01:59.840> don't<00:02:00.020> expect<00:02:00.680> it<00:02:01.030> until<00:02:02.030> 2012<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:02.869> that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
say don't expect it until 2012 and that

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.240 
say don't expect it until 2012 and that
way<00:02:03.079> if<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.289> comes<00:02:03.439> out<00:02:03.530> early<00:02:03.890> it'll<00:02:04.070> be<00:02:04.219> a

the<00:03:09.800> franchise<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.459> general<00:03:10.940> would<00:03:11.090> have<00:03:11.270> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
the franchise in general would have a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.970 
the franchise in general would have a
better<00:03:11.480> reputation<00:03:11.900> amongst<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.770> gamer

better reputation amongst the gamer

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.850 
better reputation amongst the gamer

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
and i am a little bit disappointed that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.350

sounds like it's going to be the type of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.910 
sounds like it's going to be the type of
game<00:03:25.459> where<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.910> switch<00:03:26.299> from<00:03:27.049> easy<00:03:27.560> to

the PSN of the pc world for sony that
also<00:04:10.070> got<00:04:10.280> hacked<00:04:10.549> into<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.360> now<00:04:11.480> Sony's<00:04:12.019> being

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
also got hacked into so now Sony's being

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.920 
also got hacked into so now Sony's being
subpoenaed<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:14.360> they're<00:04:14.570> going<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> look

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
subpoenaed and they're going to look

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.770 
subpoenaed and they're going to look
into<00:04:15.380> what<00:04:16.280> they<00:04:16.459> promised<00:04:16.970> their<00:04:17.120> consumers

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
into what they promised their consumers

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.870 
into what they promised their consumers
as<00:04:18.019> opposed<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> what<00:04:18.919> their<00:04:19.220> consumers<00:04:19.669> got

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
as opposed to what their consumers got

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.960 
as opposed to what their consumers got
and<00:04:20.180> whether<00:04:20.840> or<00:04:20.930> not<00:04:21.200> they<00:04:21.680> were<00:04:21.979> distrustful

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
and whether or not they were distrustful

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.300 
and whether or not they were distrustful
and<00:04:23.300> lied<00:04:23.750> about<00:04:24.020> their<00:04:24.440> security<00:04:25.039> measures

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
and lied about their security measures

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.590 
and lied about their security measures
so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.930 
so
that<00:04:26.720> should<00:04:26.960> be<00:04:27.200> very<00:04:27.890> interesting<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.580> keep

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
that should be very interesting to keep

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.430 
that should be very interesting to keep
track<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.300> they're<00:04:29.630> calling<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.990> consumer

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
track of they're calling it a consumer

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.440 
track of they're calling it a consumer
protection<00:04:30.920> inquiry<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:32.000> it'll<00:04:32.300> basically

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
protection inquiry so it'll basically

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.210 
protection inquiry so it'll basically
just<00:04:32.870> be<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.260> them<00:04:33.530> looking<00:04:33.950> at<00:04:34.070> their
