00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.740
 Today I'm going to show you how to do these 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.800
 five designs of harvest for Christmas that 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.330
 They are super easy and super cute 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.250
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.860
 paint our units I'm going to leave 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 a link here so you can see how 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.329
 this is done is super easy and there is already a 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.369
 video on the channel if you want to know 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.380
 the first one that I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.100
 this little tree with the two that is 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.650
 precious and we're going to need painting 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.620
 green ribbon of his little belts 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.230
 some ornaments of a star and a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.780
 dark base and then yes that is leader and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.970
 these countries to put balls and those 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.370
 things and good first thing we're going to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.860
 to do is to paint our nails in this 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.110
 case I chose this as I paint and it looks 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 super cute let's let it dry 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
 Now let's do this to take it 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.810
 as it hits the course to the tape and that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
 we are going to stretch all the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.680
 enamel and let's do as a guy 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.680
 something like that in the nail 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.350
 and now what we are going to do when 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.659
 are you trying to expose like crazy 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.540
 things no matter how you want to put it is 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.130
 like me you're going to how to give it and we're going to 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 put the green paint on top 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.119
 very careful not to be 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.680
 plucking or nothing but you stay 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.439
 well stuck so you could not get it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 the paint above and will water 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.240
 just dry those that are not totally 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.740
 dry and you will start it if you see that you 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.659
 they are hollow as it happened to me simply 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.479
 you fill it and now we're going to decorate it 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.509
 with the pinturitas that we had with 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.549
 balls and the star you want to put and 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.549
 we only add our top and now 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.940
 m 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.750
 for that what we are going to occupy is appointment 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.900
 scissors and a dark enamel and one more 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.690
 expand milestone let's cut tapes in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.960
 different sizes and we will do the same 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.970
 the same put a little triangle and now what 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.920
 what we are going to do is cut in half 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.480
 one of these bits and you have to 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 stay these little ones is very 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.520
 important that you have your digits for 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.570
 form as in the figurine of the tree of 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.980
 Christmas as they are seeing they have to 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.140
 form with the tapes to be able to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 then paint it where you are sure 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.970
 you can give some layers with the paint that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.040
 you want is super mega easy we can 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.260
 take a little bit either 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.560
 completely dry and we will remove the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.560
 ribbons 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.720
 then if you want you can add 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.910
 maybe just put the leader in the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.940
 part the little tree after the top coat and 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.940
 Free around and super super easy 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.769
 now what we are going to need enamel 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.370
 blue for the base and then we will occupy 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.310
 this white paint leader and this is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.650
 so for like sticks or poles and so on 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 let's paint and find the layers create 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.500
 you need, let's start 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.480
 making three sticks from a corner one 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.859
 in the middle not for meter below and 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.109
 those sticks have to go out 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.549
 others like a little bit younger 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.129
 it's already how you want to do it 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.799
 you need an exact pattern you can see a 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.930
 drawing or something like that but the joke is like 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.180
 the three sticks are leaving 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.120
 more and if you have your nails a lot more 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.190
 long is better because you can fit 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.139
 better and if you can make the lines more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.060
 finitas would also be much easier 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.250
 because to me the truth was enough 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.930
 thick and apart on the nails to me I do not 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.450
 like others is not so long then no 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.040
 It fits also but good is something like that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.189
 you can accommodate he puts the 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.189
 exlÃ­der above and the top coat and ready 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.080
 all right 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.040
 This is the most beautiful and it's mega easy 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.000
 occupy a dark enamel of leader this 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.830
 or diamond top coat and all that good 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.419
 let's paint it and then the glaze 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.270
 transparent we will only put it 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.040
 on the tip and we're going to take the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.280
 diamond over and we will remove the 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.919
 excess and then we put the top coat and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.990
 it is already as you see it is the easiest 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.530
 Super nice and elegant world and I 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.530
 love 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.500
 for this we are going to paint our nail 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.780
 green color and let's do as the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.610
 little balls that the tree has and we're going to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.560
 put what you want of the colors 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.390
 you want I wanted to put these because 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.600
 they are like more vibrant colors and they are 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.150
 much more beautiful spheres and care 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.850
 You will fill in the name and if you want 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.000
 you can put on top the leader glitter 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.950
 a glaze with glitters I do not know there 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.440
 many options of the I put these 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.610
 stars and the top coat so that it lasts 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.620
 more and ready 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.220
 All komen are super easy to them 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.620
 liked most it is maybe easterly 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.210
 better not maybe they liked it better 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.640
 little piece of snow that is a bit on the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.250
 medium forum looks at the best this is 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.650
