on top and on this side a glass block

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.130 
on top and on this side a glass block
then<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.890> place<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.780> snow

then we want to go one up place one snow

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.439 
then we want to go one up place one snow
and<00:00:58.670> three<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.850> glass<00:01:00.120> blocks<00:01:00.449> around<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
and three more glass blocks around it

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
and three more glass blocks around it
then<00:01:03.449> underneath<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.949> glass<00:01:05.309> block<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
then underneath this glass block and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
then underneath this glass block and
this<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> place<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> fence<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
this one want to place a fence and a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.179 
this one want to place a fence and a
fence<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.970> between<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:12.570> next<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
fence in between then next we want to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.350 
fence in between then next we want to
place<00:01:14.670> our<00:01:15.090> chest<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
place our chest right here and then the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
place our chest right here and then the
six<00:01:18.689> hopper<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.979> facing<00:01:20.850> into<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
six hopper like this one facing into the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.679 
six hopper like this one facing into the
chest<00:01:22.610> one<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.140> or<00:01:25.140> two<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.210> then<00:01:27.210> open

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
chest one like this or two and then open

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.679 
chest one like this or two and then open
this<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.200> wrong<00:01:28.820> other<00:01:29.820> ones<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this one is wrong other ones like this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
this one is wrong other ones like this
so<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.470> three<00:01:31.979> hopper<00:01:32.220> lines<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:32.909> face

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so we have three hopper lines which face

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.080 
so we have three hopper lines which face
into<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.930> chest<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.159> suck<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
into the chest so we can suck up the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.319 
into the chest so we can suck up the
snow<00:01:36.479> fast<00:01:36.869> enough<00:01:37.520> then<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.150> front

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
snow fast enough then go to the front

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.710 
snow fast enough then go to the front
and<00:01:39.570> place<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.920> hopper<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.939> card<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> rail

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and place one hopper my card on the rail

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.950 
and place one hopper my card on the rail
you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.860> place<00:01:44.369> more<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.090> mine<00:01:45.240> cards<00:01:45.600> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you can place more up on mine cards so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.609 
you can place more up on mine cards so
it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.680> faster<00:01:47.189> move<00:01:48.090> pointing<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's a bit faster move pointing on the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.120 
it's a bit faster move pointing on the
side<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.220> rail<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:52.560> most<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
side of the rail but in most of the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
side of the rail but in most of the
times<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.640> hopper<00:01:54.000> my<00:01:54.210> card<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:54.810> enough

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
times one hopper my card will be enough

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.490 
times one hopper my card will be enough
and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.750> top<00:01:57.930> place<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and then just go to the top place the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.789 
and then just go to the top place the
second<00:01:58.860> snow<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.310> pumpkin<00:02:00.320> then<00:02:01.320> remove

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
second snow and the pumpkin then remove

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.109 
second snow and the pumpkin then remove
the<00:02:02.040> rail<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:04.009> push<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.310> mine<00:02:05.520> cart<00:02:05.670> over<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the rail and push the mine cart over to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.280 
the rail and push the mine cart over to
the<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.479> edge

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the other edge

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.609 
the other edge
and<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.860> farm<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.430> ready<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:10.410> hope

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
and the farm is ready for use so I hope

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.580
