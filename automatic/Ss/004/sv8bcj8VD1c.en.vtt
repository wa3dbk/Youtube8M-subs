you could say that all man you know
Montana<00:03:02.769> had<00:03:03.310> rice<00:03:03.670> he<00:03:04.120> had<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:05.140> know<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
Montana had rice he had you know a

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.640 
Montana had rice he had you know a
better<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:06.670> better<00:03:07.000> offensive<00:03:07.780> scheme<00:03:08.230> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
better a better offensive scheme and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.089 
better a better offensive scheme and
that's<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.280> arm<00:03:10.620> if<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.829> want<00:03:12.010> to

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
that's this and this arm if you want to

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.580 
that's this and this arm if you want to
use<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.849> say<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.299> I<00:03:13.480> think<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.349> Brady

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
use that and say that I think that Brady

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.069 
use that and say that I think that Brady
is<00:03:14.769> probably<00:03:15.069> even<00:03:15.220> better<00:03:15.359> at<00:03:16.359> this<00:03:16.629> point<00:03:16.959> I

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
is probably even better at this point I

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.899 
is probably even better at this point I
mean<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.620> know<00:03:17.739> there<00:03:18.129> was<00:03:18.220> at<00:03:18.370> one<00:03:18.400> season

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that he had randy moss oh we all know

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.619 
that he had randy moss oh we all know
what<00:03:20.799> kind<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.430> player<00:03:21.609> Randy<00:03:21.970> Moss<00:03:22.150> was<00:03:22.359> doing

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
what kind of player Randy Moss was doing

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.559 
what kind of player Randy Moss was doing
that<00:03:22.780> record-breaking<00:03:23.709> NFL<00:03:24.670> tying<00:03:24.940> season

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
that record-breaking NFL tying season

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.089 
that record-breaking NFL tying season
but<00:03:26.489> for<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.549> most<00:03:27.730> part<00:03:27.849> man<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.569> mean<00:03:29.260> Tom

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
but for the most part man I mean Tom

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.339 
but for the most part man I mean Tom
Brady<00:03:30.370> just<00:03:30.670> finds<00:03:31.030> ways<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.450> win<00:03:31.900> he<00:03:32.109> makes

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
Brady just finds ways to win he makes

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.589

his<00:03:32.530> team<00:03:32.769> better<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:34.060> think<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.450> it's

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
his team better and I think that it's

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.379 
his team better and I think that it's
safe<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.989> say<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.889> we<00:03:36.010> have<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.489> put<00:03:36.730> Tom<00:03:37.030> Brady

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
safe to say and we have to put Tom Brady

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.849 
safe to say and we have to put Tom Brady
in<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:38.260> same<00:03:38.620> conversation<00:03:38.980> as<00:03:40.319> Joe<00:03:41.319> Montana
