 14 times in total played per unit 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.960
 both the first and a good start you can 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 saying yes we ca n't start 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.610

 button so beautiful 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.070
 but so competition that he fights for 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.220
 the right back position with the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.440
 colombian santiago arias 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.920
 there is nice and healthy it also needs photo 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.950
 with football well and that makes you too 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.690
 get more motivation and yes you do 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.500
 yourself be better to be better than you 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.400
 However, they are already becoming competitors 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.240
 behind from the moment that pps 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 party come before that was this 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.070
 attacking each other played see 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.960
 back in them game but from that moment 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.490
 He actually a PC commission year 15 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.620
 at that position 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.470
 He started to play 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.510
 until a laid out your stuff in it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 first team scored so far 3 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.910
 times the question is which is the nicest 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.600
 yes this in no but of course but then 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.130
 now so be a nice idea what i am 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 made room in the cup 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.940
 because yes of course in the first is that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.330
 is what counts 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.980
 yes of course yes jan to a huge hard 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.800
 but there was something 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.980
 importantly oh do you have a deadline 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.270
 planning for you when say fixed 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.610

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.420
 enter competition 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.800
 age is then the rule of age 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.630
 definitely plays a role when you come to us 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.910
 team viewers are a young team 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.450
 So yes ar lift it but no matter how 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.660
 old you are 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.230
 how it works and composition tries the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.820
 parties team such as 19-year-old Joshua 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.320

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.370

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.230
