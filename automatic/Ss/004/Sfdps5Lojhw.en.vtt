00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
identical to the standard wired go but

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.259 
identical to the standard wired go but
it's<00:00:12.740> got<00:00:12.889> a<00:00:12.919> great<00:00:13.190> new<00:00:13.370> feature<00:00:13.610> which<00:00:14.059> is

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
it's got a great new feature which is

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.330 
it's got a great new feature which is
the<00:00:14.389> Bluetooth<00:00:14.599> capability<00:00:15.469> so<00:00:16.190> they're

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
the Bluetooth capability so they're

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.920 
the Bluetooth capability so they're
really<00:00:16.460> cutting<00:00:16.820> the<00:00:16.910> cord<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.480> allows<00:00:17.720> the

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
really cutting the cord and allows the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.660 
really cutting the cord and allows the
user<00:00:18.140> a<00:00:18.289> lot<00:00:18.470> more<00:00:18.710> freedom<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:19.250> movement

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
user a lot more freedom and movement

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.509 
user a lot more freedom and movement
while<00:00:20.269> working<00:00:20.980> now<00:00:21.980> as<00:00:22.130> I<00:00:22.220> said<00:00:22.279> it's

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
while working now as I said it's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.279 
while working now as I said it's
identical<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.269> standard<00:00:23.330> go<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.230> you

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
identical to the standard go so you

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.810 
identical to the standard go so you
still<00:00:24.500> get<00:00:24.619> all<00:00:24.679> those<00:00:24.859> great<00:00:25.160> ergonomic

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820
