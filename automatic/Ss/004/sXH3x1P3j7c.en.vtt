00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 claudio borhi just communicated by 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.059
 internal with us and said the following 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.550
 I want through you to say more 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.799
 it's late many greetings send 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.070
 many to one of my great idols 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.060
 musicals 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.060
 I 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.039
 a very big thanks because I 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.519
 I had when claudio 6 look with the 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.519
 selection 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.730
 I went to talk with Claudio to paint 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.810
 and he had as a person a concern 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 very big in paint always 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.450
 or stories of very great players 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.030
 there were pictures of great players 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.040
 and I was very worried because those 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.190
 photos were in a house in painting 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 abandoned lying in a corner and he 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.980
 It bothered much to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.040
 the story is not respected 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.020
 I tell you no no to me the story with 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.390
 another type of players that gave a lot 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.390
 more within the selection and that was 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:13.020
 in that photo and all bullshit 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 and the comfortable a lot is and Mr. I much 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 with that said roberto better I do not fit in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.970
 the head that is done with those who 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 with the history of sport you do not deserve 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.360
 and he sent some paint works to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.070
 bring what not 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.450
 you know inside painting 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.960
 he had not been talking after his 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 departure of the selection and he 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.990
 we underline the fact that you have 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.650
 called to tell you to achieve the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.650
 program that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.829
 is a guy if one has difficulties with 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:55.060
 as technicians like any technician 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.679
 but it continues to make great people are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.210
 two different things the person does not 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.149
 change for being a good omar technician 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.369
 technician and l a very good person 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.710
 Roberto at some minute purpose 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.410
 these photos that are shot in a minute 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.610
 and not only in sports history 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.519
 we have history in the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.580
 literature in history in the middle 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:19.400
 artistic in commentator journalism 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.530
 you see the present you are also not 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.980
 a country to live only as a museum 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.599
 it is clear but 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.060
 the boys who are today in 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.849
 different professions have to 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.650

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.489
 day they are going to be part history and I 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.489
