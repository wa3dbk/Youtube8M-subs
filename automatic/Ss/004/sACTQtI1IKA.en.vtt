going to control the rear windows all

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
going to control the rear windows all
the<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> back<00:00:58.620> those<00:00:59.160> are<00:00:59.190> actually

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the way in the back those are actually

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
the way in the back those are actually
going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> fan<00:01:00.149> out<00:01:00.359> both<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.960> are

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
going to fan out both of them are

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
going to fan out both of them are
controlled<00:01:01.350> by<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> switch<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.640> can

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
controlled by one switch so you can

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
controlled by one switch so you can
either<00:01:02.940> close<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.750> open<00:01:04.110> them

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
either close them or you can open them

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.690 
either close them or you can open them
and<00:01:04.530> they're<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.100> both<00:01:05.220> gonna<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.549> together

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and they're gonna both gonna go together

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940 
and they're gonna both gonna go together
so<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.600> switch<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.560> simple

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
so it's just one switch really simple

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560 
so it's just one switch really simple
now<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.610> how<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> ventilation

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
now that's how you get the ventilation

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
now that's how you get the ventilation
going<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:10.979> enough

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
going through what if that's not enough

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
going through what if that's not enough
come<00:01:12.000> hop<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.750> let's<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.049> what

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
come hop in the back here let's see what

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
come hop in the back here let's see what
else<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.439> do<00:01:13.850> like<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> we're<00:01:15.360> in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
else we can do like now that we're in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
else we can do like now that we're in
the<00:01:15.509> back<00:01:15.689> there<00:01:15.930> you're<00:01:16.080> gonna<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.500> how<00:01:16.619> big

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the back there you're gonna see how big

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.499 
the back there you're gonna see how big
these<00:01:16.950> nice<00:01:17.189> windows<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.150> said<00:01:18.360> that
