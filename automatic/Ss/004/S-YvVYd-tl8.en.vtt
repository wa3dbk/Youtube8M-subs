and<00:00:08.820> now<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.719> need<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.460> do<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> bunch<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.969> stuff

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and now we need to do a bunch of stuff

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.660 
and now we need to do a bunch of stuff
for<00:00:12.389> these<00:00:12.540> gems<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.830> let's<00:00:13.980> drag<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.309> prefab

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
for these gems so let's drag this prefab

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.510 
for these gems so let's drag this prefab
back<00:00:14.880> in<00:00:15.320> create<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> knife<00:00:16.500> script<00:00:16.890> call<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
back in create a knife script call it

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.929 
back in create a knife script call it
gem<00:00:19.910> attach<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:21.330> gem<00:00:21.949> and<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.699> our

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
gem attach it to our gem and our our

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.470 
gem attach it to our gem and our our
game<00:00:24.570> object<00:00:24.720> called<00:00:25.350> gem<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.460> then<00:00:27.060> we're

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
game object called gem and then we're

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.669 
game object called gem and then we're
going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.630> reproof<00:00:28.080> add<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:29.960> all<00:00:30.960> right<00:00:31.140> let

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
going to reproof add this all right let

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.389 
going to reproof add this all right let
me<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:31.890> delete<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:32.940> gem<00:00:34.070> has<00:00:35.070> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
me can delete it so now our gem has that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.799 
me can delete it so now our gem has that
double<00:00:35.640> click<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> script<00:00:36.300> open<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.690> up

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
double click on the script open it up

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.639 
double click on the script open it up
and<00:00:38.750> hear<00:00:40.700> what<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:41.730> gem<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and hear what our gem is going to do is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100 
and hear what our gem is going to do is
it's<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.430> respond<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> click<00:00:45.300> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's going to respond to a click it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's going to respond to a click it's
going<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:48.320> point<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.469> Mouse<00:00:50.129> down<00:00:51.620> this<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
going to a point on Mouse down this is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
going to a point on Mouse down this is
the<00:00:52.920> unity<00:00:53.250> command<00:00:53.610> -<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.199> acknowledge

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the unity command - just to acknowledge

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.880 
the unity command - just to acknowledge
that<00:00:55.920> something's<00:00:56.219> clicking<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that something's clicking it so you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.960 
that something's clicking it so you
can't<00:01:00.230> clicked<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.700> as<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.880> see

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
can't clicked and as you can see

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.859 
can't clicked and as you can see
equipped<00:01:09.360> pops<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
equipped pops up so now you can

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.020 
equipped pops up so now you can
determine<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.409> jam<00:01:13.650> you're<00:01:13.830> clicking<00:01:14.010> on

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.590 

what<00:01:18.030> else<00:01:18.180> we're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:21.570> needs

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
what else we're going to do is it needs

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.179 
what else we're going to do is it needs
to<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.220> its<00:01:23.220> neighbors<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to know its neighbors so we're going to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.899 
to know its neighbors so we're going to
do<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.780> trick<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.460> would<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.579> seem<00:01:29.790> out

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
do a little trick to would you seem out

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
do a little trick to would you seem out
of<00:01:29.970> effort<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> with

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
of effort we actually have to do with

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
of effort we actually have to do with
this<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.560> figure<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.860> its<00:01:32.009> neighbors<00:01:35.630> game

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this to figure out its neighbors game

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.609 
this to figure out its neighbors game
object<00:01:40.250> her<00:01:41.840> actually<00:01:42.840> gonna<00:01:42.930> call<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.320> gem

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
object her actually gonna call these gem

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
object her actually gonna call these gem
I<00:01:44.299> want<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> list<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.659> gem<00:01:45.869> neighbors<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> we'll

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
I want a list of gem neighbors and we'll

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
I want a list of gem neighbors and we'll
actually<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> same<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.009> back

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
actually when we do the same thing back

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
actually when we do the same thing back
up<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> list<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
up here this is going to be a list of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
up here this is going to be a list of
gems<00:01:55.009> or<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.490> list<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.939> gem<00:01:57.180> gems<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
gems or a list of gem gems and then to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.450 
gems or a list of gem gems and then to
add<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.670> we<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> component<00:02:01.619> gem

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
add it we need to get the component gem

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.399 
add it we need to get the component gem
it<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.640> makes<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.909> easier<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.509> access<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
it just makes it easier to access the

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.959 
it just makes it easier to access the
individual<00:02:06.950> fields<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.700> we're<00:02:07.820> going<00:02:07.909> to

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
individual fields that we're going to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:20.110 
individual fields that we're going to
have<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.239> here<00:02:08.360> later<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:14.080> gem<00:02:15.940> okay<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
have in here later on gem okay so in

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600 
have in here later on gem okay so in
order<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.569> find<00:02:20.989> our<00:02:21.200> neighbors<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:22.580> can

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
order to find our neighbors you can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.970 
order to find our neighbors you can
either<00:02:22.910> do<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> lot<00:02:23.299> of<00:02:23.330> list<00:02:24.080> manipulation<00:02:24.739> or

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
either do a lot of list manipulation or

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.400 
either do a lot of list manipulation or
you<00:02:25.879> can<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.180> something<00:02:26.780> slightly<00:02:27.709> clever<00:02:29.410> so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
you can do something slightly clever so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.960 
you can do something slightly clever so
what<00:02:30.530> we're<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> do<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.670> one<00:02:31.790> that's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
what we're going to do is the one that's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.420 
what we're going to do is the one that's
a<00:02:32.120> lot<00:02:32.450> less<00:02:32.599> work<00:02:32.810> I'm<00:02:33.799> going<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.160> create<00:02:34.340> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
a lot less work I'm going to create a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.949 
a lot less work I'm going to create a
cube<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.000> we're<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.329> drag<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.569> into

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
cube and we're going to drag that into

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:45.479 
cube and we're going to drag that into
our<00:02:36.170> gem<00:02:38.829> I'm<00:02:39.829> going<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> call<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:41.980> feeler

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.130 

we're<00:02:46.489> going<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.670> say<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.090> point<00:02:47.299> five

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
we're going to say this is point five

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.449 
we're going to say this is point five
five<00:02:48.799> point<00:02:49.099> five<00:02:49.340> five<00:02:49.790> point<00:02:50.060> five<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:54.459> try

what this is going to do is it's going

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.559 
what this is going to do is it's going
to<00:03:08.389> poke<00:03:08.660> into<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.260> cube<00:03:09.500> next<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.450> this

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
to poke into the cube next to it so this

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.069 
to poke into the cube next to it so this
is<00:03:11.750> point<00:03:12.049> six<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:14.660> going<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:14.959> one

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
is point six and it's going to have one

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.559 
is point six and it's going to have one
on<00:03:15.170> each<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.530> its<00:03:15.590> axis<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:17.150> top<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:17.569 
on each of its axis is the top and the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.530 
on each of its axis is the top and the
bottom<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.340> left<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.549> right<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:20.180> it's

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
bottom and the left and right and it's

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.090 
bottom and the left and right and it's
going<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.720> point<00:03:20.959> into<00:03:21.139> each<00:03:21.319> cube<00:03:21.620> next<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:21.980> it

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
going to point into each cube next to it

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.069 
going to point into each cube next to it
to<00:03:22.340> determine<00:03:22.609> if<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> cube<00:03:23.450> is<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.870> fact

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
to determine if that cube is in fact

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.809 
to determine if that cube is in fact
next<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.440> it<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.430> we're<00:03:25.519> going<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.670> use

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
next to it and so we're going to use

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.190 
next to it and so we're going to use
this<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.120> determine<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:26.630> of<00:03:26.720> our<00:03:26.840> neighbors

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
this to determine all of our neighbors

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:43.870 
this to determine all of our neighbors
and<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:37.220> let's<00:03:37.430> make<00:03:37.670> four<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.120> them<00:03:42.880> zero

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
and so let's make four of them zero

00:03:43.880 --> 00:04:00.410 
and so let's make four of them zero
point<00:03:44.660> five<00:03:51.819> six

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:19.680 

then<00:04:09.270> one<00:04:10.270> more<00:04:10.630> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.990> bottom<00:04:17.730> alright<00:04:18.730> so

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
then one more on the bottom alright so

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.190 
then one more on the bottom alright so
now<00:04:19.840> we<00:04:19.900> have<00:04:20.230> this<00:04:20.470> weird-looking<00:04:21.370> gem<00:04:22.200> that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
now we have this weird-looking gem that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.230 
now we have this weird-looking gem that
has<00:04:23.260> these<00:04:23.620> four<00:04:23.860> prongs<00:04:24.190> sticking<00:04:24.850> out<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.090> it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
has these four prongs sticking out of it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.910 
has these four prongs sticking out of it
and<00:04:25.720> these<00:04:25.930> problems<00:04:26.230> will<00:04:26.470> push<00:04:26.620> into<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
and these problems will push into the

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.890 
and these problems will push into the
cubes<00:04:27.520> next<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> them<00:04:27.940> and<00:04:28.180> when<00:04:28.750> they<00:04:28.840> do

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
cubes next to them and when they do

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.860 
cubes next to them and when they do
they'll<00:04:29.230> also<00:04:29.670> send<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.730> message<00:04:30.760> from<00:04:31.660> there

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
they'll also send a message from there

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.800 
they'll also send a message from there
on<00:04:32.020> trigger<00:04:32.650> event<00:04:33.450> we're<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.630> go<00:04:34.720> ahead

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
on trigger event we're going to go ahead

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.930 
on trigger event we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:35.050> remove<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.710> mesh<00:04:35.980> filter<00:04:36.400> because<00:04:36.790> we

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
and remove the mesh filter because we

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.080 
and remove the mesh filter because we
don't<00:04:37.120> want<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.420> and<00:04:38.580> I'm<00:04:39.580> going<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.790> remove

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
don't want that and I'm going to remove

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.870 
don't want that and I'm going to remove
this<00:04:40.810> as<00:04:41.080> well<00:04:41.290> so<00:04:41.530> it's<00:04:41.860> just<00:04:41.950> a<00:04:42.310> box<00:04:42.520> glider

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
this as well so it's just a box glider

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.500 
this as well so it's just a box glider
on<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.790> then<00:04:45.910> we're<00:04:46.120> going<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.300> go<00:04:46.390> ahead

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
on it and then we're going to go ahead

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.850 
on it and then we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:46.720> save<00:04:46.900> this<00:04:49.800> hmm<00:04:51.810> okay<00:04:52.810> we<00:04:53.290> also<00:04:53.470> need<00:04:53.740> to

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
and save this hmm okay we also need to

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.500 
and save this hmm okay we also need to
make<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.040> new<00:04:54.220> script<00:04:54.490> we're<00:04:55.150> going<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.360> call

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
make a new script we're going to call

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.220 
make a new script we're going to call
this<00:04:55.660> a<00:04:55.720> healer<00:04:56.230> script

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.290
