00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 well here we are on the second date 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.010
 with the faq video about my book 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.780
 I answer the questions you have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.969
 left under the first video that if not 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 you have seen, however, found rainbow one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 smile asks me mainly who he is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 turned the novel are guys also a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 more mature public 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.100
 let's say that for both of you peace why 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
 however, there are also a lot of things 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.410
 crude and violent because I am a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 lover of slower but bloody things 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 only the books of reality films 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 no, that is, sir, in reality I see one who 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 bleeding around the other I say that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 sucks I feel like throwing up but in books 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.480
 I think that in any case the real one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 human reality must also be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.160
 always manifested well so it is a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 book however very mature under certain 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 aspects with the empire 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 become more complicated to write 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 central beginning or end I must say that with 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 I have never had any problems with this book 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.649
 writing I got stuck between 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 quotation marks only after the first 50 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.300
 pages is because I wrote 50 pages 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 I have been stopped for a few months and then I have 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.470
 continued but otherwise it always is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.810
 quiet smooth yarn so maybe 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 we can say slightly beginning after the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.960
 fifty pages but simply too 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.790
 because I was n't too messed up 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.650
 why don't we read a little something 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.409
 a preview of the first chapter 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 I would like to do it but I can not but I can 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.150
 I prefer not at the moment when 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 when I know the book will be 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.680
 published I will do so willingly but first 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.980
 I would like to be sure of being 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.450
 we say protected here even if in any case 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.560
 we have indeed understood recently but the 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.970
 fact that of the first chapter indeed 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 understands nothing however could also 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.600
 be counterproductive first chapter 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 maybe it can be read for others can 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 be intense for others not then 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.420
 could be counterproductive for 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 some things practically a book with the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.650
 future dystopian plot as a hunger 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.930
 green games wind half runner in a 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.120
 sense so yes this future 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.950
 dystopian say yes even if 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.780
 however with these three stories it is not there 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.550
 among a kite he will publish it this year 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.280
 also only in ebook format or 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.600
 awaits the response of the publishers 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.430
 this year also in ebook format at least 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.780
 that my publisher tells me 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.790
 look for this had we are full 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.830
 that we have it published in 2006 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.660
 how many he collected before starting 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.060
 to write the book before I wrote one 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.920
 plot as you normally do I did 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.350
 a schemino with all the plot all 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.570
 all plots all the characters all 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.880
 things of that of milk that ballack e 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.920
 so first stubborn plot from the beginning 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.110
 at the end then start central part 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.570
 end then while I was writing I came 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.280
 other regions is net this time I put it 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.830
 also updated the file with the story 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120
 so it was a continuous no answer 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.860
 general to all those who have me 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.900
 asked instead concerns the publication 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.330
 how far we are sending new emails 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.700
 to other publishers that we hope started 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 fly a little lower before spa 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.890
 appointed Mondadori would separate if 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.230
 they are slamming it highly and feeling it 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.220
 has never published and problem which 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.680
 guys I'm very very pissed and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.090
 also a bit pessimistic for one thing 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.320
 practically after I had done the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.330
 first video in which he announced he had 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.640
 written a book I was contacted 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.380
 from a lot of people he asked me if 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.730
 they could cover me if they could 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.590
 correct my drafts and center everything 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.560
 very nice he also contacted me 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.020
 girl according to what she said 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.819
 precisely to collaborate on a well-known home 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.560
 editor we never kept in touch 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.569
 searched in the underline this thing has me 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.790
 having ascertained, we hear each other very much 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.680
 often a question from me but did not follow 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.470
 his reply always times in the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.209
 pause I send you the book a certain point 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.430
 does his collaboration consisted of 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.470
 read unpublished texts proposes from the house 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.670
 publisher if they were good so for me 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.069
 it was a great opportunity 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.140
 but still a little bit I was scared 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.180
 honestly because I wanted to send her alone 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.310
 50 pages talking to a friend of mine who 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.630
 helped me correct the book 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.670
 we came to the conclusion that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.600
 perhaps it was better to send the han and 140 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.549
 because 140 pages contain very many 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.440
 Twists so many beautiful things that 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.940
 they would have inspired her anyway 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.220
 certainly to go on and then to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.700
 recommend polipo le send these 140 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.980
 pages 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.870
 she tells me I read it over the weekend 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.060
 before I can't go well enough with i 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.190
 weekend and I write has elected and I have not 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.780
 bed I will do it this other weekend rio 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.730
 that no problems pass 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.130
 weeks I don't insist because I 'm not 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.890
 a person who is scassaminchia boys 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.530
 does not answer me from February 12th is 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.260
 totally gone so I'm a bit 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.669
 scared as well as 240 pages it were 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.370
 strange abroad flying the whole plot 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.860
 because then not for modest he really loves 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.229
 is a book that has many hits of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.270
 scene that really change every page 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.950
 there is something new and that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.110
 consequently it cannot be 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.450
 extrapolated the ending from the first 140 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.330
 pages because almost 500 so 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.100
 but guys if I'm 240 pages this 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.990
 disappears I give calculations a moment hands 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.539
 face and the thing that worries me most is 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.590
 which however she has many friends among 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.180
 other youtube hermitages of mine 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.539
 concern could be that 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.760
 maybe ok they do n't throw me the whole book 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.169
 and local publishes your name or name 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.510
 of a dress for but you could take 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.789
 the cue from the first 140 pages to do 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.530
 post something or your own to the name of 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.510
 these youtuber happen very often that 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.490
 that are published in the books to names of 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.289
 certain authors may actually behind there is a 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.450
 another author who wrote everything yes 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.110
 called ghostwriting I'm telling myself 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.000
 a political complaint will be issued and it is 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.150
 flash the amp I find one of these 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.440
 youtuber that his friend and public 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.240
 something like that 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.909
 the complaint was as large as one 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.919
 home and I hope this girl 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.080
 now he is seeing it built and yes 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.150

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.130
 his life thinking also to look at this 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.659
 asshole being making movies in 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.460
 actually his book made me shit 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.860
 or actually just the brolo 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.659
 fully calculated and I took 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.460
 lamette around that you took me in 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.960
