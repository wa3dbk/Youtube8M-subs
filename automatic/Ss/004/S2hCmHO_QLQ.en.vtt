 in the end 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.270
 why 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.890

 all the energy you have to eat 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.959

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.030

 more in your body in your face are you 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 trying to make your body move and 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.669
 move is moving but your face is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.930
 like half asleep and if this is what 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.430
 He also added that you have had problems 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.799
 of air you had to stop saying 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 some syllables to achieve let's say 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.390
 spin the prayers that came if I want 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.190

 allows an incredible voice no no we're going to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 put in there I'll talk about the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.290
 movement I feel that today unlike 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.720
 of your other presentations has been a 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.500
 movement with less self-identity 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.390
 two months has been a lot of not for the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.120
 tired I imagine not but do not lose 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
 that in these cases stay put because 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.940
 has this stage presence that 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.530
 enough 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.530

 cool to have someone the ability 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.760
 to entertain besides singing and singing 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.190
 nice to entertain you not to try 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.170
 with your scenic domain if it was better or 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.270
 worse than other times it is also 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.760
 complicated to make hits hits hits hits in 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.560

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.020
