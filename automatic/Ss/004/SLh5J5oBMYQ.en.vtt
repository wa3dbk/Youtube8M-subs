into<00:04:22.789> one<00:04:22.940> model<00:04:23.330> we're<00:04:23.780> using<00:04:23.990> elements<00:04:24.590> here

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
into one model we're using elements here

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.529 
into one model we're using elements here
in<00:04:24.830> kind<00:04:25.280> of<00:04:25.310> different<00:04:25.669> ways<00:04:25.850> than<00:04:26.120> what<00:04:26.419> you

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
in kind of different ways than what you

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.930 
in kind of different ways than what you
might<00:04:26.690> expect<00:04:27.370> when<00:04:28.370> you<00:04:28.460> work<00:04:28.610> in<00:04:28.789> different

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
might expect when you work in different

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.300 
might expect when you work in different
sizes<00:04:29.300> you're<00:04:29.750> using<00:04:30.110> Lego<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.770> different

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
sizes you're using Lego in different

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.550 
sizes you're using Lego in different
ways<00:04:31.490> for<00:04:31.850> example<00:04:31.880> this<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> minifigure

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
ways for example this is a minifigure

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.279 
ways for example this is a minifigure
head<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.460> isn't<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.820> green<00:04:35.060> color<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:36.110> when

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
head and it isn't a green color so when

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.159 
head and it isn't a green color so when
we<00:04:36.440> use<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.620> on<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:36.889> brown<00:04:37.220> cylinder<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.750> becomes

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
we use it on a brown cylinder it becomes

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.529 
we use it on a brown cylinder it becomes
a<00:04:39.289> lego<00:04:39.470> tree<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.400> grill<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.180> you

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
a lego tree this is a grill and you

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.930 
a lego tree this is a grill and you
might<00:04:41.720> use<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.260> on<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.590> spaceship<00:04:43.280> for<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.580> vent

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
might use this on a spaceship for a vent

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.350 
might use this on a spaceship for a vent
or<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.780> car<00:04:45.380> for<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:45.740> bumper<00:04:46.160> but<00:04:46.760> were<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.090> when

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
or a car for a bumper but were you when

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.390 
or a car for a bumper but were you when
you're<00:04:47.510> using<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.930> in<00:04:48.080> microscale<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:49.039> becomes

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
you're using it in microscale it becomes

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.100 
you're using it in microscale it becomes
the<00:04:49.639> roof<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.210> building<00:04:50.389> give<00:04:50.780> us<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:50.930> really

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the roof of a building give us a really

that's<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.160> great<00:05:49.400> question<00:05:49.670> honest<00:05:50.240> god<00:05:50.420> I

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
that's a great question honest god I

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.860 
that's a great question honest god I
would<00:05:50.720> love<00:05:50.960> to<00:05:51.080> build<00:05:51.230> a<00:05:51.530> 15<00:05:52.310> foot<00:05:52.580> diameter

desktop<00:05:53.870> I<00:05:54.140> think<00:05:54.740> that<00:05:54.920> would<00:05:55.070> be<00:05:55.100> really

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
desktop I think that would be really

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.610 
desktop I think that would be really
cool<00:05:55.730> but<00:05:56.480> better<00:05:56.720> than<00:05:56.900> that<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.290> would<00:05:57.470> like

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
cool but better than that I would like

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.380 
cool but better than that I would like
to<00:05:57.740> make<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.070> group<00:05:58.250> project<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:59.000> I'd<00:05:59.270> like

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
to make it a group project and I'd like

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.910 
to make it a group project and I'd like
to<00:05:59.570> make<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.900> where<00:06:00.080> we<00:06:00.200> can<00:06:00.380> include<00:06:00.590> kids

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:00.920
