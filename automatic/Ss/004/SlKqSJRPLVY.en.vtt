the<00:02:05.659> pond

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.520 

hard<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.170> see<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.530> today<00:02:11.740> with<00:02:12.250> all<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.420> snow

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.250 

looks<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.770> they<00:02:17.950> plowed<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> little<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:19.260> well

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.230 
looks like they plowed a little bit well
this<00:02:20.410> doesn't<00:02:20.650> look<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.890> plow<00:02:21.280> desert<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.970> I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
this doesn't look that plow desert it I

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.080 
this doesn't look that plow desert it I
think<00:02:23.170> it's<00:02:23.320> mostly<00:02:23.650> cars<00:02:23.980> driving<00:02:24.580> over<00:02:24.970> it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.530 
think it's mostly cars driving over it
just<00:02:25.440> make<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.470> kind<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.950> chopped<00:02:27.250> up<00:02:27.540> there

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
just make it kind of chopped up there
