00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.190
 hello youtube friends talk to them there are 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:13.559
 flavor and with a second tutorial of what 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 what is android good today I'm going to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.289
 teach an ideal that we have lost a lot 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 By facebook 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.039
 some companies the friends others 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.400
 known 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.500
 that they do not want to pass applications to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.850
 the sd but those application are not 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 allowed such as whatsapp 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.560
 Well I have investigated what he does and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.470
 if there are forms but they have to be 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.530
 root user but some in the drivers 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.480
 we are going to see them install them good today 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.230
 I'm going to show you how to move on 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 applications not allowed to the sd 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 without being root 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.400
 then if you are the champion my phone 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 I was rooted right now the sentence because 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.890
 that brightness but well I'm no longer root and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 now I want to go back past apps 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.899
 I'm going to teach you today how 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.549
 The first thing to do is go to the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.549
 link that I left in the description 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.649
 we will get and a page will appear 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.719
 how is discovering android is not my 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.110
 blog is the blog of some other people 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:27.690
 I found but good 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 good if you want to read that you can read it 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.300
 but well here we will see what it says 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.330
 programs like app 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.970
 a pepe 2 s dec to pass the programs 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.440
 installed the phone to the sd memory 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 the problem is that not much of the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.100
 programs that are installed in this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.260
 memory like facebook or whatsapp not 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.720
 can be passed unless you have 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.680
 certain permissions root parameters 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.110
 currently if we open the program without 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 have these same permissions we will appear 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.430
 the screen as shown to 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.430
 continuation 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.259
 okay 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.240
 good as it is necessary to do that we unload 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.360
 the program to be able to pass the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.849
 phone programs to 32 good have 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 what to see is look here says 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.080
 we unload 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.530
 the program to be able to pass the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.120
 phone programs to the card 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.170
 download the program 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.049
 pepe 2 sd as per the steps we 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.850
 we direct to applications and settings 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.900
 USB debugging 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 as shown here 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.390
 ok as a third step is that we do 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 next program 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 next program you have to click here 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.050
 and it will download automatically 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.050
 I do not wait for it because I have it 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.800
 but once downloaded we go to 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
