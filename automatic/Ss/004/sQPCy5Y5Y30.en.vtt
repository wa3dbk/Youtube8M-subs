of<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:42.970> things<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:44.590> does<00:02:44.980> need<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.310> be

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
of these things it does need to be

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.180 
of these things it does need to be
enabled<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.299> run<00:02:46.600> otherwise<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:48.010> you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
enabled to run otherwise it if you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.910 
enabled to run otherwise it if you
uncheck<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.640> that's<00:02:49.090> not<00:02:49.420> going<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.690> work

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
uncheck that that's not going to work

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.789 
uncheck that that's not going to work
now<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:50.980> want<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.489> go<00:02:51.579> into<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.910> schedule<00:02:52.239> and

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
now we want to go into the schedule and

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.520 
now we want to go into the schedule and
you<00:02:53.799> can<00:02:54.010> choose<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:55.030> run<00:02:55.570> daily<00:02:55.900> weekly

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
you can choose to run daily weekly

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.080 
you can choose to run daily weekly
monthly<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.060> something<00:02:58.560> daily<00:02:59.560> is

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
monthly this is something daily is

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.960 
monthly this is something daily is
probably<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.269> best<00:03:01.890> weekly<00:03:02.890> can<00:03:03.549> be<00:03:03.700> fine

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
probably the best weekly can be fine

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
probably the best weekly can be fine
monthly<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:05.799> got<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.370> be<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.519> minimum<00:03:06.880> now<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
monthly is got to be a minimum now you

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.710 
monthly is got to be a minimum now you
could<00:03:09.280> have<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.730> runs<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.060> start<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.510> or

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
could have it so it runs it start up or

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.569 
could have it so it runs it start up or
at<00:03:10.810> log<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.320> every<00:03:11.470> time<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.250> turn<00:03:12.400> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
at log in every time you turn the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.979 
at log in every time you turn the
computer<00:03:12.850> on<00:03:13.000> its<00:03:13.329> going<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.540> start<00:03:13.690> running

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
computer on its going to start running

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.470 
computer on its going to start running
but<00:03:14.890> that's<00:03:15.220> probably<00:03:15.790> not<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.060> best<00:03:16.180> thing

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
but that's probably not the best thing

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.930 
but that's probably not the best thing
since<00:03:16.959> when<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> turn<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.220> computer<00:03:18.579> on<00:03:18.730> you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
since when you turn the computer on you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.449 
since when you turn the computer on you
want<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> start<00:03:19.359> using<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.650> wouldn't

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
want to start using it so I wouldn't

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.590 
want to start using it so I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:21.790> that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
recommend that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.690 
recommend that
you're<00:03:23.440> turning<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.860> computer<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.460> start

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
you're turning to computer on to start

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.460 
you're turning to computer on to start
working<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.750> last<00:03:25.930> thing<00:03:26.080> you<00:03:26.260> need<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
working so the last thing you need is

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.280 
working so the last thing you need is
something<00:03:26.800> else<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.220> slow<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:27.520> down<00:03:28.290> best

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
something else to slow you down best

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.010 
something else to slow you down best
thing<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.650> find<00:03:29.970> personally<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.750> choose

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
thing I find personally is to choose

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.290 
thing I find personally is to choose
when<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.410> idle<00:03:32.830> so<00:03:33.520> you<00:03:33.610> can<00:03:33.820> choose<00:03:34.090> that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
when it's idle so you can choose that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.680 
when it's idle so you can choose that
option<00:03:35.520> this<00:03:36.520> way<00:03:36.790> it's<00:03:36.940> only<00:03:37.300> going<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.480> run

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
option this way it's only going to run

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.500 
option this way it's only going to run
when<00:03:37.900> you're<00:03:38.020> not<00:03:38.170> using<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.680> compare<00:03:39.070> and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
when you're not using the compare and

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.480 
when you're not using the compare and
you<00:03:40.510> can<00:03:40.660> set<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:41.110> what<00:03:41.260> amount<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.620> time<00:03:41.860> you

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
you can set for what amount of time you

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.130 
you can set for what amount of time you
want<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.820> computer<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.240> be<00:03:43.450> idled<00:03:43.780> before

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
want the computer to be idled before

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.090 
want the computer to be idled before
before<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.830> starts<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.430> run<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:47.650> default

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
before it starts to run and the default

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.700 
before it starts to run and the default
is<00:03:48.340> probably<00:03:48.880> fine<00:03:49.240> but<00:03:49.840> you<00:03:49.990> can<00:03:50.170> also<00:03:50.320> edit

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
is probably fine but you can also edit

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.810 
is probably fine but you can also edit
that<00:03:51.010> time<00:03:51.460> if<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.090> wish<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:54.130> whatever<00:03:54.490> time

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
that time if you wish to whatever time

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.510 
that time if you wish to whatever time
and<00:03:57.690> if<00:03:58.690> we<00:03:58.990> go<00:03:59.170> over<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.560> Settings<00:04:00.070> tab

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
and if we go over to the Settings tab

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.030 
and if we go over to the Settings tab
there's<00:04:01.450> only<00:04:01.660> one<00:04:01.810> other<00:04:02.230> thing<00:04:02.770> here<00:04:03.010> that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
there's only one other thing here that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.460 
there's only one other thing here that
you<00:04:03.280> might<00:04:03.730> want<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.120> really<00:04:04.510> change<00:04:05.020> and

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
you might want to really change and

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.670 
you might want to really change and
that's<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.610> stop<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.300> task<00:04:07.600> if<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.200> computer

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
that's to stop the task if the computer

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.000 
that's to stop the task if the computer
ceases<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.370> be<00:04:09.400> aisle<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.900> means<00:04:11.170> once

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
ceases to be aisle so that means once

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.500 
ceases to be aisle so that means once
you<00:04:12.160> come<00:04:12.370> back<00:04:12.550> to<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.820> computer<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:13.300> you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
you come back to the computer and you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.080 
you come back to the computer and you
touch<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.050> keyboard<00:04:14.230> or<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.710> mouse<00:04:15.090> you're

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
touch the keyboard or the mouse you're

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.910 
touch the keyboard or the mouse you're
starting<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.570> actively<00:04:16.989> use<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.530> computer

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
starting to actively use the computer

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.850 
starting to actively use the computer
again<00:04:18.010> it's<00:04:18.940> going<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.270> recognize<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.020> you

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
again it's going to recognize that you

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.040 
again it's going to recognize that you
want<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.250> continue<00:04:21.580> working<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.870> need

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
want to continue working and you need

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.100 
want to continue working and you need
full<00:04:23.370> power<00:04:24.370> again<00:04:24.790> to<00:04:24.940> work<00:04:25.090> with<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.900> going

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
full power again to work with it's going

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.010 
full power again to work with it's going
to<00:04:26.200> stop<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.370> task<00:04:28.290> automatically<00:04:29.940> after

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
to stop that task automatically after

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.140 
to stop that task automatically after
the<00:04:32.020> allotted<00:04:32.410> time<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:33.130> we<00:04:33.280> set<00:04:33.580> here<00:04:34.000> on

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the allotted time that we set here on

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.540 
the allotted time that we set here on
the<00:04:34.780> schedule<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.830> will<00:04:36.540> start<00:04:37.540> again

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
the schedule it will start again

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.270 
the schedule it will start again
continue<00:04:39.550> where<00:04:39.730> it<00:04:39.790> left<00:04:39.970> off<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.890> next<00:04:42.100> time

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
continue where it left off the next time

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.920 
continue where it left off the next time
you<00:04:42.370> step<00:04:42.580> away<00:04:42.730> from<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.090> computer<00:04:43.270> for<00:04:43.540> six

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
you step away from the computer for six

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.390 
you step away from the computer for six
minutes<00:04:44.140> in<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.920> case<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:47.170> that's<00:04:48.130> probably

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
minutes in this case and that's probably

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.090 
minutes in this case and that's probably
all<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:49.210> need<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.510> do<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:50.440> could<00:04:50.800> play<00:04:51.070> with

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
all you need to do you could play with
