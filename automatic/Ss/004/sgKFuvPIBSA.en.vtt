there

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
there
basically<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> list<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.480> options

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
basically you have a list of options

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.019 
basically you have a list of options
obviously<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.890> change<00:00:17.189> that<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.610> this<00:00:17.789> goes<00:00:18.000> a

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
obviously to change that so this goes a

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.189 
obviously to change that so this goes a
little<00:00:18.270> more<00:00:18.510> like<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> head<00:00:19.020> coach

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
little more like the head coach

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.499 
little more like the head coach
interface<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.580> basically<00:00:20.760> triggered

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
interface but it basically triggered

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.350 
interface but it basically triggered
through<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.710> different<00:00:23.039> options<00:00:23.160> wolf<00:00:24.150> goes

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
through the different options wolf goes

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.659 
through the different options wolf goes
to<00:00:24.630> screens<00:00:24.960> these<00:00:25.770> are<00:00:25.919> dynamic<00:00:26.099> based

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
to screens these are dynamic based

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.490 
to screens these are dynamic based
obviously<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.329> the<00:00:27.509> off<00:00:27.750> season<00:00:28.020> versus

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
obviously in the off season versus

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
obviously in the off season versus
regular<00:00:28.829> season<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.369> stuff<00:00:29.580> this

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
regular season that kind of stuff this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.390 
regular season that kind of stuff this
shows<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.599> all<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> news<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
shows you all the news up here so

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.970 
shows you all the news up here so
somebody<00:00:32.610> gets<00:00:32.820> injured<00:00:33.300> traded<00:00:34.199> cut<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
somebody gets injured traded cut that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.090 
somebody gets injured traded cut that
stuff<00:00:35.280> it'll<00:00:35.879> throw<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:37.100> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
stuff it'll throw it up there this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680 
stuff it'll throw it up there this
matches<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> weather<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.210> franchise

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
matches the weather and your franchise

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
matches the weather and your franchise
game<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.769> you<00:00:40.830> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.220> if<00:00:41.339> it's<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
game and so you can see if it's going to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
game and so you can see if it's going to
be<00:00:41.760> snowing<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.570> rainy<00:00:42.900> they've<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> stuff

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
be snowing or rainy they've got a stuff

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
be snowing or rainy they've got a stuff
and<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.400> obviously<00:00:44.730> based<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.150> where<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and it's obviously based on where you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
and it's obviously based on where you
are<00:00:45.480> shows<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.469> opponent<00:00:46.980> whatever<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
are shows your opponent whatever the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.389 
are shows your opponent whatever the
stadium<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:49.190> your<00:00:50.190> face<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> safer<00:00:51.059> online

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
stadium is your face is safer online

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.350 
stadium is your face is safer online
it's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.730> different<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it's a little different but it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
it's a little different but it's
basically<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> same<00:00:55.350> kind<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> core

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
basically using the same kind of core

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.939 
basically using the same kind of core
above

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
above

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
above
