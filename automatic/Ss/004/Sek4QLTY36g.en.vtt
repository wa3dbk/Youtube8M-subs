00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.319
 jo hi people I wanted you stop times 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.519
 show how he by when the lower or 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.620
 as you discover in minecraft 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 you can and you just need it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:23.119
 only what's down here is what it takes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:28.550
 you do not need it so if you do not need it 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:33.890
 Jesse wood is sticking to a piste rescuer 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 a lever and monastery and here that 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.090
 this one more big one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.770
 repeater that's easy that is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.309
 just a blog on it and one 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.140
 the sticky runways are a monastery here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.440
 behind it is just a sticky one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.960
 best I already said that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.969
 you see through walls so we do 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's like this 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.190
 so you can now through all walls 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 below you can see lava only 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.189
 after that you can see it down here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.549
 not and here because otherwise you come 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:16.010
 not over it now, again 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.010
 of course, then how else then 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.060
 only you press the lever fuller 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.479
 out of sight but over here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 It's not that important you can see it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:38.729
 You can see over there over there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.490
 in all directions yes that's because 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.700
 I said that in there, I did 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.770
 released a blog 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.799
 yes, it does not matter and you can do it 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.630
 just jump twice 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 I'll tell you to jump twice and so and so 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:01.369
 if you are outside then it could happen again 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:09.259
 think and it already has that one 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.259
 bauhaus 12 13.12 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.870
 in the best of the best for that for the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.960
 great view here nest here 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:32.400
 monastery that we can no longer 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:35.050
 because I then here are also still 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.480
 then here's a repeater for it 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.480
 both activated simultaneously here 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:50.610
 Let's look at it with these 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.610
 computer no longer out of this computer 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:11.800
 delay of course, delay again 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:19.270
 Redstone finally be out here 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.900
 redstone here doing a redstone now 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.160
 we will 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.620
 Now I have no wood of course 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.330
 We already have it again 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.209
 you're doing here or here here it is only 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.930
 enemies here here is right next to it 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.250
 have so you do not have as such 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.830
 return 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:51.390
 Now just about I make times 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:51.390
 front we do here and here 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:02.040
 redstone goes, we are doing wood 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.040
 that's it, he's doing that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.390
 now we start again 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.390
 into it if it would go 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:33.030
 No so what you have restored to full 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:42.960
 Rundblick now jump twice again 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:45.320
 and you're out and about again 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.729

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.810
 yes I 'll do it quickly at the gt 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.810
 quite fast 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 13 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:29.599

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:41.149
 I also need it here we can 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:47.079
 let's have one here again 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:47.079
 A monastery is here 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:59.679
 i did not say a claus from it 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:12.369
 then just give her a lift or 

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:15.529
 better said that the neck a lever 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:21.369
 then you can activate it and then 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.369
 you see the down and out of here on 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.739
 I should ask because sure and 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.439
 one of you is a park yourself 

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:32.739
 good computer and so wanted to know 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.929
 I'll ask here 

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:37.999
 This degree of what you can do differently 

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:41.779
 that minecraft works better i 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:45.409
 have these graphics in it so what you have 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.939
 maybe it could change or that's how it works 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.769
 is and what better you are 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:51.319
 could still change to minecraft 

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:54.439
 that it is better or that it is not 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.939
 sometimes act and maybe something else 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.369
 all the time with this frame 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:00.589
 has broken in now it's halfway anyway 

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.519
 good for this pc but because you have 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.889
 seen yourself 

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:06.529
 it always got stuck where 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.579
 have talked very badly like new ones 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:11.930
