00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.470 
here just gonna literally click on them
and<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.510> copy<00:02:18.750> them<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:20.480> paste

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and then going to copy them and paste

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 
and then going to copy them and paste
them<00:02:21.959> into<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.250> counts<00:02:23.520> I've<00:02:23.610> been<00:02:23.730> doing

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
them into the counts I've been doing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.690 
them into the counts I've been doing
into<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.650> my<00:02:25.650> CAD<00:02:25.860> file<00:02:26.100> okay<00:02:26.490> these<00:02:26.640> are

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
into my my CAD file okay these are

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.070 
into my my CAD file okay these are
obviously<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.690> bigger<00:02:27.959> than<00:02:28.080> my<00:02:28.170> cats<00:02:28.410> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
obviously way bigger than my cats but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.200 
obviously way bigger than my cats but
you<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.280> simply<00:02:30.400> reduce<00:02:31.030> those

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
you know I can just simply reduce those

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.170 
you know I can just simply reduce those
take<00:02:31.720> over<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.040> can<00:02:33.160> see<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.670> my

brushes palette

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.380 
brushes palette
they've<00:02:35.620> automatically<00:02:36.310> come<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.300> don't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
they've automatically come in so I don't

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.850 
they've automatically come in so I don't
have<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:37.990> anything<00:02:38.260> with<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.740> now

have to do anything with it I can now

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.540 
have to do anything with it I can now
simply<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.280> draw<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> line<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.130> there<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.430> go

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
simply just draw a line and there we go

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.120 
simply just draw a line and there we go
I<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.270> cables<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:44.350> laid<00:02:44.650> out<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:45.010> me

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
this knitwear this is going to be a bit

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
this knitwear this is going to be a bit
difficult<00:02:52.240> because<00:02:52.480> obviously<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.950> comment

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
difficult because obviously this comment

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.920 
difficult because obviously this comment
isn't<00:02:54.520> really<00:02:54.790> made<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.210> cables<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:55.720> very

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
isn't really made for cables it's very

so I can kind of show you a bit clearly

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.490 
so I can kind of show you a bit clearly
clearly<00:03:15.570> so<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.600> can<00:03:16.750> make<00:03:17.020> it<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.200> bit<00:03:17.320> more

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
clearly so I can make it a bit more

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.130 
clearly so I can make it a bit more
obvious<00:03:18.150> or<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.330> you<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.570> see<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.960> full

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
obvious or so you can see the full

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.480 
obvious or so you can see the full
effect<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.530> what<00:03:20.590> I'm<00:03:20.800> actually<00:03:20.980> going<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.310> do

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
effect of what I'm actually going to do

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.330 
effect of what I'm actually going to do
this<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.330> how<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.900> apply<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.830> brushes

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
this is how you can apply the brushes

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:34.410 
this is how you can apply the brushes
that<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.120> provided<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.140> pack<00:03:26.940> okay

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.050 

there<00:03:34.990> we<00:03:35.050> go<00:03:35.230> perfect<00:03:35.740> okay<00:03:36.400> sons<00:03:36.670> can<00:03:36.850> draw<00:03:37.030> a

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
there we go perfect okay sons can draw a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.020 
there we go perfect okay sons can draw a
line<00:03:37.270> now<00:03:37.540> let's<00:03:37.720> say<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.730> kind<00:03:39.940> of

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
line now let's say I think it kind of

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.390 
line now let's say I think it kind of
starts<00:03:40.720> probably<00:03:41.170> go<00:03:41.319> up<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.620> garment<00:03:42.069> like

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
starts probably go up the garment like

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.350 
starts probably go up the garment like
this<00:03:43.709> I'm<00:03:44.709> gonna<00:03:45.100> go<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.310> my<00:03:45.430> brushes<00:03:46.060> palette

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
this I'm gonna go to my brushes palette

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.120 
this I'm gonna go to my brushes palette
I'm<00:03:46.780> gonna<00:03:47.050> think<00:03:47.230> right<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.680> gonna<00:03:47.830> put<00:03:48.010> this

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
I'm gonna think right I'm gonna put this

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.250 
I'm gonna think right I'm gonna put this
one<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.490> okay<00:03:49.120> let's<00:03:49.630> go<00:03:49.780> for<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.050> one

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
one in okay let's go for that one

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.380 
one in okay let's go for that one
and<00:03:50.560> see<00:03:51.010> wow<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.580> absolutely<00:03:51.700> huge<00:03:52.150> it's

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
and see wow this is absolutely huge it's

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.820 
and see wow this is absolutely huge it's
obviously<00:03:52.750> ridiculous<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> size<00:03:53.680> of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
obviously ridiculous for the size of

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.710 
obviously ridiculous for the size of
garment<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.120> gonna<00:03:55.240> go<00:03:55.360> to<00:03:55.420> my<00:03:55.540> line

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
garment so and it's gonna go to my line

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.050 
garment so and it's gonna go to my line
tool<00:03:56.080> and<00:03:56.470> I'm<00:03:56.620> gonna<00:03:56.830> hit<00:03:57.040> point<00:03:57.700> two-five

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
tool and I'm gonna hit point two-five

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.610 
tool and I'm gonna hit point two-five
and<00:03:58.660> see<00:03:59.200> what<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.380> does

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
and see what that does

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.430 
and see what that does
ah<00:03:59.740> okay<00:04:00.220> there<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.400> go<00:04:00.430> that's<00:04:01.300> much<00:04:01.750> cleaner

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
ah okay there we go that's much cleaner

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.050 
ah okay there we go that's much cleaner
it's<00:04:03.160> probably<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> little<00:04:03.550> bit<00:04:03.700> too<00:04:03.730> small

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
it's probably a little bit too small

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.430 
it's probably a little bit too small
though<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:04.480> let's<00:04:04.660> go<00:04:04.810> not<00:04:05.020> point<00:04:05.290> four<00:04:06.180> okay

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
though so let's go not point four okay

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.760 
though so let's go not point four okay
that's<00:04:08.440> cool<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.080> simply<00:04:11.320> just<00:04:11.470> go<00:04:11.620> into

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
that's cool so I can simply just go into

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.050 
that's cool so I can simply just go into
my<00:04:11.860> garment<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.610> keep<00:04:12.760> doing<00:04:12.970> this

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
my garment and just keep doing this

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.979 
my garment and just keep doing this
let's<00:04:13.300> say<00:04:13.420> it's<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.660> multi<00:04:14.459> cabled<00:04:15.720> garment<00:04:16.720> or

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
let's say it's a multi cabled garment or

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.729 
let's say it's a multi cabled garment or
CAD<00:04:17.700> I'm<00:04:18.700> just<00:04:18.910> going<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:20.109> let's<00:04:20.530> pick<00:04:20.650> a

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
CAD I'm just going and let's pick a

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.750 
CAD I'm just going and let's pick a
different<00:04:20.799> one<00:04:20.980> that's<00:04:21.220> fit<00:04:21.370> for<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.549> one

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
different one that's fit for this one

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.490 
different one that's fit for this one
and<00:04:22.240> once<00:04:22.360> again<00:04:22.510> I'm<00:04:22.840> just<00:04:23.020> gonna<00:04:23.110> reduce<00:04:23.440> my

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
and once again I'm just gonna reduce my

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.490 
and once again I'm just gonna reduce my
line<00:04:23.919> size<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.520> not<00:04:24.669> point<00:04:24.910> two<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:26.290> there<00:04:26.440> we

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
line size to not point two and there we

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
line size to not point two and there we
go<00:04:26.650> fantastic<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:29.590> it's<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> very<00:04:29.950> simple<00:04:30.220> way

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
go fantastic so it's a very simple way

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.180 
go fantastic so it's a very simple way
of<00:04:30.550> putting<00:04:30.700> these<00:04:31.030> in<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:32.890> could<00:04:33.070> always

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
of putting these in and you could always

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.000 
of putting these in and you could always
create<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.580> clipping<00:04:33.880> mask<00:04:34.770> because<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.860> see

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
create a clipping mask because you see

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.230 
create a clipping mask because you see
this<00:04:36.100> is<00:04:36.160> overlapping<00:04:36.640> here<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.030> can<00:04:37.150> always

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
this is overlapping here you can always

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.730 
this is overlapping here you can always
create<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.540> clipping<00:04:37.810> mask<00:04:37.960> around<00:04:38.530> this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
create a clipping mask around this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.420 
create a clipping mask around this
outline<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:40.330> then<00:04:40.540> hold<00:04:40.960> these<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.710> place<00:04:42.190> so

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
outline to then hold these in place so

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.580 
outline to then hold these in place so
they<00:04:42.550> wouldn't<00:04:42.729> go<00:04:43.300> outside<00:04:43.540> see<00:04:44.169> that's<00:04:44.380> kind

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
they wouldn't go outside see that's kind

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.440 
they wouldn't go outside see that's kind
of<00:04:44.620> going<00:04:44.800> outside<00:04:45.010> there<00:04:45.430> so<00:04:46.060> you<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.270> use

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
of going outside there so you can use

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.210 
of going outside there so you can use
brushes<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.050> clipping<00:04:47.410> masks<00:04:47.680> together<00:04:47.979> to

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
brushes and clipping masks together to

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.370 
brushes and clipping masks together to
create<00:04:48.520> whatever<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.060> want<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.330> create<00:04:49.540> also

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
create whatever you want to create also

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.240 
create whatever you want to create also
this<00:04:51.250> line<00:04:51.580> thickness<00:04:52.300> here<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.860> actual

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
this line thickness here of the actual

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.850 
this line thickness here of the actual
artwork<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.410> things<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:56.770> this

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
artwork so this the things that this

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.590 
artwork so this the things that this
line<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.430> very<00:04:57.790> different<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.120> this<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.270> and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
line is very different to this one and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.500 
line is very different to this one and
obviously<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:58.960> want<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.320> be<00:04:59.380> cohesive<00:04:59.890> so

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
obviously you want it to be cohesive so

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.460 
obviously you want it to be cohesive so
unfortunately<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:01.570> can't<00:05:01.780> change<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.260> line

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
unfortunately I can't change the line

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.800 
unfortunately I can't change the line
thickness<00:05:02.890> of<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.220> unless<00:05:04.120> I<00:05:04.270> do<00:05:04.330> one<00:05:04.570> thing

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
thickness of this unless I do one thing

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.560 
thickness of this unless I do one thing
which<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.650> going<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.890> objects<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.700> expand

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
which is going to objects and expand

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.380 
which is going to objects and expand
once<00:05:08.470> you've<00:05:08.620> created<00:05:08.830> your<00:05:09.040> your<00:05:09.880> brush<00:05:10.150> and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
once you've created your your brush and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.450 
once you've created your your brush and
the<00:05:10.450> shape<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.810> want<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.229> be<00:05:11.350> or<00:05:11.560> your

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
the shape you want it to be or your

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.640 
the shape you want it to be or your

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
this one you can then click on that line

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.650 
this one you can then click on that line
go<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.880> object<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.810> expand<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:21.190> boom<00:05:21.660> you've

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
go to object and expand and boom you've

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.409 
go to object and expand and boom you've
now<00:05:22.960> you<00:05:23.950> can<00:05:24.130> now<00:05:24.340> edit<00:05:24.610> those<00:05:25.030> lines

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
now you can now edit those lines

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.860 
now you can now edit those lines
individually<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.490> can<00:05:27.669> now<00:05:27.760> go<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.660> I

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
individually so I can now go in and I

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.659 
individually so I can now go in and I
can<00:05:29.020> make<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.200> now<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:29.950> can<00:05:30.190> even<00:05:30.400> make<00:05:30.640> that

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
can make that now I can even make that

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.050 
can make that now I can even make that
and<00:05:31.570> they<00:05:31.660> pink<00:05:32.380> let's<00:05:32.680> say<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.820> little

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
and they pink let's say and that little

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.360 
and they pink let's say and that little
area<00:05:34.270> there<00:05:34.390> will<00:05:34.539> become<00:05:34.780> pink<00:05:35.220> but<00:05:36.220> what<00:05:36.340> I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
area there will become pink but what I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.240 
area there will become pink but what I
actually<00:05:36.580> really<00:05:37.030> want<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.300> do<00:05:37.919> so<00:05:38.919> I<00:05:38.950> guess<00:05:39.070> my

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
actually really want to do so I guess my

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.830 
actually really want to do so I guess my
big<00:05:39.400> section<00:05:39.700> tool<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:40.030> want<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.419> change<00:05:40.690> the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
big section tool I want to change the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.839 
big section tool I want to change the
thickness<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.229> this<00:05:41.350> line<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:41.860> make<00:05:41.919> it<00:05:42.460> more

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
thickness of this line and make it more

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.570 
thickness of this line and make it more
point<00:05:43.210> six

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
point six

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.940 
point six
and<00:05:44.850> now<00:05:45.090> suddenly<00:05:45.540> in<00:05:46.020> fact<00:05:46.320> let's<00:05:46.650> make<00:05:46.800> it<00:05:46.830> a

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
and now suddenly in fact let's make it a

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.260 
and now suddenly in fact let's make it a
bit<00:05:47.070> bigger<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.310> you<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:47.520> see<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.940> difference

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
bit bigger so you can see the difference

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.270 
bit bigger so you can see the difference
and<00:05:48.960> now<00:05:49.440> I<00:05:49.470> can<00:05:49.710> actually<00:05:49.830> change<00:05:50.190> the

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
and now I can actually change the

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.140 
and now I can actually change the
thickness<00:05:50.730> of<00:05:50.790> my<00:05:50.940> line<00:05:51.320> so<00:05:52.320> I'm<00:05:52.410> now<00:05:52.590> going<00:05:52.650> to

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
thickness of my line so I'm now going to

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.130 
thickness of my line so I'm now going to
expand<00:05:54.150> this<00:05:54.420> one<00:05:54.600> also<00:05:55.130> expand
