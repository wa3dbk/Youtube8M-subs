00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 he is brave indeed the holder 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 In any case, mega good mom too 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:16.440
 get sea-travel swab also hey 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.820
 I am an effective person 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.930
 survival games today shows again 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 on the edge 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.199
 We also have a theme at the start 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 try first the box there to the front 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.769
 We can do it even if it succeeds 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 and what is in there okay we have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 only two pretty but parents get 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.349
 is the armor running in any case 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.540
 ever ok I did not get any more 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.250
 okay, but it's already time for a 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.460
 beginning yes we have a topic at the start 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 yes I'm concerned with the version 1.7 and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 the 1.8 many always ask why me 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.410
 because exactly in the 1.8 games and not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 in 1.7 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.879
 so you know by now that really 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.829
 the 1.8 for the pvp area for the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.079
 minecraft pvp area really correct 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.239
 garbage is so to speak, so stop it 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 some apps really resp 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.719
 not on some also many maps one 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 for example, no longer has the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.020
 possibility to block at the same time 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.899
 you can take a 1.8 in turns 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.630
 BlockhÃ¼tten and why did I move? 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 at all on the 1.8 1.7 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.570
 why should I go today say now 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.549
 first of all here a bit the items 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.170
 and age know really really good 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.840
 In any case, knotted already works 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.909
 yes, that was just that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.400
 quick comparisons of 17 and the 18th 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 So that's why it should not be right now 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.770
 go 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.909
 You can have your opinion in the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.439
 comments write on which version he 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.110
 because it plays and whether it is with you to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.270
 example in 18 liquid runs up on me 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.829
 each case rather less so of course 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.740
 have been with me by now 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.840
 also a few bugfixes came out where 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 really no invisibility now 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.619
 has invisibility wagner has in the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.439
 once in the way far as I know 1.8 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.640
 point 3 is it I think I'm there 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.570
 I like to be wrong 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 the comments 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.159
 and yes why am I playing at all 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 the 1.8 comes on the question 1.8 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 as I think it may sound like real 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 funny but i dont know i like that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.350
 Shut up in the new years maybe 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.210
 it is one or the other of you 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 even so in the newer versions too 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.909
 play 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.250
 At some point, everyone really has to be on the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.289
 1.8 change that can be clear that it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180
 so maybe it's going well now 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.760
 in the 18 version 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.310
 which is really then in 1.8 point 10 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.379
 or so but still I find 1.8 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.620
 just not from the blocks real 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.209
 but from all so of all things 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.219
 much better designed one has to 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.329
 for example, a clearer top man 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:32.370
 stands like games com net net and 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.650
 that may be funny 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.239
 but I like the 1.8 easy 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.760
 Apart from word really from the leaks 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.950
 which in some arenas really 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.469
 it is actually true 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.269
 Cool the 1.8 to play one stops 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.450
 also the selection for example between 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.280
 had the blood that she did as well 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.730
 I do not use that right now so yes 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.549
 clear 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.099
 I'm waiting for the dialogue with and then 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.060
 also very nice and compass then 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.040
 Let's just go to the next one 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.889
 play long been media good old must 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.049
 and one has, for example, now is 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:10.590
 I now no one 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.939
 you have everything so you have for example 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.879
 also in the middle of the screen 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.500
 the countdown or the respective map 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.470
 and think reminds me but have that 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.579
 I definitely the same and well the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.859
 I should have that now 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.180
 okay, there are still a few hits 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.669
 but he has also healed 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.379
 but I now get on 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.739
 every case with the boulder and yes, too 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.720
 already poor poor alright well and it last 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.030
 So I like that in any case the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.340
 is the design of the technical if you 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.199
 that can say so much better of pvp 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.560
 technical really no way 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.509
 but I do not think so now 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.909
 it depends on whether I no longer 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.379
 can lure at the same time or so and whether 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.379
 it sometimes in the aries clearly covers that 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.699
 can be a pain on the whole, to 1.8 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.439
 definitely a cool vision 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.750
 especially because really much but stop 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:01.949
 now more and more on the university 1.38 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.759
 customer status deathmatch, too 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:08.280
 fit add to that also us 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.439
 brave yes the hit the old 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.180
 huts in any case mega good then too 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.430
 get very nice Eisenstadt also have 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.540
 again eisenstadt here but we 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.109
 We can only gold off we have 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.060
 also two very nice then that goes too 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.709
 The magic table is off, I believe 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.780
 above 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.370
 the chamber also enchanted in the deathmatch 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.160
 if there is not one, hopefully 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.430
 I hope so and we have indeed 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.400
 now before live or so with 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.509
 attributed to the golden apples holder 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.009
 the ones who want everything is you 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.900
 sword snacken let's see if I 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.789
 get I no longer get and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.750
 is now just such an arena the right 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.810
 really nice as pig so 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.849
 speak one knows yes in the ok now have 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.720
 I already won is very horny 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.449
 So directly right blatant if you are now 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.310
 Of course I do not have it like that now 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.349
 So many apps have been strong for me for a long time 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.340
 then you have bad luck but I think 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.550
 not so bad 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.039
 Anja I think they are just better 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.660
 as the 157 clearly from the pvp technical ago 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.330
 one can not compare clearly 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.500
 the 1 710 in my opinion always 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.289
 still best still difficult on 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.580
 the 1.8 and yes you are welcome your 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.500
 Write opinion in the comments 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.210
 and yes, yes , I called the green 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.949
 if you still have questions you can do the 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.659
 like to come in and yes if you 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.979
 let fell 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.460
 We'll see you back tomorrow 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.460
 and
