00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
he does still stay as overpowered is he

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
he does still stay as overpowered is he
has<00:01:40.770> been<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.189> years<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.579> sure<00:01:42.119> he<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

has been for years I'm sure he will a
barber<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> definitely<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.829> sweaty

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
barber is definitely going to be sweaty
next<00:01:44.520> year<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.479> Opie<00:01:46.020> player

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
next year so another really Opie player

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.530 
next year so another really Opie player
who<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> would<00:01:46.829> guarantee<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.060> open<00:01:48.360> next

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.410 
who I would guarantee will be open next
year<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:49.020> Musa<00:01:49.860> again<00:01:50.189> another<00:01:50.820> player<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
year is Musa again another player that

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.850 
year is Musa again another player that
doesn't<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.930> used<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.590> because

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
doesn't get used too much because

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
doesn't get used too much because
obviously<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> best<00:01:53.850> leader

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
obviously it's not in the best leader

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940 
obviously it's not in the best leader
Russian<00:01:54.570> league<00:01:54.750> isn't<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.170> best<00:01:55.439> league<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
Russian league isn't the best league and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
Russian league isn't the best league and
people<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.579> really<00:01:57.180> build<00:01:57.329> too<00:01:57.600> many

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
people don't really build too many

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
people don't really build too many
Russian<00:01:58.110> league<00:01:58.259> teams<00:01:58.530> every<00:01:59.490> time<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> have

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
Russian league teams every time I have

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
Russian league teams every time I have
built<00:02:00.329> Russian<00:02:00.659> elite<00:02:00.780> team<00:02:01.049> whether<00:02:01.290> it's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
built Russian elite team whether it's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
built Russian elite team whether it's
been<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> video<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.579> whether<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.210> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
been for a video or whether it's just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.690 
been for a video or whether it's just
been<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.659> try<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:04.049> players<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.549> Musa<00:02:05.549> has

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
been to try some players out Musa has

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.210 
been to try some players out Musa has
just<00:02:06.030> been<00:02:06.210> incredible<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.380> play<00:02:07.680> Musa

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
just been incredible when you play Musa

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.889 
just been incredible when you play Musa
with<00:02:08.369> someone<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.729> Emenike<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.599> slamming

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
with someone like Emenike for slamming

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.990 
with someone like Emenike for slamming
EK<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.619> video

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
EK is not in this video

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.790 
EK is not in this video
guess<00:02:11.150> he<00:02:11.300> will<00:02:11.480> not<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.780> envy<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.380> next<00:02:12.620> year

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
guess he will not be envy for next year

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.350 
guess he will not be envy for next year
which<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.430> real<00:02:13.640> shame<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.300> think

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
which is a real shame because I think

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.720 
which is a real shame because I think
he's<00:02:14.630> moved<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.190> guitar<00:02:16.190> or<00:02:16.340> something<00:02:16.430> like

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
he's moved to guitar or something like

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240 
he's moved to guitar or something like
that<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.120> Musa<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:17.930> just<00:02:18.380> incredible<00:02:18.980> strike

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
that but Musa is just incredible strike

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.310 
that but Musa is just incredible strike

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.460 
to be going back to the Russian league
and<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.970> obviously<00:03:05.180> what<00:03:06.080> normally<00:03:06.380> happens

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
and so obviously what normally happens

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.440 
and so obviously what normally happens
is<00:03:06.830> when<00:03:07.010> players<00:03:07.280> go<00:03:07.610> back<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.970> worse

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
is when players go back to worse

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.940 
is when players go back to worse
a-league's<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.050> i<00:03:09.080> often<00:03:09.290> get<00:03:09.560> used<00:03:09.800> too

a-league's that i often get used too

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.920 
a-league's that i often get used too
much<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.850> ratings<00:03:11.270> go<00:03:11.450> down<00:03:11.480> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
much so the ratings go down and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.300 
much so the ratings go down and
obviously<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.290> I'll<00:03:12.470> making<00:03:12.830> not<00:03:12.980> worth<00:03:13.160> as

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
obviously that I'll making not worth as

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.070 
obviously that I'll making not worth as

is<00:04:20.910> absolutely<00:04:21.540> incredible<00:04:21.750> however<00:04:22.380> at<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
is absolutely incredible however at the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.100 
is absolutely incredible however at the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
expensive because of that pace but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.790 
expensive because of that pace but
that's<00:04:27.300> what<00:04:27.480> makes<00:04:27.510> him<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.050> overpowered<00:04:28.590> the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
that's what makes him so overpowered the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.040 
that's what makes him so overpowered the
pace<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.370> finally<00:04:30.090> we<00:04:30.210> move<00:04:30.390> on<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.660> guessing
