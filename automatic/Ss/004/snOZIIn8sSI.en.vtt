jumper<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.349> know<00:00:10.639> but<00:00:11.639> right<00:00:12.540> now<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.110> all

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
jumper you know but right now it is all

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.090 
jumper you know but right now it is all
stock<00:00:15.500> it's<00:00:16.500> fine<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:18.109> it's<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> heavy

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
stock it's fine the it's kind of heavy

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.880 
stock it's fine the it's kind of heavy
I<00:00:20.130> mean<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.539> switch<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I mean if I was to switch out like the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.779 
I mean if I was to switch out like the
gears<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.090> all<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:25.519> probably<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.609> lot

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
gears and all that probably a lot

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.419 
gears and all that probably a lot
lighter<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.480> frame<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.830> super<00:00:29.250> light

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
lighter the frame is it's super light

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
lighter the frame is it's super light
but<00:00:29.789> obviously<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> can't<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.320> tell

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
but obviously you can't really tell

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.100 
but obviously you can't really tell
because<00:00:31.619> everything<00:00:32.160> else<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.880> heavy

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
because everything else is kind of heavy

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.510 
because everything else is kind of heavy
the<00:00:34.110> only<00:00:34.260> thing<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.800> bums<00:00:35.219> me<00:00:35.430> out

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the only thing that really bums me out

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.240 
the only thing that really bums me out
is<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> rims<00:00:39.469> they<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.860> double

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is that the rims they are not double

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.030 
is that the rims they are not double
walled<00:00:41.430> they're<00:00:41.670> single<00:00:42.090> walled<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
walled they're single walled so if I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.600 
walled they're single walled so if I
knock<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.460> wrong<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.940> ride<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.899> hard<00:00:46.230> so

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
knock it wrong and I ride pretty hard so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.950 
knock it wrong and I ride pretty hard so
