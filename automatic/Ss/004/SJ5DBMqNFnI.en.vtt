00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 first time you fly 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.140
 remember I had three more 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.699
 amounts I was taking the plane when 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.689

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.359
 that he spoke to me in cities is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.150
 yeah guys including to bring him 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.239
 a life of bone that happened in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 head do not eat true that's when 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.460

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.540
 from the period when I was finally finally 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.120
 I was canet in my seat like a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 great level not super finally no one sicre 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 a color that gives and we do not lose 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 traveling 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 and then of course the data you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.469
 do I'll explain bosh 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 just have to translate our two balls and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 of appeal because at montpellier 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.750
 paris paris guadeloupe 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.920
 I bet you paris montpellier and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 then you know them and summer that in the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 three meats or not imagine in a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 little paris montpellier where you go in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.989
 tea or sick 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.000
 no no because for an hour I 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.820
 swear, you're going to read newspapers the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.350
 personal dread I have my phone 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.600
 I told that nice stuff to my 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.030
 childhood on the plane let's move on to people 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.650
 who are afraid of the plane at the checkouts and 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.180
 not for the first time but it 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.380
 no use you spit the skull in 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.640
 blood is less fun anyway because 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.540
 that I will touch people extracted are 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.860
 thirty minutes of plane 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.630
 I think it's another adventure 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.590
 what do you realize to me of 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.120
 chances of a car accident 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.260
 that you have lower down after that is sure he 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.640
 are there more people taking the car 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.870
 that the plane so it's useless that I 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.830
 come say in fact but we saw it on 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.930
 still remains the means of transport 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.190
 the safest thank you google remains relaxed 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.479
 when you take a plane chewing 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.950
 gum if you want to return same site 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.540

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.220
 orders 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.210
 blizzard was there all the remotes 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.979
 when I was little there was a small 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.360
 sheep and 16 of landon me I would do that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.869
 it was to turn on the light that no 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.880
 in fact 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.229
 to be called the flight attendants we 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.009
 we are idiots but I started again 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.220
 I persisted 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:58.750

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.350
 after this message I also specify 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.119
 that the use of the mobile phone 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.920
 is totally forbidden during this flight 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.570
 there are always people who will run 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.070

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.140
