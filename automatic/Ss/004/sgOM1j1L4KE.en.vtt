00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
around YouTube now for a very long time

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660 
around YouTube now for a very long time
I<00:00:19.170> only<00:00:19.410> knew<00:00:19.619> about<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.189> past<00:00:20.250> month

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
or so but basically you got to think of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
or so but basically you got to think of
it<00:00:22.590> sort<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.189> virus<00:00:23.910> where<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> know

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it sort of like a a virus where you know

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.120 
it sort of like a a virus where you know
one<00:00:24.510> person<00:00:24.869> gets<00:00:25.019> infected<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:25.740> infect

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
one person gets infected and they infect

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.189 
one person gets infected and they infect
five<00:00:26.369> other<00:00:26.580> people<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.240> those<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:27.840> people

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
five other people and those five people

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.080 
five other people and those five people
each<00:00:28.349> infect<00:00:28.800> five<00:00:29.039> other<00:00:29.279> people<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.849> sort<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
each infect five other people so sort of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
each infect five other people so sort of
like<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.269> zombie<00:00:30.510> apocalypse<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.380> something

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
like a zombie apocalypse or something

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
like a zombie apocalypse or something

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's quite annoying sometimes because my

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.820 
it's quite annoying sometimes because my
hand<00:03:40.360> like<00:03:40.510> drags<00:03:40.870> over<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.380> I'm<00:03:41.500> writing

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
the biggest annoyance for that is trying

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.479 
the biggest annoyance for that is trying
to<00:03:44.140> play<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.320> DS<00:03:44.590> because<00:03:45.130> when<00:03:45.340> you're

left-handed you can't use the d-pad to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.340 
left-handed you can't use the d-pad to
move<00:03:48.910> right<00:03:49.360> so<00:03:49.570> people<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.290> are

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
move right so people that are

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.780 
move right so people that are
right-handed<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.100> know<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.400> play<00:03:51.579> say

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
you're playing a shooting game it's for

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.880 
you're playing a shooting game it's for
a<00:03:55.299> game<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.540> makes<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.110> use<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.470> stylus

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
a game that makes you use the stylus

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.069 
a game that makes you use the stylus
like<00:03:57.100> as<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.370> main<00:03:57.579> control<00:03:57.940> scheme<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.420> have

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
like as your main control scheme I have

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.670 
like as your main control scheme I have
to<00:03:59.230> use<00:03:59.700> these<00:04:00.700> buttons<00:04:01.090> here<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.470> can

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
to use these buttons here so that I can

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.380 
to use these buttons here so that I can
use<00:04:02.799> my<00:04:02.950> left<00:04:03.100> hand<00:04:03.340> with<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.489> Styron<00:04:03.940> stylus

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
use my left hand with the Styron stylus

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.539 
use my left hand with the Styron stylus
