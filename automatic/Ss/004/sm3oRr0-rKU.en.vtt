00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
solution which I'll show you guys how to
actually<00:01:36.030> pour<00:01:36.360> basically<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
actually pour basically what happens is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
actually pour basically what happens is
the<00:01:37.530> pressure<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> air<00:01:38.340> causes<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the pressure from the air causes the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.670 
the pressure from the air causes the
liquid<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.570> rise<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:40.079> through<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.409> little

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
liquid to rise up through this little

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
liquid to rise up through this little
tube<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.189> spray<00:01:41.579> out<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.659> really

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
tube and spray out and it's really

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
tube and spray out and it's really
really<00:01:42.990> cold<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> interesting<00:01:44.130> but

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
really cold which is interesting but

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
really cold which is interesting but
it's<00:01:44.399> nice<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.210> refreshing<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> actual

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it's nice and refreshing so the actual

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
it's nice and refreshing so the actual
solution<00:01:47.189> comes<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> big<00:01:47.729> old<00:01:47.850> bottle<00:01:48.149> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
solution comes in a big old bottle like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.499 
solution comes in a big old bottle like
this<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.430> ultra<00:01:50.909> dark<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this and this is in ultra dark it's a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.060 
this and this is in ultra dark it's a
self<00:01:51.780> tanning<00:01:52.020> micro<00:01:52.259> missed<00:01:52.619> ultra<00:01:52.890> dark

self tanning micro missed ultra dark
instant<00:01:53.610> tent<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.329> another<00:01:54.630> thing<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049

tanner is instant so you don't have to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670 
tanner is instant so you don't have to
wait<00:01:57.329> for<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.570> color<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> develop<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
wait for the color to develop and you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
wait for the color to develop and you
can<00:01:58.829> see<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.340> you're<00:01:59.490> spraying<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> which

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
can see where you're spraying it which

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
can see where you're spraying it which
is<00:02:00.299> what<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
is what I really like about it but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
is what I really like about it but
basically<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.939> take<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
basically what you do is you take the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.520 
basically what you do is you take the
little<00:02:03.479> kit<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.670> unscrew<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> bottle

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to do to activate it is press this

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.830 
to do to activate it is press this
little<00:02:34.620> button<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:34.980> top<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.629> make<00:02:36.629> sure<00:02:36.750> that

little button on top and make sure that
you're<00:02:36.930> not<00:02:36.989> tilting<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:37.470> too<00:02:37.709> much<00:02:37.859> obviously

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you're not tilting it too much obviously

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.949 
you're not tilting it too much obviously
this<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.700> very<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.090> full<00:02:39.510> you're<00:02:39.689> gonna<00:02:39.780> have

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
this is very very full you're gonna have

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.179 
this is very very full you're gonna have
a<00:02:39.989> problem<00:02:40.139> because<00:02:40.500> there's<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.829> little<00:02:40.950> like

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
a problem because there's a little like

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.339 
a problem because there's a little like
extra<00:02:42.000> hole<00:02:42.239> up<00:02:42.420> here<00:02:42.450> that'll<00:02:42.930> let<00:02:43.049> all<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
extra hole up here that'll let all the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.929 
extra hole up here that'll let all the
solution<00:02:43.709> out<00:02:43.799> if<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.220> too<00:02:44.340> full<00:02:44.549> so

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
solution out if you have it too full so

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.009 
solution out if you have it too full so
that's<00:02:45.060> why<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.209> would<00:02:45.359> like<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.510> keep<00:02:45.689> it<00:02:45.810> like

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
that's why I would like to keep it like

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.289 
that's why I would like to keep it like
either<00:02:46.200> halfway<00:02:46.739> or<00:02:46.950> way<00:02:47.340> below<00:02:47.639> that<00:02:47.879> all<00:02:48.209> you

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
either halfway or way below that all you

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.330 
either halfway or way below that all you
have<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.780> spray<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.530> press<00:02:50.220> this

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
have to do to spray it is press this

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.420 
have to do to spray it is press this
button<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:52.349> sprays<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.069> it'll<00:02:53.310> give

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
button so and it sprays and it'll give

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.710 
button so and it sprays and it'll give
you<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.579> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:53.939> a<00:02:54.060> tan<00:02:54.359> right<00:02:54.510> there

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
you a little bit of a tan right there

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.929 
you a little bit of a tan right there
and<00:02:54.959> once<00:02:55.230> again<00:02:55.349> this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.099> ultra<00:02:56.669> dark

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
and once again this is in the ultra dark

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.699 
and once again this is in the ultra dark
so<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.209> really<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.629> get<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:57.989> any<00:02:58.139> color<00:02:58.439> if

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
so you really can get it in any color if

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.110 
so you really can get it in any color if
you<00:02:58.829> don't<00:02:59.010> want<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.549> dark<00:02:59.819> with

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
you don't want it to be this dark with

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.000 
you don't want it to be this dark with
just<00:03:00.389> that<00:03:00.510> simple<00:03:00.780> amount<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.500> spray<00:03:01.769> then

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
just that simple amount of spray then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.319 
just that simple amount of spray then
you<00:03:02.099> can<00:03:02.220> get<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> lighter<00:03:02.700> color<00:03:02.819> it's<00:03:03.209> not

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
you can get a lighter color it's not

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.470 
you can get a lighter color it's not
that<00:03:03.450> big<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.599> a<00:03:03.659> deal<00:03:03.799> but<00:03:04.939> the<00:03:05.939> one<00:03:06.150> thing<00:03:06.359> I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
that big of a deal but the one thing I
