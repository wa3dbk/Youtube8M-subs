 all straps have loosened up there exactly 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.790
 heavy backpack on the thigh 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.129
 turn off and then pull up 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.559
 get started in the next step 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.199
 Are you looking for the position of yours? 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.000
 You can see the pelvic bones from the top 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.140
 Body go down the buttons there 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 it should be a bit awesome here and there 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
 then her hip belt will be brought so 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 that it encloses the front clean a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.160
 click and tighten 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 is important draw right here firmly 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.179
 not that dave kurt after that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.950
 load and movement over the hips 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.759
 slips away okay is already fast 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.400
 sometimes go here 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.680
 if that is the case you will notice here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.439
 the whole load is on the hip but 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 the load gives way back then comes 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.820
 Now the next step to the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.079
 shoulder straps if you go forward 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.450
 shoots then nothing happens and after 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 Then slide behind the shoulder 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 the straps clean by the fast 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.049
 wonderful and in the next step you can 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.579
 you then the burden of the last control 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 Get over the shoulder to the front 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.320
 so pull that just so tense 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.720
 are not too strong put on little 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.619
 let out just so that you notice the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 load up in head height shoulder height it 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.570
 fixed and not shaky or soft 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.759
 okay okay if you go now and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 take a bit out of here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.539
 the school bearer must immediately notice how 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.539
 again load is shifted to the hip 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.610
 So do not take out too much now 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.060
 Of course, it falls back again 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.489
 gone just a little bit and ok 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.040
 then you can still use the chest belt 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.450
 to the school board to fix it is 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.580
 not exactly slipped away to the side 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.750
 perfect and otherwise you can stay in here 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.849
 the side of the girth still gets the beat 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.200
 this short tighter on the hip belt 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:45.830
 fix and you have to do that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.069
 walk smoothly next 20 kilometers 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.069
