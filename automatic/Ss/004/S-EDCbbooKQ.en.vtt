this exercise is the standing squat it

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.599 
this exercise is the standing squat it
is<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> very<00:00:04.410> good<00:00:04.620> exercise<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.400> strengthen

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
is a very good exercise to strengthen

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.720 
is a very good exercise to strengthen
the<00:00:06.569> lower<00:00:07.020> body<00:00:07.350> muscles<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the lower body muscles that we have and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.919 
the lower body muscles that we have and
I'm<00:00:08.820> talking<00:00:09.150> about<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.510> muscles<00:00:09.840> that

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
I'm talking about the muscles that

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.440 
I'm talking about the muscles that
extend<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.410> hip<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.309> muscles<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.240> these

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
extend the hip the muscles here these

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.230 
extend the hip the muscles here these
muscles<00:00:12.870> extend<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.410> lower<00:00:13.590> leg<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.240> the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
muscles extend the lower leg and the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.720 
muscles extend the lower leg and the
posterior<00:00:15.809> muscles<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.560> bend<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.310> knee<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
posterior muscles that bend the knee and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.359 
posterior muscles that bend the knee and
again<00:00:18.690> there<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.740> our<00:00:20.010> mobility

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
again there these are our mobility

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.130 
again there these are our mobility
muscles<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.210> get<00:00:21.390> us<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> squatting

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
muscles and they get us from a squatting

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
muscles and they get us from a squatting
position<00:00:22.470> they<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.220> us<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.730> climbing

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
position they get us when we climbing

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
position they get us when we climbing
stairs<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:25.350> know<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.650> trying<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.010> from

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
stairs you know we're trying to get from

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.939 
stairs you know we're trying to get from
point<00:00:26.460> A<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> point<00:00:27.000> B<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:27.960> work<00:00:28.349> these

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
point A to point B we have to work these

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.640 
point A to point B we have to work these
muscles<00:00:29.240> the<00:00:30.240> exercise<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> start

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
muscles the exercise is going to start

over so here we go and we'll do a few

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370 
over so here we go and we'll do a few
repetitions<00:01:17.150> which<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.659> body<00:01:18.869> weight<00:01:19.170> and

with the dumbbells alright so my hands

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.840 
with the dumbbells alright so my hands
are<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:24.119> gauge<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.750> hips<00:01:25.020> back<00:01:25.640> hold<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
are here get gauge the hips back hold it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.499 
are here get gauge the hips back hold it
and<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.479> come<00:01:27.780> up<00:01:28.939> inhale<00:01:29.939> here

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and then come up inhale here

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.910 
and then come up inhale here
chest<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.650> good<00:01:32.009> controlled<00:01:32.460> descent<00:01:32.670> and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
chest up good controlled descent and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.780 
chest up good controlled descent and
exhale<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> way<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> lower<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.020> go

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
exhale on the way up now the lower I go

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.969 
exhale on the way up now the lower I go
the<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.110> muscles<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.799> are

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
the more I get these muscles that are

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
the more I get these muscles that are
going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.369> extend<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:42.210> hip<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> come

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
going to extend my hip and then I come

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
going to extend my hip and then I come
up<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.540> more

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
up this is going to be a little bit more

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.539 
up this is going to be a little bit more
advanced<00:01:46.110> though<00:01:46.470> probably<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
advanced though probably not going to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.510 
advanced though probably not going to
start<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.810> depth<00:01:49.520> my

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

recommendation<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.659> squat<00:01:52.049> would<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.530> go

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
recommendation on this squat would be go

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
recommendation on this squat would be go
about<00:01:53.670> six<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.240> eight<00:01:54.270> inches<00:01:54.390> hold<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
about six to eight inches hold it and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.480 
about six to eight inches hold it and
then<00:01:56.399> bring<00:01:56.640> yourself<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:58.340> all<00:01:59.340> right

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
then bring yourself back up all right

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.590 
then bring yourself back up all right
and<00:01:59.579> then<00:01:59.729> when<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.060> comfortable<00:02:00.450> with

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and then when you get comfortable with

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350 
and then when you get comfortable with
that<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.320> work<00:02:02.040> yourself<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.060> little

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that you can work yourself down a little

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.020 
that you can work yourself down a little
bit<00:02:04.009> again<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.250> important<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> make<00:02:06.000> sure

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
bit again it's important to make sure

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210 
bit again it's important to make sure
that<00:02:06.149> we<00:02:06.420> engage<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.899> hips<00:02:07.079> back<00:02:07.290> weight<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
that we engage the hips back weight on

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
that we engage the hips back weight on
the<00:02:08.340> heels<00:02:08.610> head<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.599> chest<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:11.750> good

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the heels head up chest up good

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.199 

now<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:17.040> were<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.250> use<00:02:17.400> dumbbells<00:02:17.850> for<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
now if we were to use dumbbells for this

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.680 
now if we were to use dumbbells for this
exercise<00:02:18.690> all<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.200> would<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:20.150> or<00:02:21.150> wait<00:02:21.480> it
