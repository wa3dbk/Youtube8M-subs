man-of-the-match Balotelli so first of

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.950 
man-of-the-match Balotelli so first of
all<00:00:23.880> we're<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.150> gonna<00:00:24.269> go<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.779> his

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
all we're just gonna go look at his

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
all we're just gonna go look at his
price<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.039> just<00:00:27.080> put<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.199> his<00:00:28.470> things<00:00:28.880> but

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
price if I just put in his things but

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.720 
price if I just put in his things but
yeah<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.090> did<00:00:30.599> want<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.900> start<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.679> new<00:00:32.279> series

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
yeah I did want to start a new series

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
yeah I did want to start a new series
and<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> thought<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.840> best<00:00:33.870> way<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.230> stay

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and I thought the best way to stay

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.250 
and I thought the best way to stay
active<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:35.010> probably<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> feeding

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
active would probably be to do a feeding

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.229 
active would probably be to do a feeding
series<00:00:37.469> I'd<00:00:38.100> also<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> learn<00:00:38.969> about

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
series I'd also like to learn about

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.080 
series I'd also like to learn about
trading<00:00:39.899> i<00:00:40.200> distill<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.489> would<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
trading i distill it would just be the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
trading i distill it would just be the
most<00:00:42.270> convenient<00:00:42.750> thing<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.680> we're

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
most convenient thing to do so we're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310 
most convenient thing to do so we're
going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.040> look<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.460> his<00:00:44.610> price<00:00:45.320> my

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to go look at his price my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
going to go look at his price my
supposed<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> put<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:48.440> 100<00:00:49.440> k<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:50.160> can

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
supposed to put out to 100 k so we can

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.119 
supposed to put out to 100 k so we can
just<00:00:50.460> filter<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.710> normal<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just filter out all of the normal and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.299 
just filter out all of the normal and
inform<00:00:53.969> cards<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> his<00:00:55.800> purple<00:00:56.219> I'm
