00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.240
 hoes a discipline different from all 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.650
 the others because of experience e 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.840
 interpretation of the state of mind 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.390
 of the opponent count at least as much as the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.160
 pure technique for this analysis 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.470
 of the incredible break scored by 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.330
 marcello marigliano against tom dwan may 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.670
 only a great champion can be entrusted 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 word max fishermen for this episode 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.930
 of historical hands 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:35.370
 those that it is not that it is neither volcanic 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:40.750
 this just to explain a heads up 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 television between tour player of course 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.000
 a hyper aggressive and marigliano player 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 very aggressive though maybe day 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.210
 I knew enough standard preflop 500 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.940
 1000 of course marigliano from button k9 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.480
 dry a great hand puts a 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.080
 bel 2005 rightly 2 dark and half two 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.259
 years at cappadonna makes 10,000 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.020
 marigliano rightly calls also 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.119
 because he is not one who loves very vulgar 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.960
 however also that in words however one 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:24.670
 nice hand and zap in a context of the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.860
 flop genre 368 totally off suit tom 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.920
 dwan tip 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.429
 let's say a 60 percent of the dish 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.899
 16.005 marigliano with bari there is the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.030
 purely psychology behind that while 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.160
 marry two overcards however two 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.819
 years and obvious that make a continuation 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.739
 bet 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:54.789
 so for now it's all standard 4 arrives 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:56.770
 on the turn 15 36 8 42 years thirty 6500 here 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.970
 who knows if marigliano had the intention 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.810
 of collar for then in the case of a certain 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.319
 dwan make rest bet river 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.780
 however those who love with still 145 thousand 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.410
 behind then invested about an hour 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.130
 fifty just a little above i 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 50,000 60,000 however there is still a 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.500
 140,000 behind arrives lot arrives 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 then draw to the top card that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:35.670
 is in the board 15 3 4 6 8 8 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.950
 even if of course 3368 to pop those two 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:45.050
 years tip 97,000 arriving in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.239
 he thinks quite ingeniously if 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.190
 had probably had something 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.890
 good 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.010
 two years he probably would have put up 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.010
 in 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.480
 difficult to make an episode of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.819
 genre with 50 thousand and obviously two years 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.739
 70 can never make me king in the blog is 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.430
 right there that did something 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.190
 brilliant Marigliano and surrendered only 48 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.980
 thousand from the original installment going all 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.500
 in and tom dwan folded his hand 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.310
 better then congratulations to marigliano 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.780
 a really very difficult hand 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.900
 interpret it should be asked though 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.630
 according to me that is the concept that if 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.820
 even a lot that is the top card e 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.820
 true that Maria never showed 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.410
 however, no kind of force is also 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.600
 difficult the dwan points so if he has 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.460
 a show down of a certain type 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.040
 because if he had a show for a couple of 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.930
 a certain type how could they be one 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.240
 couple of 6 probably 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.440
 he would have bet a little less 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.440
 in short, congratulations to marigliano
