redirected<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.680> we<00:02:33.830> know<00:02:34.540> based<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
redirected to and we know based on the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.180 
redirected to and we know based on the
phosphates<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.590> created<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.010> it's

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
phosphates that I created that it's

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.780 
phosphates that I created that it's
Drive<00:02:37.370> letter<00:02:37.610> e<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.240> I'll<00:02:38.780> create<00:02:39.140> a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
Drive letter e and I'll create a

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.490 
Drive letter e and I'll create a
Microsoft<00:02:40.790> Security<00:02:41.270> Essentials<00:02:41.300> folder<00:02:42.080> to

Microsoft Security Essentials folder to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.620 
Microsoft Security Essentials folder to
redirect<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.010> data<00:02:43.190> into<00:02:43.550> I'll<00:02:43.970> click<00:02:44.210> on<00:02:44.300> OK

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
redirect the data into I'll click on OK

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.270 
redirect the data into I'll click on OK
and<00:02:47.110> we<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.470> script<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.860> finished

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
and we see that the script is finished

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.340 
and we see that the script is finished
successfully<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:50.090> we'll<00:02:50.900> do<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.020> couple<00:02:51.200> of

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
successfully so we'll do a couple of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.690 
successfully so we'll do a couple of
things<00:02:51.410> here<00:02:51.800> I'm<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.340> open<00:02:52.370> up

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
has in fact been installed we see that

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.110 
has in fact been installed we see that
and<00:04:11.040> we're<00:04:12.040> now<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.340> process<00:04:12.520> of<00:04:12.910> updating

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
and we're now in the process of updating

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:22.790 
and we're now in the process of updating
the<00:04:13.860> virus<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.160> spyware<00:04:15.340> definition<00:04:16.150> files

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.400 

and<00:04:24.150> while<00:04:25.150> we<00:04:25.270> do<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.420> I'll<00:04:25.720> jump<00:04:25.930> back<00:04:25.990> into

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
and while we do that I'll jump back into

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.570 
and while we do that I'll jump back into
the<00:04:26.590> directory<00:04:27.010> here<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.370> we'll<00:04:27.460> actually

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the directory here and we'll actually

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.360 
the directory here and we'll actually
see<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.570> folders<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.590> were<00:04:29.860> created

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
see that the folders that were created

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.740 
see that the folders that were created
are<00:04:30.910> now<00:04:31.090> populated<00:04:31.660> with<00:04:31.840> data<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:38.400> and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
are now populated with data and and

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.150 
are now populated with data and and
again<00:04:40.750> we'll<00:04:41.080> see<00:04:41.290> that<00:04:41.470> there's<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.770> data

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
again we'll see that there's a data

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.590 
again we'll see that there's a data
that's<00:04:42.430> being<00:04:42.580> populated<00:04:43.240> here<00:04:43.419> in<00:04:43.540> the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
that's being populated here in the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.370 
that's being populated here in the
folders<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:46.690> a<00:04:46.750> nutshell<00:04:46.930> that's

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
folders and in a nutshell that's

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.610 
folders and in a nutshell that's
basically<00:04:47.800> how<00:04:48.070> we<00:04:48.100> redirect<00:04:48.850> data<00:04:49.500> using<00:04:50.500> fir

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
basically how we redirect data using fir

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.200 
basically how we redirect data using fir
onyx<00:04:50.890> data<00:04:51.070> igloo<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.669> this<00:04:51.760> case<00:04:51.970> we're

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
onyx data igloo and in this case we're

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.640 
onyx data igloo and in this case we're
leveraging<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.690> latest<00:04:53.020> version<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.440> data

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
leveraging the latest version of data

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.670 
leveraging the latest version of data
igloo<00:04:54.010> which<00:04:54.190> allows<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.880> scripting<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:55.810> this

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
igloo which allows for scripting of this

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.270 
igloo which allows for scripting of this
type<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:57.450> redirection<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.830> other<00:05:00.010> thing

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
type of redirection the other thing

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.540 
type of redirection the other thing
that's<00:05:00.430> really<00:05:00.520> important<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.419> note<00:05:01.600> is<00:05:01.840> that

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
that's really important to note is that

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.990 
that's really important to note is that
we<00:05:03.550> can<00:05:03.790> create<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:05.140> process<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:06.280> embed

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
we can create this process and and embed

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.159 
we can create this process and and embed
