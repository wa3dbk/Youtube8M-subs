00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.419
 those who stand by 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.469
 and so I wanted to show you today a new game called 

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:21.699
 alchemy 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.189
 so it's a basic game that makes sense that is suitable for them 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.380
 will sell ide 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.519
 so all new hp is that this period 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.280
 p 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 and he was adapted to equalize for them for a dose 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 so that's a game with a very simple principle 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.280
 we start with the four elements so fire the earth up 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.630
 and the air 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.450
 and from these three elements 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.129
 we can create 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.740
 400 investigations without elements 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.200
 so with them they did not have you d 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
 tips for additional information 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.970
 % 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.810
 we can change the language of the game too 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
 what I advise you 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.149
 so I showed you a little bit about all the things you can do 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 So that's okay with the new wat of Mario 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 here 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.720
 the waiters go to the zoo 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.900
 going through the ashtray 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.240
 Alphabetic sport 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.530
 so that's the the principle is very simple you know when you have a 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.240
 item you drag it she wants to be neat by letting it click 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 in French 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 if you want the doubled 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 simply double click on it 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.190
 if you want the handset with another man you drag it over 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.230
 for example clearer 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 it makes lava 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 and if we put water 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.500
 his wife 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 Hebert, I'm rocking, I think 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.309
 so 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.609
 at the highest for example its flora its ranks 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.759
 to the earth later pressure 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.759
 2 here 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.769
 I think it's more pressure hossa is not afraid 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.629
 well, the principle is there 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.699
 we found myself in my opinion too soon after with the party hamas which is a 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.699
 little more ahead 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.189
 here I am back so 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.399
 here is a bit more advanced in the world 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 I do not think you see my mouse I do not know me 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.189
 nice annoying if number 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.569
 so you see toothed 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.599
 using left 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.209
 % and the number of items you unlocked on 400 I unlocked 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.449
 258 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.529
 and the more you unlock and then it becomes hard 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.199
 to unlock new ones 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.650
 because there is more and more possibilities in fact 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.949
 Yes 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.949
 so you can take it already created elements 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.679
 without on the side on the side window 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:36.459
 on the left at the top 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.929
 better even 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.929
 she has it by double clicking on it or dragging it 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.579
 on time below elements 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.579
 below unlocked items there are unsuccessful items 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.930
 cease the terminal elements that's what they're in their terminal phase that 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.859
 you will not be able to combine 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.039
 m 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.990
 always 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.669
 finally it's the end 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.870
 so I took each volume 11 years at home because I'm going to do with 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:12.279
 as you want to remove items from patio was full by 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.079
 example 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.310
 I wanted to delete everything at once instead of dragging an item 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.569
 indirectly the trash you double-click on the trash in 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:21.590
 below 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.590
 there are every week in 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.659
 so you have 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.779
 it's a game if you get drunk pretty quickly I think 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.059
 because in the beginning it's very easy but the art 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.390
 to create beer with 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.240
 from alcohol 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.129
 so inevitably there is alcohol 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.129
 she who say it 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.189
 and g 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.189
 with everything I unlocked 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.889
 I tried almost everything 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.270
 hainan so if you have any ideas put it in the comments 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 it will save me from banging my head against the keyboard 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.339
 but if the harvests 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.789
 I'm proud it's not working 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.789
 correct 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.110
 Amougou 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.960
 if not 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.420
 what else can I tell you I think I went around on this 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.279
 day 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.870
 as 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.870
 you have you have two options so that you can back up 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.629
 but usually the backup is done automatically 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.650
 you want to save to several parts 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.289
 different 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.960
 so Swiss to confess charged with enlisting there 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.789
 the change is done automatically if the backup 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.400
 and in the record of the exact point 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.539
 it's not even installation it's just a bit easy 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.539
 you can change the language that I already wanted said 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.830
 you can choose from courses 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.830
 hong kong mining often that the novelties 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.499
 so for example 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.529
 the axillary unchecked 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.240
 if I try 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.850
 earth more 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.009
 ok sabeg 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.009
 there is normally cochet me I can for him and his mother 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:33.589
 yeah that's not working well 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:39.249
 normally it does that if you do 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.530
 here is the agent the élysée tick the reds and cochet 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:45.710
 and even in quantity 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.479
 more this 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.520
 more about how more fun 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.099
 it hurts while earlier it scared me 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.830
 simply because I have and I have already seen 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.909
 I'm already in the unlock item 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:58.919
 p 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.919
 and suddenly it was a novelty 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:03.949
 e 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.150
 you have the credits where we could see who if they adopted the day the 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.150
 exact point 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.289
 so here is reacted 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.289
 you also have a wikipedia link 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:18.050
 it can help 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.050
 when we run out of ideas it can help 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.999
 so 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.869
 but in the description 

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:31.269
 if I find them one because it is I had a hard time finding it all 

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:33.270
 adapted on pc 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.300
 for the first time I think this time I'm going to have a hard time too 

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:39.350
 otherwise if you 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.740
 you want to know the combinations without having to make you syrte where 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.830
 these combinations 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.830
 we tried everything possible 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.490
 I say good luck because I have 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.490
 not found yet for the exact version 

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.349
 finally the amf 

00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:01.749
 good mayor it was luciano 

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:04.749
 hoping you liked about a next video
