second they're very very very easy to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.970 
second they're very very very easy to
miss<00:02:52.200> um<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.870> is<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.050> hardest<00:02:56.500> challenge

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
miss um so that is the hardest challenge

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.720 
miss um so that is the hardest challenge
that<00:02:57.160> I've<00:02:57.280> come<00:02:57.489> across<00:02:59.130> i'm<00:03:00.130> only<00:03:00.340> at<00:03:00.430> nine

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
that I've come across i'm only at nine

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.050 
that I've come across i'm only at nine
of<00:03:00.970> 50<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.980> don't<00:03:03.130> count<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.760> ones<00:03:03.940> that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
of 50 and they don't count the ones that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.510 
of 50 and they don't count the ones that
you<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.450> beginning<00:03:05.070> won't<00:03:06.070> count<00:03:06.430> for

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
you get in the beginning won't count for

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.289 
you get in the beginning won't count for
these<00:03:06.820> challenges<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.800> if<00:03:09.430> i<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:09.760> something

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
these challenges so if i do something

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.509 
these challenges so if i do something
that<00:03:10.510> involves<00:03:10.840> these<00:03:11.200> challenges<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.070> won't

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
that involves these challenges it won't

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.650 
that involves these challenges it won't
count<00:03:12.880> while<00:03:13.269> i'm<00:03:13.330> doing<00:03:13.450> these<00:03:13.720> challenges

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
count while i'm doing these challenges

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.789 
count while i'm doing these challenges
you<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.810> only<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.230> them<00:03:17.440> when<00:03:17.620> you've

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
you can only do them when you've

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:30.479 
you can only do them when you've
unlocked<00:03:18.400> them<00:03:18.700> twitter<00:03:19.390> account<00:03:29.489> thus

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
unlocked them twitter account thus

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.759 
unlocked them twitter account thus
basically<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.570> pretty<00:03:31.870> much<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.410> like

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
basically it is pretty much just like

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:38.990 
basically it is pretty much just like
all<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:32.980> other<00:03:33.989> office<00:03:34.989> games<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.650> game

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
all the other office games this game

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.060 
all the other office games this game
unlike<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> other<00:03:40.360> ones<00:03:40.570> that<00:03:40.900> were<00:03:41.739> free

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
unlike the other ones that were free

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:49.620 
unlike the other ones that were free
this<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.519> 90<00:03:42.820> nonsense<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> go<00:03:48.130> get<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.640> if<00:03:49.000> you

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
this is 90 nonsense so go get it if you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.170 
this is 90 nonsense so go get it if you
like<00:03:49.900> it
