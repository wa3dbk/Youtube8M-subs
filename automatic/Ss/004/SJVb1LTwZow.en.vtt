from the map March for 995 for the pair
like<00:00:16.920> both<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> them<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.240> yeah<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.810> should<00:00:19.080> be

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
like both of them so yeah it should be

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:37.160

and<00:00:52.590> they're<00:00:52.739> individually<00:00:53.399> packaged<00:00:54.079> inside

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and they're individually packaged inside

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.799 
and they're individually packaged inside
the<00:00:55.649> link<00:00:55.860> up<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.629> like

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:14.149 
the link up so I'm going to do like
first<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.680> these<00:01:12.229> see<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> they're<00:01:13.920> good

first look at these see it they're good
or<00:01:14.310> anything<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> can't<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:16.890> say

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
or anything but you can't really say

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
or anything but you can't really say
that<00:01:17.880> they're<00:01:18.090> bad<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.229> good<00:01:19.380> until<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that they're bad and good until you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.789 
that they're bad and good until you
write<00:01:20.100> them<00:01:20.509> unless<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:21.990> folding

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
write them unless you see them folding

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:35.830 
write them unless you see them folding
them<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.450> gonna<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:26.509> yeah

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.480 

yeah<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.170> ones<00:01:37.350> aligned<00:01:37.680> properly<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:39.380> yeah

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
yeah that ones aligned properly so yeah

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.440 
yeah that ones aligned properly so yeah
so<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> yeah<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.149> very<00:01:45.149> cold

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
so is that one so yeah it's very cold

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.690 
so is that one so yeah it's very cold
but<00:01:45.810> they<00:01:45.960> asked<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.040> missed<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
but they asked just because I missed the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.819 
but they asked just because I missed the
first<00:01:47.939> livery<00:01:48.270> send<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.689> redelivered<00:01:49.380> today<00:01:50.070> um

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.670 

the<00:01:55.829> bushings<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.759> harder<00:01:57.750> than<00:01:57.780> my<00:01:58.020> ventures

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the bushings are harder than my ventures

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.560 
the bushings are harder than my ventures
all<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.430> might<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.880> because<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.360> cold

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
all that might just be because it's cold

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.930 
all that might just be because it's cold
but<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:02.340> since<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.240> seems<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
but from what since it seems like it is

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:14.810 
but from what since it seems like it is
harder<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> yeah<00:02:12.620> there's<00:02:13.620> says<00:02:14.490> 10

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
harder and then so yeah there's says 10

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
harder and then so yeah there's says 10
to<00:02:15.060> their<00:02:16.520> got<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:18.380> actual<00:02:19.380> logo<00:02:19.590> there<00:02:20.100> and

to their got the actual logo there and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
to their got the actual logo there and
then<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.570> bit<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:21.930> folds<00:02:22.770> into<00:02:22.920> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
then the bit where folds into it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.450 
then the bit where folds into it
kingpins<00:02:24.450> touch<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.890> comes<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.250> through

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
kingpins touch there it comes up through

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.870 
kingpins touch there it comes up through
there<00:02:26.960> yep<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.490> I'm

there yep and as you can see it I'm

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.970 
there yep and as you can see it I'm
jumbled<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.990> yeah<00:02:31.320> five<00:02:31.620> point<00:02:31.890> oh

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
jumbled if you can yeah five point oh

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.350 
jumbled if you can yeah five point oh
right<00:02:32.220> there<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.390> yeah<00:02:34.400> yeah<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.910> both<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
right there so yeah yeah the both of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.390 
right there so yeah yeah the both of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
these trucks they're 19 95s they were

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.610 
these trucks they're 19 95s they were
like<00:02:38.670> 44<00:02:39.540> pounds<00:02:44.690> 47.5<00:02:45.690> peach<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.620> guess<00:02:47.000> so

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
like 44 pounds 47.5 peach I guess so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.570 
like 44 pounds 47.5 peach I guess so
yeah<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.930> gonna<00:02:52.230> probably<00:02:52.650> write<00:02:53.250> them<00:02:53.460> an

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
yeah so I'm gonna probably write them an

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.550 
yeah so I'm gonna probably write them an
end<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.940> review<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.300> them<00:02:54.510> after<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:55.320> while

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
end or a review on them after a while

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.280 
end or a review on them after a while
but<00:02:56.160> I've<00:02:56.400> worn<00:02:56.760> them<00:02:56.880> down<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:57.930> I'll<00:02:58.110> do

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
but I've worn them down and then I'll do

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
but I've worn them down and then I'll do
a<00:02:58.320> comparison<00:02:58.860> from<00:02:59.400> these<00:02:59.730> trucks<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.270> my

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
a comparison from these trucks to my

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.720 
a comparison from these trucks to my
ventures<00:03:00.900> because<00:03:01.800> right<00:03:01.950> now<00:03:02.010> my<00:03:02.130> ventures

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
ventures because right now my ventures

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.910 
ventures because right now my ventures
um<00:03:03.470> for<00:03:04.470> some<00:03:04.650> reason<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> unaligned<00:03:05.900> like

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
um for some reason that unaligned like

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.830 
um for some reason that unaligned like
it<00:03:07.920> moves<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.360> right<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.600> push

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it moves to the right if you if you push

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.240 
it moves to the right if you if you push
out<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.200> dance<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> right<00:03:16.800> I've<00:03:16.950> changed

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
out you dance to the right I've changed

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.729 
out you dance to the right I've changed
bushings<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:17.880> everything<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.320> what
