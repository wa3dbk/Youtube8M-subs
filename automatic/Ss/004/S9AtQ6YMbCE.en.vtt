with songwriting I I tend not to I tend
not<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.549> really<00:00:05.930> worry<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:07.259> keeping<00:00:07.500> it

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
not to really worry about keeping it

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.549 
not to really worry about keeping it
just<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> myself<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.730> write<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.929> 8<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.290> 18

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
just to myself I do write the 8 the 18

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.980 
just to myself I do write the 8 the 18
for<00:00:10.769> instance<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.370> single<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> UK<00:00:12.719> you

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
for instance and single in the UK you

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.600 
for instance and single in the UK you
know<00:00:13.110> me<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> don't<00:00:13.290> need<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> they<00:00:13.860> were<00:00:13.920> 100%

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
know me I don't need you they were 100%

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.880 
know me I don't need you they were 100%
written<00:00:15.059> by<00:00:15.179> me<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.529> there's<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.590> few<00:00:16.740> other

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
written by me and there's a few other

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.109 
written by me and there's a few other
songs<00:00:17.070> like<00:00:17.250> small<00:00:17.460> bump<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> album<00:00:18.060> as

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
songs like small bump on the album as

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.099 
songs like small bump on the album as
well<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.359> there's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> lot<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> second

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
well and there's a lot on the second

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.210 
well and there's a lot on the second
album<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.680> think<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.070> good<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
album but I think it's good to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.290 
album but I think it's good to
experiment<00:00:20.850> because<00:00:22.400> I've<00:00:23.400> only<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.180> much

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
experiment because I've only got so much

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.689 
experiment because I've only got so much
experience<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:26.010> good<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.369> write<00:00:26.550> with

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
experience and it's good to write with

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.880 
experience and it's good to write with
people<00:00:27.000> good<00:00:27.359> people<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.710> had

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
people good people that have had

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.669 
people good people that have had
different<00:00:29.730> experiences<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.420> think<00:00:31.109> trying<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
different experiences I think trying to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.400 
different experiences I think trying to
force<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.070> song<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.260> good

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
force a song is is not it's not good

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.270 
force a song is is not it's not good
because<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.130> come

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
because then you're going to just come

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
because then you're going to just come
up<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.520> song<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.360> bit<00:00:36.510> bland

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
up with a song that's just a bit bland

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.360 
up with a song that's just a bit bland
and<00:00:37.079> doesn't<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.649> mean<00:00:37.800> anything<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and doesn't really mean anything to you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.979 
and doesn't really mean anything to you
I<00:00:38.399> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.329> can't<00:00:39.510> write<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> song<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I kind of if I can't write a song I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
I kind of if I can't write a song I
won't<00:00:40.110> write<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> song<00:00:40.559> I'll<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.129> wait<00:00:41.309> until

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
won't write a song I'll just wait until

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.630 
won't write a song I'll just wait until
the<00:00:41.640> time<00:00:41.850> where<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.469> inspired<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the time where I'm inspired in in that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.190 
the time where I'm inspired in in that
way<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.420> your<00:00:45.539> life's<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:46.050> really

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
way I think if your life's going really

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
way I think if your life's going really
well<00:00:46.289> you're<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.460> likely<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> write<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
well you're not really likely to write a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
well you're not really likely to write a
song<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.899> what's<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> write<00:00:49.469> about

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
song because what's there to write about

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.729 
song because what's there to write about
so<00:00:49.950> yeah<00:00:50.370> I'd<00:00:50.910> say<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.079> try<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.350> force<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
so yeah I'd say don't try and force it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.229 
so yeah I'd say don't try and force it
and<00:00:52.890> just<00:00:53.039> wait<00:00:53.899> writing<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.020> Taylor<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
and just wait writing with Taylor was a

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
and just wait writing with Taylor was a
very<00:00:57.239> different<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.870> -<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.350> -<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:58.890> any

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
very different actually - what - any any

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
very different actually - what - any any
sort<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.730> write<00:00:59.910> writing<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.600> done<00:01:00.780> before<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
sort of write writing I've done before I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
sort of write writing I've done before I
first<00:01:02.070> off<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> came<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.820> her<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.149> an<00:01:03.359> idea<00:01:03.660> and

mess up having done stuff independently
gives<00:02:54.920> me<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> lot<00:02:55.340> more<00:02:55.370> control<00:02:55.880> over<00:02:55.910> what

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
gives me a lot more control over what

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.850 
gives me a lot more control over what
happens<00:02:56.930> now<00:02:58.150> but<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> think<00:02:59.560> when<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.680> come

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
happens now but I think when you come

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.140 
happens now but I think when you come
from<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:01.100> independent<00:03:01.730> world<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.090> you

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
from that independent world and you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.130 
from that independent world and you
signed<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> major<00:03:02.540> label

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
signed to a major label

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410 
signed to a major label
you<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.130> relinquish<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.850> little<00:03:05.180> bit<00:03:05.330> of

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
you have to relinquish a little bit of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.180 
you have to relinquish a little bit of
power<00:03:05.630> because<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.860> realize<00:03:07.160> that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
power because you have to realize that

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.800 
power because you have to realize that
you're<00:03:07.519> not<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.000> one<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.510> knows<00:03:08.630> about

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
I'll tweet it but other than that it

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.810 
I'll tweet it but other than that it
tends<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.200> just<00:03:33.380> be<00:03:33.530> random<00:03:33.709> stuff<00:03:34.130> just

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
tends to just be random stuff just

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.470 
tends to just be random stuff just
keeping<00:03:35.540> people<00:03:35.570> up<00:03:35.900> updated<00:03:36.680> as<00:03:36.800> I<00:03:36.830> guess<00:03:37.480> but

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
keeping people up updated as I guess but

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.570 
keeping people up updated as I guess but
yeah<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.630> tend<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:38.959> promote<00:03:39.320> other<00:03:40.010> people's

yeah I tend to promote other people's
music<00:03:40.670> more<00:03:41.060> than<00:03:41.090> mine<00:03:41.300> which<00:03:41.980> you'll

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
music more than mine which you'll

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.250 
music more than mine which you'll
probably<00:03:43.040> rethink<00:03:43.640> yeah<00:03:44.330> I<00:03:44.600> think<00:03:45.019> it's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
probably rethink yeah I think it's

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.420 
probably rethink yeah I think it's
important<00:03:45.560> for<00:03:45.709> an<00:03:45.769> artist<00:03:45.830> to<00:03:46.070> have<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> strong

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
I'm feel more of a bond I think stars

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.510

can<00:04:02.360> often<00:04:02.600> be<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.920> distance<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
can often be in the distance and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.570 
can often be in the distance and
untouchable<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.660> think<00:04:05.840> Twitter<00:04:05.960> gives

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
untouchable and I think Twitter gives

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.860 
untouchable and I think Twitter gives
gives<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.000> opportunity<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.540> basically
