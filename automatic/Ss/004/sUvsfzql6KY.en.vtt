one finger so you guys can get it so

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:35.450 
one finger so you guys can get it so
ready<00:00:24.210> okay<00:00:25.080> whatever

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.850 

I<00:00:35.490> think<00:00:36.330> it<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.050> messaged<00:00:37.530> me<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
I think it that just messaged me and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
I think it that just messaged me and
I'll<00:00:37.980> try<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.430> remake<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.970> something<00:00:39.240> then

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
I'll try to remake it or something then

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.140 
I'll try to remake it or something then
e<00:00:39.810> then<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.740> burst<00:00:41.370> bridge<00:00:41.880> that

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
e then there's like a burst bridge that

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:52.970 
e then there's like a burst bridge that
goes<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.550> anyways<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.150> all<00:00:51.680> four<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:52.740> five

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
goes so anyways that's all four or five

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.330 
goes so anyways that's all four or five
of<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.880> two<00:00:54.090> strings<00:00:54.500> that's<00:00:55.500> five<00:00:55.890> three

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of these two strings that's five three

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.570 
of these two strings that's five three
then<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.240> goes<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.540> zero<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.530> these<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.340> like

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
then it goes to zero on these two like

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.750 
then it goes to zero on these two like
lower<00:00:59.820> lower<00:01:00.420> than<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.110> top<00:01:01.530> e<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
lower lower than the top e what we I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.640 
lower lower than the top e what we I
mean<00:01:04.910> they<00:01:05.910> go<00:01:06.090> no<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.500> goes<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
mean they go no actually goes but this

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
mean they go no actually goes but this
finger<00:01:10.979> comes<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> three<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.810> strings

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
finger comes back up to three up strings

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.240 
finger comes back up to three up strings
like<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:18.840> there's<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.790> like<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> bridge<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
like then there's a like a bridge that

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
like then there's a like a bridge that
ran<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.430> two<00:01:23.640> strings

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.550 

then<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:35.810> 5/7

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 

five-three

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
five-three

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.250 
five-three
in<00:01:43.610> five<00:01:44.610> seven<00:01:46.040> then<00:01:47.040> natural<00:01:47.610> harmonics

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
in five seven then natural harmonics

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.050 
in five seven then natural harmonics
where<00:01:49.700> five<00:01:50.990> seven<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> seven<00:01:52.830> twelve<00:01:53.400> you

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
where five seven and seven twelve you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.560 
where five seven and seven twelve you
put<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.080> bottom<00:01:56.009> metal<00:01:57.000> part<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
put it on the bottom metal part of the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.740 
put it on the bottom metal part of the
fact<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.700> don't<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.090> press<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fact and you don't actually press on you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
fact and you don't actually press on you
just<00:02:00.840> set<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.110> finger<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.440> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
just set your finger on it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:13.870 
just set your finger on it
strum<00:02:02.280> hard<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> let<00:02:03.210> go

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:27.210 

then<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.000> goes<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> beginning

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.789 

yeah<00:02:28.220> but<00:02:29.150> for<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.810> second<00:02:30.200> bridge<00:02:30.500> it

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
yeah but for the second bridge it

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.399 
yeah but for the second bridge it
doesn't<00:02:31.189> twice<00:02:31.489> because<00:02:31.930> mark<00:02:32.930> starts

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
doesn't twice because mark starts

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:46.809 
doesn't twice because mark starts
singing

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.319 

all<00:02:47.540> right<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:48.219> yeah<00:02:49.219> then<00:02:49.549> there's<00:02:49.999> a<00:02:50.060> bridge

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
all right and yeah then there's a bridge

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.699 
all right and yeah then there's a bridge
after<00:02:50.719> it<00:02:50.959> goes<00:02:51.340> after<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.579> harmonics<00:02:53.120> and

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
after it goes after the harmonics and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.099 
after it goes after the harmonics and
because<00:02:54.760> well<00:02:55.760> there's<00:02:55.909> like<00:02:56.030> oh<00:02:56.209> yeah<00:02:56.989> it's

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
because well there's like oh yeah it's

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.500 
because well there's like oh yeah it's
like<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.290> bridge<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.769> another<00:02:58.099> bridge<00:02:58.510> though

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
like a bridge like another bridge though

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.869 
like a bridge like another bridge though
it's<00:02:59.889> four<00:03:00.889> or<00:03:00.920> five<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:03.349> below<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.650> ye<00:03:04.069> the

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
it's four or five just below it ye the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.080 
it's four or five just below it ye the
strings<00:03:05.239> below<00:03:05.750> each<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.200> two<00:03:06.379> strings

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
strings below each of the two strings

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.479 
strings below each of the two strings
then<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.870> strum<00:03:09.260> them<00:03:09.439> and<00:03:09.889> then<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.189> bring

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
then you strum them and then you bring

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.599 
then you strum them and then you bring
your<00:03:10.849> ring<00:03:11.030> finger<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.769> hammer<00:03:12.769> onto<00:03:13.129> the<00:03:13.400> five

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
your ring finger in hammer onto the five

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:29.610 
your ring finger in hammer onto the five
like<00:03:14.650> then<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:15.769> get<00:03:16.189> four<00:03:16.579> again<00:03:16.989> mangoes

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.470 

then<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.890> part<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.550> like<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:32.120> lot<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.360> people

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
then this part is like a lot of people

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.780 
then this part is like a lot of people
forget<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.230> three<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.470> five<00:03:36.770> then<00:03:37.670> it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
forget it this is three and five then it

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.110 
forget it this is three and five then it
goes<00:03:37.940> back<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.300> harmonics<00:03:39.700> at<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.850> end<00:03:41.000> it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
goes back to the harmonics at the end it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.430 
goes back to the harmonics at the end it
goes

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.809 

then<00:03:44.440> there's<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.800> little<00:03:44.980> depart<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.760> I

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
then there's a little depart that I

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:46.920 
then there's a little depart that I
don't<00:03:46.120> know<00:03:46.180> what<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.360> does

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
don't know what it does
