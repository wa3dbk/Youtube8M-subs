00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
drop well it should drop I guess would

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.639

be<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.420> assume<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.230> happened<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
be what I would assume what happened to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
be what I would assume what happened to
it<00:00:52.770> especially<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.430> enough<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.300> printed

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it especially if enough of it is printed

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.010 
it especially if enough of it is printed
now<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.940> would<00:00:56.940> zoom<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> little<00:00:57.510> bit<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
now I would zoom in a little bit so you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
now I would zoom in a little bit so you
can<00:00:58.050> take<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> look<00:00:58.969> now<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.600> will

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

trade binder or having it at all when
there's<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> huge<00:02:16.769> dangerous

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
there's a huge dangerous

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.850 
there's a huge dangerous
there's<00:02:18.040> little<00:02:18.459> upside<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.720> huge<00:02:20.230> downside

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
there's little upside in a huge downside

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.400 
there's little upside in a huge downside
if<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.580> does<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:21.940> reprinted<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> lot<00:02:23.349> of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
if it does get reprinted now a lot of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.170 
if it does get reprinted now a lot of
you<00:02:23.739> say<00:02:24.010> tomboyish<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.819> stuff<00:02:25.000> like<00:02:25.120> that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
you say tomboyish and stuff like that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.360 
you say tomboyish and stuff like that
but<00:02:25.480> logically<00:02:26.050> think<00:02:26.470> about<00:02:26.769> Tom<00:02:26.980> about<00:02:27.099> for

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
but logically think about Tom about for

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.020 
but logically think about Tom about for
instance<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:28.650> Tom<00:02:29.650> award<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.190> not<00:02:30.430> reprinted

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
instance if Tom award was not reprinted

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.449 
instance if Tom award was not reprinted
it<00:02:31.239> can<00:02:31.390> easily<00:02:31.840> hit<00:02:32.080> go<00:02:32.440> from<00:02:32.709> 200<00:02:33.280> bucks

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
it can easily hit go from 200 bucks

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.699 
it can easily hit go from 200 bucks
which<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.970> was<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:35.010> 250<00:02:36.010> bucks<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.549> 300<00:02:37.510> bucks

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
which it was to 250 bucks to 300 bucks

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
which it was to 250 bucks to 300 bucks
so<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.040> reprint<00:02:39.580> not<00:02:39.819> only<00:02:40.180> pushes<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> price

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
so the reprint not only pushes the price

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.210 
so the reprint not only pushes the price
down<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:43.269> also<00:02:43.540> make<00:02:44.379> sure<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.650> price<00:02:44.950> doesn't

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
down it also make sure the price doesn't

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.710 
down it also make sure the price doesn't
go<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.849> that's<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> most<00:02:46.299> dangerous

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
go up and that's the most dangerous

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.199 
go up and that's the most dangerous
point<00:02:46.930> about<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.319> it's<00:02:47.769> not<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.700> price<00:02:48.940> going

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
point about it it's not the price going

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.110 
point about it it's not the price going
down<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.310> price<00:02:51.519> doesn't<00:02:51.760> go<00:02:51.910> up

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
down it's that the price doesn't go up

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.830 
down it's that the price doesn't go up
