it's pretty much a gimme for the first
one<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> said<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
one here but like I said you have to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
one here but like I said you have to
make<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.930> through<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.440> mine<00:00:46.680> first<00:00:47.100> to

make your way through the mine first to
get<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.210> pretty<00:00:48.450> easy<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
get there it's pretty easy it's just a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.660 
get there it's pretty easy it's just a
couple<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.649> skeletons<00:00:50.160> nothing<00:00:50.550> too

couple of skeletons nothing too

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.389 
couple of skeletons nothing too
difficult<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> dragon<00:00:52.530> itself<00:00:52.860> depends

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
difficult but the dragon itself depends

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.600 
difficult but the dragon itself depends
on<00:00:53.730> whatever<00:00:54.270> level<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.920> 81<00:00:56.399> and

there are so many different variations

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.710 
there are so many different variations
in<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.659> throughout<00:01:39.930> Skyrim<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> different

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
in this throughout Skyrim and different

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.910 
in this throughout Skyrim and different
things<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> werewolves<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
things that the werewolves can do as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
things that the werewolves can do as
well<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> vampire<00:01:44.759> Lords<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:45.420> can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
well as the vampire Lords where they can

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.000 
well as the vampire Lords where they can
just<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.020> everything

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
just see everything

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.710 
just see everything
so<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> more<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.210> guess<00:01:48.510> if<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.690> don't

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so but this is more I guess if you don't

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.070 
so but this is more I guess if you don't
have<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.380> DLC<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.330> get<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.510> shout<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
have the DLC then get this shout and

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.740 
have the DLC then get this shout and
then<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.590> says<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.130> exact<00:01:53.460> thing

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
then it just says the same exact thing

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.000 
then it just says the same exact thing
but<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> recommend<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.260> werewolf<00:01:55.590> version<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
but I recommend the werewolf version of

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.080 
but I recommend the werewolf version of
this<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.250> you're<00:01:56.370> gonna<00:01:56.490> try<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:56.910> something

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this if you're gonna try to do something

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080 
this if you're gonna try to do something
like<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:58.130> label<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.580> labels<00:01:59.940> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
like that because it label it labels the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
like that because it label it labels the
different<00:02:00.390> people<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.290> different<00:02:01.320> colors<00:02:01.920> I'm

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
different people in different colors I'm

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.260 
different people in different colors I'm
like<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.340> they're<00:02:02.460> stationary<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.090> they're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
like if they're stationary if they're

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.120 
like if they're stationary if they're
attacking<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.380> they're<00:02:04.530> looking<00:02:04.650> for<00:02:05.010> you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
attacking or if they're looking for you

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.350 
attacking or if they're looking for you
they're<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.520> different<00:02:05.610> colors<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.060> I'd

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
they're all in different colors so I'd

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.440 
they're all in different colors so I'd
recommend<00:02:06.480> that<00:02:06.840> over<00:02:07.230> or<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.100> but

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
recommend that over or is just for but

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.620 
recommend that over or is just for but
it's<00:02:09.980> basically<00:02:10.980> personal<00:02:11.400> preference<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:11.910> if

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
it's basically personal preference or if

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.850 
it's basically personal preference or if
you<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> shouts<00:02:13.680> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
that's where it gets a little bit tricky

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
pretty straightforward you know you just

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.280

sure you go in order and don't skip the
second<00:04:05.260> one<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.410> figured<00:04:05.860> I'd<00:04:05.980> just<00:04:06.130> go<00:04:06.250> all<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
second one I figured I'd just go all the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
second one I figured I'd just go all the
way<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.700> end<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:06.910> just<00:04:06.970> get<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.270> third

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
way to the end and just get the third

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.000 
way to the end and just get the third
one<00:04:07.630> and<00:04:07.660> then<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.900> get<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.140> dragon<00:04:08.440> shout<00:04:08.620> but

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
one and then I get the dragon shout but

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.350 
one and then I get the dragon shout but
the<00:04:09.130> gate<00:04:09.310> doesn't<00:04:09.550> open<00:04:09.880> unless<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.150> have

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
the gate doesn't open unless you have

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.610 
the gate doesn't open unless you have
all<00:04:10.540> three<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.080> do<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.350> in<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.470> wrong

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
all three and if you do it in the wrong

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.650 
all three and if you do it in the wrong
order<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.980> gate<00:04:12.130> won't<00:04:12.250> open<00:04:12.490> so<00:04:12.850> this<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.540> the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
order the gate won't open so this is the

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.510 
order the gate won't open so this is the
once<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.230> get<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.560> third<00:04:14.800> one<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.160> gate<00:04:15.340> will

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
once you get the third one the gate will

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.220 
once you get the third one the gate will
fall<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.150> can<00:04:16.390> get<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.660> dragon<00:04:17.049> shout

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.750 
fall and you can get the dragon shout
