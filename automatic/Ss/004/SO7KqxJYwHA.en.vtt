it<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it as you can kind of see the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.820 
it as you can kind of see the
differences<00:01:30.810> between<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:31.200> too<00:01:31.410> right<00:01:31.560> now

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
differences between them too right now

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.219 
differences between them too right now
it's<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.190> so<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.030> presence<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's just so much more presence with the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.290 
it's just so much more presence with the
650s<00:01:35.160> it's<00:01:35.490> pretty<00:01:35.700> impressive

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
650s it's pretty impressive

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.810 
650s it's pretty impressive
so<00:01:36.539> yeah<00:01:37.229> let's<00:01:37.410> take<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.680> walk<00:01:37.920> around

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.020 

so<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.770> obviously<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.399> big<00:01:44.580> change<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so you have obviously the big change is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
so you have obviously the big change is
the<00:01:45.149> front<00:01:45.390> end<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.660> looks<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the front end that looks a lot like the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.120 
the front end that looks a lot like the
p1<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.550> it's<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.960> spectacular<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
p1 and it's just really spectacular in

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.520 
p1 and it's just really spectacular in
person<00:01:50.640> gives<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.360> lot<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.660> of<00:01:52.200> an

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
person gives it a lot more of an

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
person gives it a lot more of an
aggressive<00:01:52.979> stance<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.910> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> hard

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
aggressive stance and it's kind of hard

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
aggressive stance and it's kind of hard
to<00:01:54.479> tell<00:01:54.720> unless<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.020> compare<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> two<00:01:55.709> but

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to tell unless you compare the two but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.320 
to tell unless you compare the two but
there's<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.819> less<00:01:57.000> ground

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
there's actually a lot less ground

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.359 
there's actually a lot less ground
clearance<00:01:57.690> on<00:01:57.959> the<00:01:58.020> 650s<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> with

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
clearance on the 650s and there is with

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.699 
clearance on the 650s and there is with
the<00:01:59.399> 12c<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.209> mean<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.539> not<00:02:00.630> drastic<00:02:01.259> it's

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
the 12c I mean it's not drastic it's

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.680 
the 12c I mean it's not drastic it's
still<00:02:01.920> usable<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.640> street<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
still usable for the street but this

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.389 
still usable for the street but this
front<00:02:04.229> splitter<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> definitely<00:02:05.190> like<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
front splitter is definitely like the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
front splitter is definitely like the
high<00:02:05.550> sport<00:02:05.940> version<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.569> lot<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:06.990> low

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
high sport version it's a lot more low

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.210 
high sport version it's a lot more low
to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> ground<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.240> carbon-fiber

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
