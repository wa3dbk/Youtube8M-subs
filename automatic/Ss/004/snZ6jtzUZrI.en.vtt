00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone this is the third time 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.470
 I come to find the artists of the circus 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.990
 I am at number for the fourth stage 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.759
 final of the Sardinian tour of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.130
 this spectacle of the horrors it has 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.940
 a great success for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 public 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm with the magician Denis is a mentalist 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.529
 and it is also a fakir what is the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 fakirismo summarizing this train 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.849
 physical the body trying to do things 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.990
 seemingly impossible 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.300
 we only use a small one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 our brain does not say percentage 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.649
 that we can reach 100 percent 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.260
 but already a small percentage more from 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.770
 how many years of practicing fakirism almost 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.260
 ten years 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.160
 I want to ask the wizard denis what 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.129
 Mentalism means is a technique of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 meditation or more towards psychology 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.360
 even hypnosis to illusionism 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 something you do on earth something 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 what are you doing? 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 on the viewer all you need e 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 you can perceive without use 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.650
 of the five senses is considered 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.570
 mentalism I wonder what it is that is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.510
 of a human being if you take away five 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.130
 meaning what remains of the sixth sense 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.630
 and about mentalism now 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.509
 constant thousand kits we have prepared 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 for you 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.570
 in the years I sent the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.490
 fakirismo I tried to study 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.560
 and magnetism this time i'm 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.560
 trying to use gaia 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.119
 if she 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 right now I'm trying to do 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 to perceive my spirit as a guide 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.940
 we want 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.320
 that is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.680
 it's just you and me 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.240
 you managed 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.599
 the idea is not to make him feel pain and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.599
 the rustling of the wind 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.210
 made wind on your skin you read 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.650
 I keep hearing it 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.950
 how you feel 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.690

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.890
 now the nancy is about to end and gaia 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.970
 he had to remember 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.290
 nothing because you will not see these free 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.290
 of everything that happened to them 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.790
 very shortly 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.370
 I wanted to see something actually there 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.970
 let the room say you'll see it later 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.970
 at a later time 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.650
 feel something cold aside 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.830
 feel nothing good no good 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.010
 fascism is a journey that also lasts 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.140
 many years requires a certain 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.530
 psychophysical awareness e 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.450

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.550

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:37.750
 made the lake denis what you are for 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.750
 seeing the fruit of years of study is a needle 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.060

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.810
 it's the pain of a syringe is not so much 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:06.000
 know how to endure pain but it is to succeed 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.129
 to self-harm then succeed in 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.960
 let it go against the instinct of 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.050
 survival that says don't get in the 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.319
