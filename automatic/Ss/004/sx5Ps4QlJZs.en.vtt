00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 everyone got friends with you kuzia and this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.660
 new rubric on my channel in this 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.910
 section I will compare the two supercars 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.130
 among themselves by several criteria and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 thereby you figure out which supercar 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.940
 we all know better what zentorno 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 was the best fast car in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.289
 the game has just recently released a new one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.359
 dirty money update part 1 was 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 the most expensive machine pegassi osiris 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 the cost of which was almost 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.359
 amounted to almost 2 million dollars 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
 game currency but in this video we 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.320
 let's see which car is the fastest 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.930
 self-tapping screw and pegassi osiris 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 or zentorno machine and also not immediately 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 forget to put your thumb up and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 let's start comparing the car we 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 have become without tuning all cars 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 just bought the only thing we 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.890
 built neon lights on them and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.170
 changed their coloring attacks in them all 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 tuning is worth our default 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 Battle we decided in the main airport on 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.340
 the runway in los santos but also 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.870
 actually now you see in front of you 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.120
 characteristics of two cars as you can see 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.579
 the power of one other machine is the same 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.409
 it is 750 liters per second and here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.750
 maximum speed varies 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.330
 actually osiris machine is 370 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.909
 kilometers per hour and zentorno is three hundred 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.610
 forty three kilometers per hour so this or 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.500
 No, we will see and check now 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 now check which car is faster 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 . varieties start from green lights 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 and the finish is also to green lights already in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.530
 other end of the runway 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.939
 I will watch the race from a helicopter 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 but also software again remind you that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.729
 zentorno machine costs 725 thousand dollars 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.740
 game currency and the car is worth 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.270
 almost 2 million more precisely one 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 million 950000 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.570
 game currency well, actually let's 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.570
 let's see who is faster 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.620
 but this race showed us the car 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.110
 zentorno came to the finish line faster than the car 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.760
 Osiris honestly surprised so 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.100
 the result as actually in the very 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.709
 store legendaries motorsport written 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.290
 the fact that the speed of the axis is faster than the speed 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.580
 Thornan's son is 27 kilometers per hour but on 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 In fact, we see what amber 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.200
 Sortavala razve up and confident 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.330
 actually came 1 to the finish 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 I was very interested and I 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.660
 decided to rerun the race more precisely 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 even a few races 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.320
 but actually some races even 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 I personally was driving one and the other 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.550
 Well actually the machine is now a small 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.550
 cutting these same races you will see 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.150
 but now we could see for ourselves 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.340
 the fact that zentorno supercar is faster than 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.890
 supercar a-series once again remind you 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.440
 gentoro but worth 725 thousand dollars 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.410
 game currency and axisis worth 2 million 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.050
 prices are completely different if you think 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.120
 what if the car is more expensive then it means 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.910
 it is faster and cooler then it is unfortunately 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.400
 not so gta online and also remind you that 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.410
 on site whether henry motorsport on site 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.030
 where are these cars sold themselves given a false 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.280
 maximum speed information 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.590
 machines also these machines we compared on 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.150
 Drift and brakes Well, actually nothing 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.940
 interesting in these indicators they 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 absolutely identical wanted to summarize 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.840
 of this battle if boats can be called 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.239
 really zentorno car faster 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.609
 Osiris machines are independent on difference 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.740
 cost of the car so if you have not 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.450
 a lot of money in gta online I would not 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.120
 would advise you to spend on the machine 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.540
 series as all the same machines internet 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.700
 quicker abruptly but still if you like 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.440
 would incline the seed side of the machine 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.450
 service because of the design I have you absolute 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.669
 I understand you because in my opinion 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.130
 the car is seriously much more beautiful than 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.680
 zentorno but still in speed she 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.660
 This gives the machine itself as well, and 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.730
 bonus to this video I decided to make one 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.400
 funny experiment who is faster 2 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.350
 supercar with umbrellas and Osiris and the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.479
 an accelerating plane luxor but also 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.270
 But the plane is obviously nothing unexpected. 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.800
 faster than 2 supercars riding 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.720
 maximum speed 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.430
 but it is all I thank you all for 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.320
 Watching this video I hope you 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.780
 like it also subscribe to 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.729
 my channel and write in cantor to your 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.830
 criticism i know that it should be 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.780
 much since after all this is the first release 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.850
 and write your ideas for 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.950
 criteria which we will look at 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.080
 own machine check them and i 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.780
 I think that if everything is ok if 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.669
 there will be a lot of likes, then obviously, I rather 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.130
 just release the second issue of this category 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.470
 and I will constantly actually compare 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.380
 some two supercar cars are possible 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.870
 not supercars in general, I think something 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.030
 this kind of will do continue and I 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.280
 I hope that you must write in 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.930
 comment express your opinion but also 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.030
 on this i'm all join the group 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.590
 VKontakte all important links are in 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.320
 description of this video on this i am with you 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.510
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching up on 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.510
 and roll around until all luck
