 There is always a long standing cork tell 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.959
 a few words about the Prius 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.350
 fuel consumption declared by the manufacturer 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.200
 like 3 and 9 liters in fact he 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.910
 real 6-7 but this is at Moscow pace 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.620
 movement and despite the fact that it is winter and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 that the stove is constantly working and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.720

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.550
 shows here can be seen from that camera gave 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.260
 here here shows what we are now 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.020
 drive an electric motor or 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.580
 petrol engine engines here want 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.210
 electric cross and gasoline 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 gasoline issue 99 forces electro gives out 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.330
 82 forces here there is naturally this hatch 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.980
 luxury equipment is worth a million 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.150
 870 thousand rubles base equipment costs 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.630
 from a million 380 you ride in a very country 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.550
 one and a half here there is a solar battery on 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.400
 all over the site of the Belarusian 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.459
 the station to the metro water stadium was not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.440
 no sign that indicates 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.330
 that there is somewhere paid fast 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.970
 the road would surely please those 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.700
 who is sitting here for the first time looking for this 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.530
 track like for example we we drove almost 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.080
 to the MKAD ahead only pointer to 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.330
 M10 highway there is no pointer anywhere 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.620
 about what is ahead somewhere paid 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.790
 highway this paid plot 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.349
 highway speeds kind of pride 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.870
 Moscow builders that here they are 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.579
 finally it opened left for Moscow 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.290
 this is not entirely honest research 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.079
 it turns out because the runs begin 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.700
 home to yes here we finally have them 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.930
 entrance to your 1 dolgoprudny 17 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.879
 Sheremetyevo kilometers 10 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.519
 st. petersburg 767 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.599
 we will go 120 meters per hour . behaves 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.540
 very confident 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.730
 rides great 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.439
 the track is definitely kayfovaya wide to 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.130
 Zelenograd it ten and further 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:23.060
 tapers down to 4 stripes not visible 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.470
 marks a little honestly with done in 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.820
 best with the best intentions but 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.820
 a little bit in Russian because 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.910
 because now people drive like they want 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.000
 plan to finish the whole route in 2018 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.979
 like a trough of world cup soccer 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.990
 which will be held in Russia they say that 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.660
 fare to Peter on this 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.550
 the road will be 1100-1200 rubles 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.940
 we are on the road already twenty six minutes 45 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.849
 seconds 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.650
 drive to the airport while charging 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.759
 aeroexpress 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.039
 so that's perfect 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:58.540
 absolutely not an obvious sign that there 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.330
 turn 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.340
 sign turn right here's a dude 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.990

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.770
 turn sign at airports 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.920
 after we already went to peter 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.600
 we cut out the terminal 28 minutes 18 seconds 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.440
 we were on the way 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.380
 and it was a test track m11 first 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.970
 small small area with 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.760

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.910
