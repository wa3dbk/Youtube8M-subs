they're<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.759> chips<00:00:08.630> I<00:00:08.960> threw<00:00:09.410> out<00:00:14.710> that's<00:00:15.710> a

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
they're the chips I threw out that's a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.910 
they're the chips I threw out that's a
green<00:00:16.070> LED<00:00:16.309> flashing<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:20.470> got<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.619> fault

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
green LED flashing I got the fault

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.349 
green LED flashing I got the fault
system<00:00:22.760> fault<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.050> screen<00:00:24.350> just<00:00:24.560> as<00:00:24.830> that

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
system fault and the screen just as that

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.160 
system fault and the screen just as that
that<00:00:26.359> is<00:00:26.539> all<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.840> get<00:00:27.199> no<00:00:27.500> power<00:00:28.630> no<00:00:29.630> secret

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
that is all I get no power no secret

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.330 
that is all I get no power no secret
Jones<00:00:30.910> just<00:00:31.910> fault<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.930> system<00:00:33.440> fault<00:00:36.340> the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
Jones just fault and system fault the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.870 
Jones just fault and system fault the
code<00:00:37.579> specified<00:00:38.390> on<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.809> thing<00:00:39.020> doesn't<00:00:39.440> work

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
code specified on the thing doesn't work

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.440 
code specified on the thing doesn't work
that<00:00:40.880> way<00:00:41.059> does<00:00:41.090> it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.690 

if<00:00:47.450> I<00:00:47.629> put<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.140> code<00:00:48.379> chip<00:00:48.890> in<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.579> get

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
if I put the code chip in you can get

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.360 
if I put the code chip in you can get
some<00:00:52.940> lovely<00:00:53.300> sparks<00:00:54.050> out<00:00:54.260> of<00:00:54.410> this<00:00:54.500> panel<00:00:57.370> if

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
some lovely sparks out of this panel if

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.549 
some lovely sparks out of this panel if
we<00:00:58.489> put<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.879> firmware<00:00:59.449> chip<00:00:59.930> in<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.230> its<00:01:00.350> own

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
we put the firmware chip in on its own

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:14.950 
we put the firmware chip in on its own
without<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.100> backup<00:01:13.060> find<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.210> strange<00:01:14.600> how

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
without the backup find it strange how

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.969 
without the backup find it strange how

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
to go out in the first ones to come on

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.219 
to go out in the first ones to come on
and<00:01:21.770> powerful<00:01:22.340> it's<00:01:22.520> just<00:01:22.700> on<00:01:22.850> constantly<00:01:23.450> so

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
and powerful it's just on constantly so

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:35.260 
and powerful it's just on constantly so
it<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.500> says<00:01:24.650> powering<00:01:25.610> up<00:01:25.729> please<00:01:26.150> wait

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.200 

it's<00:01:36.270> nice

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:02:04.430 

power<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:49.350> the<00:02:02.960> same<00:02:03.960> fingers

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
power it up with just the same fingers

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:28.610 
power it up with just the same fingers
with<00:02:04.650> no<00:02:05.430> chips

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.470 

I've<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.860> an<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.069> continuity<00:02:30.550> test<00:02:30.850> on<00:02:31.270> all

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
I've just an a continuity test on all

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.260 
I've just an a continuity test on all
the<00:02:31.720> fuses<00:02:32.200> they're<00:02:32.530> fine<00:02:32.800> even<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> master

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
the fuses they're fine even the master

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.820 
the fuses they're fine even the master
alarms<00:02:34.660> fuse<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:37.230> convent<00:02:38.230> worries<00:02:38.590> I've

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
alarms fuse the convent worries I've

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.370 
alarms fuse the convent worries I've
connected<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.670> earth<00:02:39.970> bond<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.050> dogs

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
connected that earth bond of the dogs

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.309 
connected that earth bond of the dogs
that<00:02:41.590> would<00:02:41.709> cut<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:46.530> piece<00:02:47.530> out<00:02:47.769> too<00:02:48.160> loud

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
that would cut that piece out too loud

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.570 
that would cut that piece out too loud
yeah<00:02:51.540> looks<00:02:52.540> fine<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.230> plot<00:02:53.470> from<00:02:53.739> there<00:02:54.430> are

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
yeah looks fine the plot from there are

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.229 
yeah looks fine the plot from there are
some<00:02:54.819> scratches<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:56.080> have<00:02:56.200> noticed

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
some scratches there that have noticed

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.850 
some scratches there that have noticed
they<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.510> look<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.900> they've<00:02:59.140> damaged<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
they don't look like they've damaged the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:11.370 
they don't look like they've damaged the
board<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.950> second<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:10.000> them<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
board and it's the second it's them the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.320 
board and it's the second it's them the
far-right<00:03:11.890> LED<00:03:12.430> there's<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.850> green<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.299> and

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
far-right LED there's the green one and

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.729 
far-right LED there's the green one and
then<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.900> middle<00:03:14.230> one<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.830> flashes

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
then it's the middle one that flashes

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.699 
then it's the middle one that flashes
that<00:03:17.739> it's<00:03:18.100> just<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.489> battery<00:03:18.700> done<00:03:19.530> I'm<00:03:20.530> just

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
that it's just a battery done I'm just

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.860 
that it's just a battery done I'm just
charging<00:03:21.160> up<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.370> certain<00:03:21.579> age<00:03:21.910> battery<00:03:22.450> just

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
charging up a certain age battery just

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.580 
charging up a certain age battery just
to<00:03:23.049> see<00:03:23.230> if<00:03:23.350> it'll<00:03:23.640> power<00:03:24.640> up<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.780> battery<00:03:25.810> if

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
to see if it'll power up the battery if

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.520 
to see if it'll power up the battery if
it's<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.190> PSU<00:03:27.730> there<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> slight<00:03:29.200> chance

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
it's the PSU there is a slight chance

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.319 
it's the PSU there is a slight chance
that<00:03:29.709> it<00:03:29.920> might<00:03:30.100> power<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.640> off<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.970> tree

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
that it might power up off of that tree

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.060 
that it might power up off of that tree
I'm<00:03:31.480> not<00:03:31.959> sure<00:03:32.260> oh<00:03:32.530> well<00:03:33.280> we'll<00:03:33.640> find<00:03:33.850> out
