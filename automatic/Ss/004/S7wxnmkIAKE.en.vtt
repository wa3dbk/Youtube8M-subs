hi<00:00:00.510> guys<00:00:00.690> Mike<00:00:00.960> Jakobi<00:00:01.350> from<00:00:01.500> point<00:00:01.740> grey<00:00:01.920> here

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hi guys Mike Jakobi from point grey here

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.100 
hi guys Mike Jakobi from point grey here
and<00:00:02.399> I'm<00:00:02.520> gonna<00:00:02.669> talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.000> two<00:00:03.480> quick<00:00:03.840> ways

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
and I'm gonna talk about two quick ways

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.960 
and I'm gonna talk about two quick ways
to<00:00:04.140> potentially<00:00:04.589> increase<00:00:05.190> your<00:00:05.670> maximum

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
to potentially increase your maximum

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.750 
to potentially increase your maximum
frame<00:00:06.509> rate<00:00:06.569> one<00:00:07.500> using<00:00:07.980> region<00:00:08.250> two<00:00:08.340> interest

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760

and<00:00:08.910> two<00:00:09.240> pixel<00:00:09.900> thinning<00:00:10.200> I'll<00:00:10.530> give<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> quick

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and two pixel thinning I'll give a quick

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.070 
and two pixel thinning I'll give a quick
explanation<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.849> each<00:00:11.969> technique<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.780> then

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
explanation for each technique and then

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:24.880 
explanation for each technique and then

effectively<00:01:17.820> reduces<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> resolution<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
effectively reduces the resolution and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
gesture tracking so let's see what the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.660 
gesture tracking so let's see what the
maximum<00:01:58.380> frame<00:01:58.619> rate<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.460> set<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
maximum frame rate would be if we set a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.139 
maximum frame rate would be if we set a
region<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> interest<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> 640<00:02:01.380> by<00:02:01.560> 480<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.700> this
