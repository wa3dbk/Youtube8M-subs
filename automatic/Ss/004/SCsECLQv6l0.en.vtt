00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 speak personal but not so well in the kitchen 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.200
 Starting, I'm Luiz and today we're going 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.809
 teach you how to make a brigadeirão 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 brigadeirão that candy that looks like 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 with a pudding and it's chocolate is very 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 easy to do 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.240
 just with some ingredients I think 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 will succeed in your home then 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.020
 let's go for the recipe we go 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.250
 start putting the ingredients in the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 blender 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.199
 then you will put the egg is put the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 condensed milk will put the cream of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.080
 milk here we are using the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.080
 sensor the same 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.270
 Then you add the butter sugar and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.539
 chocolate powder attention here folks 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 is using the powdered chocolate and not 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.210
 chocolate milk 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 If you use chocolate, it's just 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 take the sugar out of your recipe because 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
 otherwise it will get very sweet 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.100
 Now we can beat everything in the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 blender we will do it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 for about three minutes until 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 mix everything very well and if you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.090
 need only use a spatula to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.189
 to help you 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.799
 after being totally beaten, just play 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.590
 in its anointed form here we are 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.750
 using this round form of our 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.540
 hunger is a little bigger than the time here 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.030
 Do you have Brazil in Brazil? Then no stranger. 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.729
 ours will be a little lower 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.040
 than the sky is only to play then all your 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.140
 mass and now you will put on top 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.570
 otherwise because what we are going to 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.780
 make a bath here, then it's just 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 cover your first form with a paper 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.280
 aluminum or aluminum foil here is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.159
 important because if you do not put 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 it you go to to it very quickly 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.110
 and the top of his brigadeiro one is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.649
 stay very dry so do not stop using 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.840
 foil during the water bath 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.420
 so now just throw the water in your 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.820
 way the water is already hot to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 easier if she did not need to heat up 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.570
 in the oven then just fill up more or less 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.780
 one or two fingers of hot water and you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.039
 you can then take your brigadeirão 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.140
 pro phone 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.870
 he will stay in the oven for more or less 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.959
 one hour at 180 degrees 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.090
 remembering accurate in bain maria 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.819
 after an hour you will get the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.069
 foil and you will realize that the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.959
 Your Brigadier is totally fixed, that 's all. 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.849
 move a little and you will see that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.519
 he is not rocking and to have 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.500
 sure, just put a toothpick and you 're 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.319
 seeing that it is moist but not such 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.019
 totally soft that's the point you 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.750
 Do you want to put a plate on and will you? 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.670
 put these forced to the refrigerator by 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.920
 at least two hours 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.829
 It is very important to wait for the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.019
 two hours before unmolding 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.569
 then after two o'clock you're done 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.940
 I see that almost tore up 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.120
 you realize that there are still pieces 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.450
 stuck in their shape is only to help with 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.629
 a knife and you can already misinform is just 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.480
 turn and your brigadeirão is ready 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.190
 As you saw our shape is quite large. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.349
 That's why he was quiet like this. 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.560
 how are you seeing but anyway? 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.010
 It was very beautiful and to finish it was 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.680
 just put the chocolate granules 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.389
 for your brigadeirão is beautiful and 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.790
 stay perfect 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.329
 So that was our recipe today. 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.139
