00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
unfortunately we're unable to do that so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
unfortunately we're unable to do that so
it<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:39.840> became<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> cap<00:01:40.799> casualty

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it really became more of a cap casualty

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
it really became more of a cap casualty
and<00:01:42.860> we<00:01:43.860> needed<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> find<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.490> way<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:46.170> least

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and we needed to find a way to at least

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.010 
and we needed to find a way to at least
maybe<00:01:46.619> maximize<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.399> value<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> there<00:01:48.930> was

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
maybe maximize some value and there was

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
maybe maximize some value and there was
a<00:01:49.049> good<00:01:49.140> chance<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.530> he<00:01:49.619> may<00:01:49.770> leave<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
a good chance that he may leave the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.060 
a good chance that he may leave the
league<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.700> well<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.829> in

league as well but in

league as well but in
the<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.580> decision<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.180> made<00:01:54.330> in<00:01:54.540> the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.460 
years go forward in regards to CJ it's
more<00:02:02.910> centered<00:02:03.240> around<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.540> fact<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
more centered around the fact that it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.859 
more centered around the fact that it
was<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.710> be<00:02:04.800> very<00:02:04.920> difficult<00:02:05.160> to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
was going to be very difficult to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.310 
was going to be very difficult to
protect<00:02:06.869> him<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.290> our<00:02:07.320> list<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.990> it

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
protect him with our list and it was it

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.690 
protect him with our list and it was it
was<00:02:10.410> easy<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.679> us<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
was easy for us to know that there was a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.850 
was easy for us to know that there was a
lot<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:11.880> interest<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.690> player<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.770> was

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
lot of interest in the player so it was

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
lot of interest in the player so it was
more<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.130> us<00:02:14.340> maybe<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:14.850> taking<00:02:15.600> advantage

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
more of us maybe just taking advantage

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.310 
more of us maybe just taking advantage
of<00:02:16.190> getting<00:02:17.190> something<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.610> return<00:02:18.170> maybe<00:02:19.170> not

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
of getting something in return maybe not

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.510 
of getting something in return maybe not
necessarily<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.830> mood<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.250> wanted<00:02:20.490> to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
necessarily the mood that we wanted to

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.940 
necessarily the mood that we wanted to
do<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.030> again<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.780> different<00:02:22.260> mechanisms

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
do but again with different mechanisms

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.770 
do but again with different mechanisms
that<00:02:23.040> are<00:02:23.100> happening<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.670> now<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.570> was<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that are happening right now it was a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.840 
that are happening right now it was a
decision<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.770> felt<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> make<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
decision that we felt we had to make and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.479 
decision that we felt we had to make and
also<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.510> one<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.709> guess<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.370> could

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
also it is one of the I guess you could

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.220 
also it is one of the I guess you could
say<00:02:29.670> cruel<00:02:29.970> parts<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> business<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.989> terms

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
say cruel parts of the business in terms

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.190 
say cruel parts of the business in terms

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
well so yeah it's obviously very very

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440 
well so yeah it's obviously very very
hard<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:02.340> today's<00:03:02.730> sports<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.269> don't

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
hard but in today's sports and I don't

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.539 
hard but in today's sports and I don't
think<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.739> soccer<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.920> immune<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.220> it

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
think that soccer is immune to it

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.759 
think that soccer is immune to it
looking<00:03:05.880> at<00:03:06.030> football<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.900> baseball<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
looking at football and baseball and

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.170 
looking at football and baseball and
basketball<00:03:08.010> where<00:03:08.519> there's<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.760> salary-cap

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
basketball where there's a salary-cap

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.660

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
involved these are the types of things

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.150 
involved these are the types of things
that<00:03:11.790> happen<00:03:12.239> especially<00:03:12.810> with<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.980> way<00:03:14.130> our

much as barnardo's Venezuelan he's been
in<00:03:59.340> our

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
in our

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.429 
in our
in<00:03:59.879> our<00:04:00.450> league<00:04:00.629> for<00:04:00.840> quite<00:04:00.989> some<00:04:01.170> time<00:04:01.200> now

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
in our league for quite some time now

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.309 
in our league for quite some time now

and he understands the Lea understands a
system<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.920> think<00:04:05.879> he's<00:04:06.000> got<00:04:06.180> some<00:04:06.390> very<00:04:06.569> good

qualities<00:04:07.230> as<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.470> player<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:08.420> has<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
qualities as a player that is has the

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.910

ability<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.989> play<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.500> couple<00:04:10.680> different

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
ability to play a couple different

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.440 
ability to play a couple different
positions<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:13.379> know<00:04:13.500> very<00:04:13.530> athletic

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
positions you know very athletic

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.900 
positions you know very athletic
left-footed<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.889> think<00:04:16.889> solid<00:04:17.340> player<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.880> I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
left-footed I think solid player so I

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.750 
left-footed I think solid player so I
think<00:04:18.090> it's<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.329> good<00:04:18.449> addition<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:18.930> us<00:04:19.760> where

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
think it's a good addition for us where

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.730 
think it's a good addition for us where
I<00:04:20.789> think<00:04:21.120> Columbus<00:04:21.959> nah<00:04:22.139> no<00:04:22.199> one<00:04:22.320> speak<00:04:22.560> for

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
I think Columbus nah no one speak for

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
I think Columbus nah no one speak for
them<00:04:22.860> but<00:04:22.889> I<00:04:23.039> think<00:04:23.190> they<00:04:23.280> were<00:04:23.340> probably<00:04:23.580> in

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
them but I think they were probably in

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.760 
them but I think they were probably in
the<00:04:23.910> same<00:04:24.060> world<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.510> well<00:04:24.630> couldn't<00:04:25.530> protect

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the same world as well couldn't protect

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.350 
the same world as well couldn't protect
everybody<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.610> an<00:04:26.699> opportunity<00:04:27.150> to

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
everybody and it was an opportunity to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029 
everybody and it was an opportunity to
maybe<00:04:27.870> get<00:04:28.050> some<00:04:28.229> value<00:04:28.500> out<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.800> player

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
maybe get some value out of a player

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.560 
maybe get some value out of a player
that<00:04:29.070> they<00:04:29.520> they<00:04:29.820> thought<00:04:30.000> had<00:04:30.090> some<00:04:30.300> value

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
that they they thought had some value

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.210 
that they they thought had some value
around<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.840> league<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.199> we<00:04:32.010> thought<00:04:32.160> that

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
around the league and we thought that

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.850 
around the league and we thought that
and<00:04:32.820> it's<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.449> just<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.930> player<00:04:34.229> coming<00:04:34.590> in
