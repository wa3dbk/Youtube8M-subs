00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.670

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.670

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.650

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.940

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.720
 principle was boring but no longer 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.250
 because I found how to have fun, I think 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.699
 we have spent a lot of time playing 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.760
 videogames I think you're right but 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.840
 So what can we do? 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.840
 a thousand funny things 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.840
 I know what you think if we go with Adrián 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.680
 and we ask is a great idea 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680
 to look for it 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.140
 color and now we can not play 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.140
 video games that you think we can do 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.799
 look at marcela are some marbles and a 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.680
 yoyo has not seen for a long time and those 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.259
 toys are very funny is right 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.570
 colorín and best of all is that they are 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.399
 toys made here in mexico are a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.259
 tradition among the children of our 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:06.530
 country many funny hey colorín and you 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.019
 Do you know any game with marbles if 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.540
 marcela let's draw a circle in the 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.000
 land and put two marbles in each 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.150
 who the first to put another marble 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.530
 from afar it stays with all very well 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.530
 let's play 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.580
 yes 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.070
 I never thought you'll play marcela too 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.450
 I must accept that you won me hear what you 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.030
 it seems if we teach our 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 little friends how to play with the yoyo 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.680
 it's a great idea hey but you know how 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.810
 it's used I 've never done it but once I 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.890
 he shouted he told us how he was doing 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.290
 strings and it is true what you think if 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.750
 we remember and we explain to everyone 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.800
 our little friends is a good idea 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.470
 children pay close attention 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.570
 first is one of the rope so that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.570
 there is a circle in this way 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.490
 all right 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.330
 Now put the rope through the circle and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.330
 stick your finger to adjust the rope 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.450
 all right 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.940
 now wind the rope in the yoyo so 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.940
 and throw what 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.830
 two 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.210
 and that's how the yoyo is played 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.970
 forget to practice there are thousands of tricks 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.990

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.990
