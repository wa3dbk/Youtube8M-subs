00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this four foot by six foot structure you

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.539 
this four foot by six foot structure you
see<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.899> armature<00:00:04.319> for<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> canvas<00:00:05.310> I

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
see here is the armature for a canvas I

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.570 
see here is the armature for a canvas I
built<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.450> with<00:00:06.480> one<00:00:06.899> by<00:00:07.109> threes<00:00:07.500> along<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
built it with one by threes along the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490 
built it with one by threes along the
edges<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.450> by<00:00:09.630> three<00:00:09.929> si<00:00:10.139> attached

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
edges of the one by three si attached

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.770 
edges of the one by three si attached
quarter<00:00:11.040> rounds<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.450> give<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
quarter rounds this is to give the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
quarter rounds this is to give the
canvas<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.349> nice<00:00:13.530> sharp<00:00:14.009> edge<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.639> stretched

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
canvas a nice sharp edge to be stretched

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.330 
canvas a nice sharp edge to be stretched
over<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> canvas<00:00:16.590> will<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> smooth

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
over so the canvas will be a smooth

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820 
over so the canvas will be a smooth

the<00:00:24.840> structure<00:00:25.170> from<00:00:25.470> twisting<00:00:26.390> now<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:28.050> I'm

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the structure from twisting now here I'm

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.130 
the structure from twisting now here I'm
beginning<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.070> stretch<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.150> canvas<00:00:30.599> over<00:00:30.840> the

beginning to stretch the canvas over the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.130 
beginning to stretch the canvas over the
frame<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.740> cut<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> piece<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:33.149> canvas<00:00:33.450> large

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
frame I cut a piece of canvas large

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
frame I cut a piece of canvas large
enough<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> wrap<00:00:34.890> around<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.309> entire<00:00:35.399> front

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
great structure that will withstand time

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.890 
great structure that will withstand time
but<00:01:34.250> because<00:01:34.520> it's<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.030> hard<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.570> have<00:01:35.720> to

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
but because it's so hard I have to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.810 
but because it's so hard I have to
hammer<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.380> staples<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.100> get<00:01:37.250> them<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:37.580> all

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820

the way

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.260 
the way
now<00:01:39.470> I've<00:01:39.740> just<00:01:39.800> about<00:01:40.100> reached<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.760> cornice

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
now I've just about reached the cornice

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.670 
now I've just about reached the cornice
and<00:01:42.940> what<00:01:43.940> I'm<00:01:44.060> doing<00:01:44.479> with<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.990> corners<00:01:45.380> is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
and what I'm doing with the corners is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.370 
and what I'm doing with the corners is
I'm<00:01:46.070> taking<00:01:46.310> my<00:01:46.670> time<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.000> fold<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.900> excess

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'm taking my time to fold the excess

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.370 
I'm taking my time to fold the excess
fabric<00:01:48.740> over<00:01:49.160> very<00:01:49.550> neatly<00:01:49.910> it's<00:01:50.630> similar<00:01:50.960> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
fabric over very neatly it's similar to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.290 
fabric over very neatly it's similar to
folding<00:01:51.770> hospital<00:01:52.369> corners<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.180> be

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
folding hospital corners you have to be

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.600 
folding hospital corners you have to be
really<00:01:53.540> careful<00:01:53.810> at<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.320> part<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:55.280> make<00:01:55.460> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
really careful at this part to make the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.780 
really careful at this part to make the
folds<00:01:55.940> really<00:01:56.090> tight<00:01:56.540> in<00:01:56.720> perfect
