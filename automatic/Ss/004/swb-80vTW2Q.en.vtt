00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.730
 It's ok folks here one more time. 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.950
 One more video lesson 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.340
 Today I'm going to teach you access. 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.439
 your server is not your site to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.439
 through the boss of the fdp 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.320
 I'll be signing this process 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 because in the next video I'm testing 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.260
 You guys set it up quickly so I 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.390
 I'm going to make this video this first. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.870
 support is for those who have never worked 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 with ftp know how to access and then 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.649
 people to install is to provide 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 good people for this class we 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.510
 Are you going to use the death I believe? 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 that 80% of people working with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.059
 this is the most used programs 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.100
 but if you use another one a process goes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.719
 to be practically the same today 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.430
 day is also possible it is known that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:09.409
 by the browser itself, by the way, I 'm with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.409
 he opened here on it here 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.110
 already the agent will come here the first 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.979
 installed when I leave the link here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
 down 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.049
 It's ok for you guys to go down. 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 apply here the site manager already 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.240
 I have here I 'm going to die him and I'm going 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 apply a new one here a new site is the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.729
 I put time here again I was 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 doing test there time 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:45.689
 Now we go I do not go here on my 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 site is not server 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.290
 if you want to use this site he 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.210
 available from the domain to the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290
 free hosting clear up to a certain 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.719
 limit 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.299
 But you can play cool with a 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.990
 free concert that gives you 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 Do you want to train to create a website? 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 that makes it possible to 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.789
 quite something 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.340
 besides the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.060
 the pressure between the tools 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.950
 You 're there, there we go to Aquino. 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.079
 ftp access 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.180
 If I am the server it does not provide this 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:25.859
 type of tool but it is I used the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.970
 and most use the tool 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.799
 but if it does not use you will have to 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.620
 request this data here is access there 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.730
 ftp you can access twitter 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.480
 logical 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.060
 It's a password, and I 'm with him. 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.220
 it's open here we go 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:54.340
 first we will get it or if the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.530
 door in my case is this we will 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870
 leave the same thing will not set up 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.159
 nothing here in the kind of logo we'll go 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.310
 put normal 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:11.200
 and here you will ask for a user is not always 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.729
 so and I 'll put it so here I 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.549
 defined your plan in your 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:20.199
 hosting company has already set a 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.989
 password that you can change later is 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.680
 Of course we give an ok here just to 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.199
 to save 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.440
 When we come here, we 'll be there. 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:33.190
 always here our sites already the people 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.709
 will stay here equate we are 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.659
 connected to our folder to this and already has 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.190
 another lends there that I'm going to take it off 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.010
 need to install on being in the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.299

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.989
 you have the let down here is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.769
 very simple accessory to have as 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.439
 You could see that you forget that 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.120
 I liked it and signed up for the 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.069
