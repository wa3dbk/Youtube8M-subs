overload on the island expansion
generating<00:03:22.980> my<00:03:23.160> goo<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:23.760> can't<00:03:24.000> expand

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
generating my goo so we can't expand

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
generating my goo so we can't expand
this<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.110> actually<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:25.860> effective

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
this is actually a really effective

trick<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.910> know<00:03:27.000> he<00:03:27.240> would<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
trick you know he would have to get a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.870 
trick you know he would have to get a
factory<00:03:30.390> get<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:31.050> medevac<00:03:31.410> bring<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.520> medevac

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
factory get a medevac bring the medevac

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.699 
factory get a medevac bring the medevac
with<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> marine<00:03:33.480> over<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.290> shoot<00:03:34.530> away

my<00:03:34.980> overlooked<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.570> know<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.870> use<00:03:37.200> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
my overlooked or I you know just use a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380 
my overlooked or I you know just use a
Viking<00:03:37.860> from<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.280> star<00:03:38.490> fort<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.000> take<00:03:39.240> out

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
Viking from that star fort to take out

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.390 
Viking from that star fort to take out
the<00:03:39.540> overload<00:03:39.810> as<00:03:39.959> well<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> very

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
the overload as well so this is a very

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.280 
the overload as well so this is a very
good<00:03:41.490> way<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.730> denying<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.360> expansion<00:03:43.050> for

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
good way of denying and expansion for

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.180 
good way of denying and expansion for
the<00:03:43.440> Terran<00:03:47.120> my<00:03:48.120> army<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.480> very<00:03:49.290> much<00:03:49.830> bigger

the Terran my army is very much bigger

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.550 
the Terran my army is very much bigger
than<00:03:50.310> him<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.300> resources<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.140> minerals<00:03:52.470> are

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
than him the resources the minerals are

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.800 
than him the resources the minerals are
about<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.860> same<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.640> gas<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.240> heavily

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
about the same but the gas is heavily

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.080 
about the same but the gas is heavily

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:45.969 
red goo so for juggling there i'm not
even<00:04:44.599> going<00:04:44.749> to<00:04:44.810> try<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.080> protect<00:04:45.860> this

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
even going to try to protect this

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.770 
even going to try to protect this
expansion<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.699> because<00:04:46.969> my<00:04:47.150> units<00:04:47.449> are<00:04:47.599> out

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
expansion just because my units are out

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.649 
expansion just because my units are out
of<00:04:47.870> place<00:04:47.990> up<00:04:48.530> here<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:49.159> because<00:04:50.030> i<00:04:50.300> don't

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
of place up here and because i don't

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.379 
of place up here and because i don't
have<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.020> creep<00:04:51.349> to<00:04:51.650> get<00:04:52.249> nice<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:52.610> fast<00:04:53.060> on

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
have the creep to get nice and fast on

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.909 
have the creep to get nice and fast on
so<00:04:53.960> i'm<00:04:54.080> just<00:04:54.139> going<00:04:54.349> to<00:04:54.409> wait<00:04:54.590> for<00:04:54.620> him<00:04:54.889> to

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
so i'm just going to wait for him to

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.739 
so i'm just going to wait for him to
come<00:04:55.129> at<00:04:55.310> me<00:04:55.340> i<00:04:55.460> still<00:04:55.819> have<00:04:55.969> him<00:04:56.090> two<00:04:56.300> bases<00:04:56.629> to

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:56.749 
come at me i still have him two bases to

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.570 
come at me i still have him two bases to
one<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.050> I'm<00:04:57.110> not<00:04:57.229> too<00:04:57.289> worried<00:04:57.650> about<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:58.039> it

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
one so I'm not too worried about this it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.100 
one so I'm not too worried about this it
was<00:04:58.729> kind<00:04:58.909> of<00:04:58.939> just<00:04:59.090> an<00:04:59.240> extra<00:04:59.539> little<00:04:59.659> thing<00:04:59.960> I

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
was kind of just an extra little thing I

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.809 
was kind of just an extra little thing I
was<00:05:00.229> hoping<00:05:00.439> to<00:05:00.620> use<00:05:00.650> if<00:05:01.159> you<00:05:01.279> didn't<00:05:01.520> attacks

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
was hoping to use if you didn't attacks

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.149 
was hoping to use if you didn't attacks
it<00:05:02.060> but<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.110> you<00:05:03.169> check<00:05:03.319> out<00:05:03.439> the<00:05:03.499> supply<00:05:03.919> he's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
it but if you check out the supply he's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.709 
it but if you check out the supply he's
at<00:05:04.310> 70<00:05:04.699> out<00:05:04.849> of<00:05:04.879> 75<00:05:05.419> I<00:05:05.779> meant<00:05:06.319> 125<00:05:07.129> powder<00:05:07.639> 1<00:05:08.150> 32

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
at 70 out of 75 I meant 125 powder 1 32

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.629 
at 70 out of 75 I meant 125 powder 1 32
so<00:05:09.499> I<00:05:09.529> actually<00:05:09.889> should<00:05:10.129> have<00:05:10.279> placed<00:05:10.460> this

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
so I actually should have placed this

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.279 
so I actually should have placed this
hatchery<00:05:10.969> down<00:05:11.389> here<00:05:11.659> where<00:05:11.930> it's<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.169> know

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
hatchery down here where it's you know

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.499 
hatchery down here where it's you know
less<00:05:12.529> obvious<00:05:13.099> or<00:05:13.639> even<00:05:13.999> through<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.240> rocks

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
less obvious or even through the rocks

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.179 
less obvious or even through the rocks
but<00:05:14.900> I<00:05:14.930> didn't<00:05:15.259> really<00:05:15.349> need<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.770> do<00:05:15.919> that<00:05:15.949> at

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
but I didn't really need to do that at

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.100 
but I didn't really need to do that at
this<00:05:16.279> point<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:17.060> look<00:05:17.240> this<00:05:17.360> I<00:05:17.539> did<00:05:17.750> research

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
this point and look this I did research

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.689 
this point and look this I did research
borough<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.680> I've<00:05:18.800> got<00:05:18.949> eight<00:05:19.189> banelings

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
borough and I've got eight banelings

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.459 
borough and I've got eight banelings
just<00:05:19.879> kind<00:05:20.029> of<00:05:20.090> sitting<00:05:20.300> there<00:05:20.509> the<00:05:21.080> decent

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
just kind of sitting there the decent

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:23.290 
just kind of sitting there the decent
spot<00:05:21.650> because<00:05:21.830> he's<00:05:22.129> more<00:05:22.310> likely<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.699> scan<00:05:23.120> up

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
spot because he's more likely to scan up

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.659 
spot because he's more likely to scan up
here<00:05:23.569> or<00:05:23.990> up<00:05:24.229> here<00:05:24.259> he<00:05:24.800> doesn't<00:05:25.129> I<00:05:25.279> don't<00:05:25.340> think

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
here or up here he doesn't I don't think

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.129 
here or up here he doesn't I don't think
he<00:05:25.759> knows<00:05:25.909> the<00:05:26.120> fights<00:05:26.539> gonna<00:05:26.659> happen<00:05:27.020> around

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
he knows the fights gonna happen around

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.809 
he knows the fights gonna happen around
here<00:05:27.379> but<00:05:27.650> he<00:05:27.770> walks<00:05:27.979> right<00:05:28.099> over<00:05:28.460> my

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
here but he walks right over my
