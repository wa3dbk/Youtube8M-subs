left to right top to bottom and then you
notice<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.289> 100%<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> little<00:00:24.090> bit<00:00:24.210> too

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
notice that a 100% it's a little bit too

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620 
notice that a 100% it's a little bit too
big<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.869> I'll<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.140> down<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.320> 90<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:27.000> from

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
big so I'll go down to 90 and then from

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.509 
big so I'll go down to 90 and then from
there<00:00:27.840> I'd<00:00:28.050> go<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> full<00:00:28.560> screen<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
there I'd go to full screen that now I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.429 
there I'd go to full screen that now I
can<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.420> much<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.810> want<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.230> on

this<00:00:31.859> example<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.579> has<00:00:32.850> 16<00:00:33.360> around<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this example that has 16 around so

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.060 
this example that has 16 around so
you're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.290> down<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> little<00:00:34.559> bit<00:00:34.829> as

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you're going to go down a little bit as

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
you're going to go down a little bit as
a<00:00:35.100> draft<00:00:35.430> goes<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.570> need<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> see

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
a draft goes but you don't need to see

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.270 
a draft goes but you don't need to see
these<00:00:37.050> bottom<00:00:37.380> around<00:00:37.559> until<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.100> there

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
these bottom around until you get there

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
these bottom around until you get there
so<00:00:38.520> we're<00:00:39.059> fine<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.329> I'll<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> go

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
so we're fine here I'll just kind of go

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.840 
so we're fine here I'll just kind of go
through<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.010> real<00:00:41.219> quick<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.520> here's<00:00:41.730> your

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
through this real quick so here's your

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.389 
through this real quick so here's your
actual<00:00:42.149> draft<00:00:42.390> board<00:00:42.719> with<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.399> draft

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
actual draft board with the draft

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
actual draft board with the draft
position<00:00:44.670> numbers<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.690> forward<00:00:46.079> for<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
position numbers set up forward for you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.200 
position numbers set up forward for you
on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> right<00:00:47.370> hand<00:00:47.610> side<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
on the right hand side you're going to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.790 
on the right hand side you're going to
see<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.570> number<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> positions<00:00:49.200> left<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
see the number of positions left to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770 
see the number of positions left to
draft<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.820> draft<00:00:51.030> goes<00:00:51.210> along<00:00:51.510> these

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
draft so as your draft goes along these

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
draft so as your draft goes along these
are<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> decrease<00:00:52.520> actually<00:00:53.520> they're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
are going to decrease actually they're

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.740 
are going to decrease actually they're
going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> increase<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.449> goes<00:00:54.600> from

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
going to increase because it's goes from

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.180 
going to increase because it's goes from
a<00:00:54.809> negative<00:00:55.170> number<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> positive<00:00:56.070> number

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
a negative number to a positive number

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.799 
a negative number to a positive number
when<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.789> hit<00:00:56.940> 0<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.420> you've<00:00:57.660> got

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
when this hit 0 you know you've got

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.330 
when this hit 0 you know you've got
enough<00:00:58.020> quarterbacks<00:00:58.530> running<00:00:58.710> backs<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
enough quarterbacks running backs and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.160 
enough quarterbacks running backs and
this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.539> default<00:01:00.870> setup

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this is kind of just a default setup

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.830 
this is kind of just a default setup
it's<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.579> want<00:01:02.879> more<00:01:03.059> running<00:01:03.359> backs<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it's if you want more running backs and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.020 
it's if you want more running backs and
your<00:01:04.320> Y<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.619> end<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> staying<00:01:05.519> negative

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
your Y that's end up staying negative

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.250 
your Y that's end up staying negative
it's<00:01:06.240> totally<00:01:06.570> fine<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's totally fine this is just a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's totally fine this is just a
reference<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.159> where<00:01:08.790> you're<00:01:08.970> at

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
reference for you to see where you're at

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.600 
reference for you to see where you're at
what<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.600> other<00:01:09.830> managers<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:11.040> drafting

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
what your other managers are drafting

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.740 
what your other managers are drafting
and<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> kind<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> better

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and so you can kind of have a better

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
and so you can kind of have a better
feel<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.619> might<00:01:13.770> pick<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.310> later

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
feel for what they might pick in later

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
feel for what they might pick in later
rounds<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.049> decide<00:01:16.320> maybe<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.710> need

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
rounds so you can decide maybe you need

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
rounds so you can decide maybe you need
to<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.280> running<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:17.909> at

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to go out there running back when at

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.399 
to go out there running back when at
first<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.360> wanted<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.659> wider<00:01:18.840> see<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
first you wanted a wider see if it just

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.920 
first you wanted a wider see if it just
depends<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.340> try<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
depends on how you want to try you can

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450 
depends on how you want to try you can

let's go ahead and figure out who that
was<00:02:33.140> looks<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:33.920> maybe<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.220> little

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
was looks like it was maybe a little

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.540 
was looks like it was maybe a little
sean<00:02:34.940> mccoy<00:02:35.270> taken<00:02:36.110> care<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.740> now<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.400> go

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
sean mccoy taken care of and now you go

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.310 
sean mccoy taken care of and now you go
back<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.910> drive<00:02:38.180> forward<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
back to drive forward and that's that

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.380 
back to drive forward and that's that
set<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.040> put<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.400> there<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:40.760> now<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.270> have

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
set up and put in there so now you have

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.810 
set up and put in there so now you have
all<00:02:41.600> your<00:02:41.750> positions<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.830> on<00:02:43.010> as<00:02:43.190> its<00:02:43.430> as

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
all your positions going on as its as

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.480 
all your positions going on as its as
the<00:02:44.330> draft<00:02:44.570> happens<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.680> color-coordinated

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.800 
the draft happens it's color-coordinated
so<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:46.850> what<00:02:47.060> position<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.570> being

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
so you see what position is being

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.270 
so you see what position is being
drafted<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.470> kind<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.800> have<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.100> better

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

go and drive down the road and that is

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
go and drive down the road and that is
really<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.750> essence<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.200> offensive<00:02:58.160> draft

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
board it's super simple very easy and

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.920 
board it's super simple very easy and
it's<00:03:01.459> effective<00:03:02.090> because<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:02.540> doesn't<00:03:02.840> have

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it's effective because it doesn't have

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.390 
it's effective because it doesn't have
all<00:03:03.080> those<00:03:03.230> bells<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.650> whistles<00:03:04.070> doesn't<00:03:04.310> get

all those bells and whistles doesn't get

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.610 
all those bells and whistles doesn't get
all<00:03:04.490> crazy<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.240> just<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.720> meat<00:03:05.900> potatoes<00:03:06.410> of
