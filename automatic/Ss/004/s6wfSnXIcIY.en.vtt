00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.710
 welcome from the ruby you a tower 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.710
 I have all your leg 1 and 2 with me 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.070
 what would lie 1 he I'll show you like me 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.570
 to have me from basic tone to elementary school 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.030
 I explain one last video so 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.980
 we start, of course we are looking for 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.170
 that is here and if i am this im here 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.080
 have index finger then I have that 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.280
 pattern 134 which is in this 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.199
 direction can continue to play over the 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 would side we do not need so we 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.980
 yes start up here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.540
 Now I had one last video 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.280
 explains that if we go to the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.710
 Deep strings always play that way 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.710
 pattern 124 is coming here too 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.280
 I do not play that too now 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.039
 end but I'm looking here now 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.049
 the basic tone again the a and slide 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.039
 there and thus I am immediately in one 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.479
 another pattern a bit 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:31.720
 stretched out that plays now 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.590
 I could do that now 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.000
 play on 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.159
 it would be up to the basic sound here 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.690
 completely but I am already sliding 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.909
 back up for the pad at 124 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.319
 that does not have a fundamental tone I have 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.509
 but for this reason and also here in view 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.520
 and then I know that I'm here, so to speak 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.600
 that can network with the imaginary 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 pattern 134 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.840
 Now I find here the next a 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.170
 I slide the little finger 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.740
 and am immediately apart again 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.740
 stretched peter 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.930
 then lands here on the grundton 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.930
 the poor 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.920
 friends that is exciting 2 now we start up 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 the pattern 124 so the pad on that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.390
 No one red hat is in a 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.170
 minor start with pet in 1 24 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.710
 and we have found the basic tone here 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.710
 So here 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.780
 Now I'm switching sides and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.730
 this is the basic tone 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.110
 So I want to continue to play 13 4 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.110
 the reason in the index finger off 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.910
 now slippery, so to speak, an octave 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 higher again in the 124 meters pure and 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.780
 turn this way 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.720
 and now slide two volumes up because 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.990
 i have a reason here so i am 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.680
 an outstretched pattern case though 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.680
 continue to play here 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.210
 I come here to have here again 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.240
 grundton slide so that the forefinger 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.240
 back and can play again 1 34 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.680
 Just change your fingers here again 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.680
 So again 1 1 24 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.500
 i just play a chromatic one 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.780
 scale up now to the final tower 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.310
 So friends for the guitar police 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.530
 Of course, this is not an issue here 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.520
 the knowledgeable answer for the people 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.100
 they are not really that right yet 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.270
 leaked fingerboard for the recommendations 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.010
 I have the first videos again 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.180
 to look at it because I believe you are here 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.710
 that's how it starts and that's just today 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.110
 looked at that really wants 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.300
 studied and I am looking forward to 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.350
 comments of any kind of rewrites 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.950
 Maybe you also have me 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.360
 a question 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.160
 but I can still make you a video 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.240
 to a topic which was not here so far 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.500
 has been treated 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.500
 who is not that bad or
