 a constantly evolving field 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.840
 it's clear I'm a graduate farmer at the time so you do not have to 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.800
 look for someone who is involved in poultry production 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.510

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.400
 besides the pleasure 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.460
 mistrust 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.690
 havoc one is outside and can organize one's own schedule 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.770

 this is for a brief personal overview in the daily work of our 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 three main actors 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.360

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700
 biological agriculture 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.960
 this is where we come from is which country to the rich but there are some who are rather 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.190
 the challenge is to respect the limits on 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.600
 for hageman deconcentrate 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 which must not exceed 10% of the total dry matter manage it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350

 4000 places 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.420
 from the beginning like a dime have them a technical facility it be 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.420
 perfectly rational 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.460
 only a new construction therefore brings into question 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.940
 we watched what was done in conventional we then 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.450
 consulted the biological guidelines and we are asked 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.890
 what can we do to make the building simple from the point of view 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.750
 technical 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.850
 that the organic guidelines are satisfied and that the bulls is carried 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.159
 well 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.790
 ulfa advisers are familiar with the demands of agriculture 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.789
 biological approach to animal production 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.139
 in women the manufacture of organic food is an integral part 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.240
 an extensive benefits program 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.240
 and is a daily activity 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.369
 paris has in the past in this instance 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.799
 what I appreciate about women 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.889
 is that the internal support within the company works well 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.229
 it gives me confidence in the latter it allows me to worry 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.269
 everything that is important to the farmer 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.289
 in addition to the use of a good feed 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.029
 they are part of the important elements for the farmer the network 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.729
 relationships with marketing organizations 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:54.559
 the authorities the builders to pray and the bodies of advice and 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.789
 neutral experts external and would have it by the parrots surely 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.510
 this network of relationships provides access to multiple services 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.510
 easier partner organizations are able to offer 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 which is also interesting for the farmer 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.369
 tomaz boltz buys his food directly from the band 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.369
 vanquished and can one time even delivered seemed chop 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.489
 marketing organizations such case nycomed illico gets involved 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.869
 also actively support producers in the logot market and 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.269
 regularly sees new flow channels 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.109
 currently the market still needs new producers of organic pigs and 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.069
 poultry block 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.929
 in the bolen family his relationship with martin made Pharaoh kheops allowed a 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.659
 additional development 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.580
 five years 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.610
 based on the trust we developed during the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.120
 construction of the first and thomassin tables still built a 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.520
 second table it is quite exceptional that someone reacts from 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.849
 big projects in four years 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.849
 for thomas arises collaboration with ufa works well 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.260
 once is active on the market we are also heavily subject to 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.009
 market at least it is therefore an inseparable link
