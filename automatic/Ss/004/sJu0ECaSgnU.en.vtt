Shimano<00:04:23.750> Walker<00:04:24.750> look<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.950> 140<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.520> one<00:04:26.640> of

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
Shimano Walker look to 140 it's one of

Shimano Walker look to 140 it's one of
the<00:04:26.790> only<00:04:26.940> sinking<00:04:27.450> ones<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.840> their<00:04:27.960> range<00:04:28.230> so

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
the only sinking ones in their range so

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.770 
the only sinking ones in their range so
it's<00:04:29.880> good<00:04:30.150> because<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.570> bit

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
it's good because it's a little bit

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's good because it's a little bit
bigger<00:04:31.080> than<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.410> average<00:04:31.530> ones<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.250> you

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
bigger than the average ones and you

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.150 
bigger than the average ones and you
know<00:04:33.210> might<00:04:33.450> be<00:04:33.480> comparable<00:04:34.080> with<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.980> guy

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
know might be comparable with this guy

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.580 
know might be comparable with this guy
here<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:36.510> what<00:04:36.720> you're<00:04:36.840> likely<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.290> do<00:04:37.440> with

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
here in in what you're likely to do with

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.060 
here in in what you're likely to do with
it

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.670 
it
but<00:04:38.400> vastly<00:04:38.850> less<00:04:39.030> expensive<00:04:39.630> so<00:04:39.900> if<00:04:40.530> you're

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
but vastly less expensive so if you're

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.050 
but vastly less expensive so if you're
in<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.800> situation<00:04:40.980> where<00:04:41.370> there's<00:04:41.640> some<00:04:41.730> makkal

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
in a situation where there's some makkal

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.550 
in a situation where there's some makkal
around<00:04:42.330> or<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.810> just<00:04:42.930> haven't<00:04:43.170> got<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
around or you just haven't got the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.430 
around or you just haven't got the
budget<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.700> stretch<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> really

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
budget to stretch to the really

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.500 
budget to stretch to the really
expensive<00:04:46.440> exotica<00:04:47.100> then<00:04:47.610> Jame<00:04:48.000> laws<00:04:48.300> like

expensive exotica then Jame laws like

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.470 
expensive exotica then Jame laws like
this<00:04:48.660> are<00:04:48.900> certainly<00:04:49.440> well<00:04:49.680> worth<00:04:49.860> your<00:04:50.070> while

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
this are certainly well worth your while

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.610 
this are certainly well worth your while
we<00:04:51.480> kind<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.810> think<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.020> these<00:04:52.170> learners<00:04:52.410> as

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
we kind of think of these learners as

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.920 
we kind of think of these learners as
twitching<00:04:53.220> baits<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.150> they're<00:04:54.330> not<00:04:54.600> baits

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
twitching baits so they're not baits

twitching baits so they're not baits
that<00:04:55.230> we<00:04:55.350> would<00:04:55.590> use<00:04:56.130> like<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.640> chrome<00:04:57.030> slug<00:04:57.390> now

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
that we would use like a chrome slug now

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.630 
that we would use like a chrome slug now
we<00:04:58.110> don't<00:04:58.260> cast<00:04:58.560> them<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:58.950> flat<00:04:59.160> wide<00:04:59.400> them

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
we don't cast them and flat wide them
