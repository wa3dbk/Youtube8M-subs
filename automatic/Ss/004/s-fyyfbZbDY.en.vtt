00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.390
 that a boys as they are I hope that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.940
 are very good, well, here they are 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.339
 I bring new video as I told you in my 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429
 page I'm going to start uploading hacks now 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:17.250
 they restarted me as they could see 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.619
 some time ago and then I bring you a hack of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.680
 dragons for 25 dragon gems that what 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.660
 have gone out and I will upload several 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.750
 that they can get good first what 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.130
 what you have to do is take our 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.910
 on facebook there is of the there is of a game 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.230
 and the Haitian session we copied that already the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.420
 I have previously copied 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.510
 here you can see them in my blog of notes 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.970
 and here the facebook aid and we copy it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.360
 here like the fence or the session 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.320
 what is this we put it down here and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490
 Now the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 where dragon city says and we squeeze 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.080
 and we will look like our data that 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.240
 As you can see, they are the same as I have 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.890
 here in the game and for these dragons 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.990
 we have to tighten I said I 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.150
 dragon for 25 gems we go down to the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.980
 part of up to down so that 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.230
 can see the dragons that still do not come out 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.510
 that I think they are up to 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.260
 down 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.560
 they will be able to how they came out they seem to me 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.560
 we keep going down 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.070
 and in this case I'm going to show you the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.260
 dragon rockfield I think that's what it's called 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.680
 I 'm not sure 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.260
 but here I am not looking 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.560
 it's already here I think here is it 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.560
 the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.390
 rock and the dragon leader here is 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.640
 as you can see here he says he thinks his 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.620
 costs 25 gems all dragons 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.620
 They cost 25 gems and we give here to bai 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.610
 and we hope already here that it has been loaded 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.050
 they removed gems as they could see 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.860
 we go here to our dragon city 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.729
 we recharge our dragon city 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.069
 here they are watching 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.650
 those dragons I think more after 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.080
 they are going to leave on an island but then I 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.220
 here if I bring you for 25 gems so that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 have us before everyone and then pass 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.220
 the video so that others can see it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 people 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.470
 here we are closing this poster of 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.510
 monster lines also of the offer that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.260
 also the same can be achieved by 25 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.019
 gems just have to search 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.720
 we go here we are in to build us 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.500
 we go to the store we change page 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.390
 here is dragon rocks filder we give it 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.849
 to use or sell but in this case I do not 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.410
 because I will do it with a market that burns 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.660
 the direct dragon there will be life 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.170
 and here as you can see I already moved 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.260
 the dragon that here I have given his name 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.750
 rock bones and I will put you are watching it 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 covered is not dark and metal 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.170
 only one hat is put on a hat 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
 we feed until it reaches level 4 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.970
 so that his next 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.680
 animation in this case I put it to 5 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.990
 what are we seeing to take the coin 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.600
 and also upload the hack so that 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.770
 can see that they are so they can 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.440
 make it as I move 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.350
 directly dragon a habitat without 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.930
 wait for the time to invent here as 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.350
 can see you already reached level 25 in your 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.350
 last stage 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.239
 and you can see them let's see their last 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.849
 stage only with what is thrown back 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.629
 hiding from something says it's a 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.629
 tycoon according to something like this we close this 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.050
 and we go to our 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 training 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.240
 so they can see the attacks of this 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.240
 dragon 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.130
 here you can see it have the grim reaper 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.380
 cannonballs 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.450
 black hole 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.800
 and ninja stars that those are the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.100
 attacks that are for training 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.710
 now we go here to the world of fighting 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.280
 that is now pretty pretty league 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.750
 small good very very beginners it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.350
 You can mean level 6 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.910
 and then it's going to be quite easy channel 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.840
 We send a life to the museum that takes 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.840
 is monsters lines 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.660
 as you can see it was already defeated very 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:43.790
 easily pull out your coral dragon 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.790
 and we sent him a blunt blow 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.889
 here you are seeing 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.889
 was treated with this dragon win are 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.030
 the battles we go here we 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.130
 fighting rather we demand an oxide 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.520
 and this is already defeated this 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.050
 hot metal dragon 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.050
 we press him to finish 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.710
 they closed this and then this has been all 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.470
 guys, I hope you liked it and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.240
 served a lot so that they can 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.310
 get much cheaper dragons already 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.930
 that dragon sites very expensive but already 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.360
 they know everything is that to their responsibility 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.760
 If they want to do it for a century, they do not know 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.040
