00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 could 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.410
 7th had a great evening 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 tomorrow monday it will be a start of the week 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.520
 with one of the hottest days 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.800
 of the week by the way weather france 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.960
 asks us to be vigilant enough because 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.160
 it will go from 32 to 36 degrees on the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.140
 most parts of France with a 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.609
 sun look radiant on 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.960
 many regions with the exception of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.939
 some small mists on the side of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 cotentin or lavender and some 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.730
 clouds a little bit thicker on the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 pointe finistère or the Basque coast 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.089
 and landaise some small mist 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 also on the hérault and then in 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.279
 the afternoon 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.810
 this should turn a little bit to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 thunderstorm the heat storms that 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.680
 will explode on the relief with some 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.030
 overflows pleads as usual 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.789
 were the heat storms can 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 to be strong locally so and for man 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.690
 group and squalls so be careful 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.089
 but the only ones will undermine it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 a few pages will progress to work 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.109
 and then times during the morning 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.350
 they will have a hard time lowering the 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:58.050
 night she rose to watch 16 to 24 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.429
 barely degrees the open flaps he 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.960
 will already have to be very chauvinistic to do in the 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.940
 capital and in the afternoon look 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 it's temperatures that will progress 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.440
 I told you Monday will be the day 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.080
 the hottest with values ​​of 30 31 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.160
 at 36 degrees under shelter on the coasts of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.360
 the sleeve would be a little bit 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.790
 more breathable and it will be very hot 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 anyway then for the cities 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.750
 well look at Tuesday degradation 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.340
 stormy from the west with locally 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 so strong thunderstorms locally 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 also some thunderstorms on the relief 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 31 32 degrees from north to south 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 Wednesday a little cloud advance on 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.370
 Pointe Finistère 28 32 degrees North 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.900
 to the south some residues again 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.640
 slightly stormy on the relief 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.800
 then I say is there a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 disturbance then really low 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.670
 activity will be rejected on the islands 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.290
 British and we will have some clouds 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 a little more abundance on the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.010
 northwest 28 to 32 degrees okay 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.110
 start to drop a little bit it will do 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.970
 very beautiful I say it will degrade a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.860
 little friday with again an activity 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.830
 stormy over the northwest of the country 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.720
 27 to 31 degrees we see that with this 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.610
 stormy trend the temperatures are going 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.160
 to become a little more bearable 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.490
