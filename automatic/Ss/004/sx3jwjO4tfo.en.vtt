00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.230
 at this stage the internet and mobile 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.180
 networks this driver went the most 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.760
 tech gadget then what you can 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.320
 to find a new design and the same youtube 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.519
 The main thing in the tunnel technology and gadgets 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 for the week they were soldering 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.330
 the prophecy came true on tuesday night 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.609
 Aytyuns still started in Russia by the way 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.800
 in Ukraine you can buy music and movies 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.410
 worth the content is two times cheaper than 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240
 West song for 15 19 rubles and the movie 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.550
 two hundred three hundred torn last by the way 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.410
 strangely incomprehensible timur watching a movie 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.870
 on ipad should cost the same 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 how many movie tickets 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.719
 No answer while Russian base 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 musicians unless of course someone 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 interesting enough meager it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.010
 flagships are our favorite artists 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.430
 Christmas tree Grigoriy Leps Sergei Lazarev &amp; Roma 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.560
 acorn 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.810
 In general, agree and managed to far 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.010
 not with all russian 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.710
 copyright holders and find in itunes 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.239
 nothing at all is impossible 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.220
 less one advantage over such 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.730
 industry monsters like VKontakte and 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.920
 torrents 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 there is also the convenience of receiving 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.629
 content found a song of pairs of clicks and 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.950
 She bought you already in the smartphone is there enough 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.840
 this in order to lure 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.610
 users from the dark side of the pirate 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 music I doubt very much 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.110
 no, I doubt not enough but all 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 anyway you have one important 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.119
 the apple finally recognized 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.190
 Russia is not a third world country above 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 either of course not yet hit but all 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.729
 equally nice 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.860
 by the way more to apple news 14 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.930
 December, Russia will begin to sell the fifth 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 iphone and officially they will cost on 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.940
 5 10 percent more expensive than predecessor 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.530
 that is, from 30 to 40 thousand rubles example 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.030
 and it is not putting it mildly in especially 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.950
 compared to other flagships on 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.570
 the market but such pricing is understandable 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.460
 First you need to sell off the old iphone 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.080
 and which lie plentifully in warehouses 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.250
 surely and secondly well at all 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.600
 ever confused iphone up to 40 by the closet 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.160
 in fact last week all as 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.260
 as if they had agreed to imagine something 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.720
 in our country so here's your google 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.690
 all launched in Russia mother service 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.520
 but latch count or 7 knowledge thank you 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.810
 localizers are essentially such 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000
 cool cards tips 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.880
 dedicated to any concept which 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.890
 is entered to the right of the search you have it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.360
 to the right here to the right of the search results 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.370
 this is mainly a brief reference from 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.720
 wikipedia but where else plus a little 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.040
 additional information which 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.140
 well structured well that is 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.940
 if we are looking for any director then 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 us his face is a list of his films so 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.330
 now to find out that guy's name 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.190
 from the big bang theories or what is 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.660
 ghana babel can be done on one click 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.670
 less and it also means google 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.530
 became a little smarter a little bit better 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.510
 know the world and the universe in general 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.700
 which undoubtedly brings us closer to heavenly 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.040
 life on earth or uprising machines is 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.090
 how the chip will fall but the graph skis thing 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.950
 comfortable anyway 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
 so far google and other manufacturers 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.099
 working on augmented glasses 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.800
 reality Belgian scientists 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.150
 have developed liquid crystal lenses in 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.099
 the beginning of the invention plan 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.780
 use as a replacement for sunglasses 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.489
 lenses can change tonality in 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.349
 depending on the brightness of the light in 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.000
 they are planned to be further developed in order to 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.099
 they were able to display more complex 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.720
 graphic images at the moment 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.700
 managed to draw a dollar sign 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.620
 image is far from commercial 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.450
 implementations but analysts predict that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.400
 in a few years we will be able to completely 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.569
 drop monitors and replace them 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.849
 lenses agency ministry of defense 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.430
 us darpa introduced the flying robot 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.230
 debate with a hefty claw for now 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.910
 the device looks very clumsy 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.349
 awkward thing but the main thing is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.390
 able to fly and perform the simplest 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.099
 actions with your mechanical arm 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.079
 maximum load weight that robot 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.730
 can lift is 500 grams 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.129
 also where can bet work 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.599
 autonomously positions on gps about for 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.220
 what was created for the device not 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 it says but anyway it's cool 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.090
 flying autonomous robot and even with 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.440
 hand so this is a rebellion of cars near 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.970
 little stickers for finding things for me 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.310
 It seems such things mankind has 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.709
 ten years dreamed of so they appeared 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.030
 sales is called novelty stick infanta 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.579
 is a round black 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.650
 stickers the size of a 25-cent mind no 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.420
 Inside is a bluetooth module 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.970
 led and charge battery which 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.040
 enough for a year stickers work in tandem with 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.810
 application for android or iphone with 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.579
 smartphone you can send a command for 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.660
 to make the sticker blink or learn 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.639
 distance to it 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.069
 direction unfortunately not indicated 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.930
 range is 30 meters 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.120
 in their video creators showed a bunch 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.039
 stick stick scripts they 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.770
 sculpted their remote for tv to 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.700
 luggage at the airport and even to the child well 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.700
 not to get lost 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.650
 Well, at the end of the list is Latvian 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.419
 valdemar to dumss he hoisted the birds on 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.700
 twitter and it turned out to be quite 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.650
 not difficult he stuck the keyboard of some kind 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.900
 food and birds began to print with might and main 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.000
 incoherent messages with their beaks with 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.919
 a frequency of about one hundred fifty three then 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.139
 day and what's the most interesting account 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.210
 angry birds have already subscribed for more 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.130
 eight thousand people apparently not alone 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.760
 Latvians wondering about what the fuck 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.760
 feathered friends

 lg and samsung toshiba phipps panasonic more 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.699
 other companies were fined for 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.659
 collusion on prices 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.879
 cathode ray tubes 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.250
 cathode ray tubes and someone else 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.319
 buys gta wai city come out for android 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.969

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.949
 snapseed editor 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.539
 by the way free tim cook promised that 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.400
 apple will revolutionize 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.280
