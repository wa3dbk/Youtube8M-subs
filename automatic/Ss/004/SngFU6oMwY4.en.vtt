the<00:02:01.540> trick<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.960> to<00:02:01.990> remember<00:02:02.320> that<00:02:02.530> all<00:02:02.830> of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
the trick is to remember that all of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.950 
the trick is to remember that all of
your<00:02:03.130> lines<00:02:03.340> will<00:02:03.580> be<00:02:03.610> printed<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.240> reverse<00:02:04.570> so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
your lines will be printed in reverse so

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.430 
your lines will be printed in reverse so
you'll<00:02:05.710> need<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.040> think<00:02:06.310> opposite<00:02:06.850> any<00:02:07.840> areas

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
you'll need to think opposite any areas

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.290 
you'll need to think opposite any areas
you<00:02:08.619> don't<00:02:08.770> carve<00:02:09.190> are<00:02:09.520> called<00:02:09.789> positive

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
you don't carve are called positive

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.650 
you don't carve are called positive
space<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.899> those<00:02:11.530> will<00:02:11.739> show<00:02:11.770> up<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.220> ink

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
space and those will show up in ink

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.330 
space and those will show up in ink
any<00:02:13.660> lines<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.260> carve<00:02:14.590> are<00:02:14.890> called

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
any lines you do carve are called

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.130 
any lines you do carve are called
negative<00:02:15.730> space<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.209> those<00:02:16.720> will<00:02:16.930> remain

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
negative space and those will remain

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.580 
negative space and those will remain
uneat<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:19.180> may<00:02:19.360> find<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.750> helpful<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.440> label

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
uneat you may find it helpful to label

most important rule in carving a block
is<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.459> always<00:02:42.790> cut<00:02:43.000> away<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.209> yourself

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420
