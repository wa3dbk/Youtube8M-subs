00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 to 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 we practice out of the air that this is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 the room lives swarming and this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.960
 then it gives you the same 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.349
 well you do not care but you do not put 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 nervous yes yes I'm a little nervous yes 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.820
 still a little bit on this occasion 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.820
 we are going to be opening loves 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.699
 for this presentation and this we 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.649
 We are very honored that we were 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.850
 invited to swarm to open them because 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.780
 we are super fans of your music since 2000 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.210
 until now he does not care about the two 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
 farms people because good I'm already 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.300
 old man sees him badly from interviews 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.360
 they did they interviewed me the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.949
 presented and the truth is that I was 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600
 he did not aim to pee me but he impressed me 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.970
 a lot because robert smith and morrissey 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.369
 because it imposes or is to greet morrissey 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.400
 It's a feat you've seen all your life in 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:07.280
 covers and that you know more songs 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.590

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.250
 important thing for you is very is very 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.750
 important and this and we wanted something 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.549
 different because after three lives 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.619
 Latinos like we do not want to repeat 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.560
 somehow we are a bit limited 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.930
 for the time that we have then we 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460
 it fell like a finger to be able to be 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.350
 this the women's opening band and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.509
 because it is already on its own it is something 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.280
 different not then besides we're going 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.719
 is presenting new topics never 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.179
 we interpret at a Latin level of 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.770
 our disco guests of lorbek 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.299
 especially if we are right now 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.859
 you realize that you can put it like this 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.600
 when when you sign your resume 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:48.119
 You can say that Morrissey telonero 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.119
 it's already with that I have enough 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.219
 how they prepare or how they do how much 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 time to last 7 can know look 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.420
 I'm not sure yet when I say 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.259
 that we do not think it's going to be 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.390
 longer than one hour 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.000
