00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.390
 hello hello we are at fractal 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.650
 design one is always 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.980
 in taipei we will introduce two 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.140
 new features body 500 and nod 220 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.860
 so we start with the horn 505 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.110
 gauthier micro-atx who will be mutated x 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 pardon that will be offered at 69 euros 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.410
 with us the idea is to have a 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.839
 bottier that allow to put a 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.640
 280mm watercooling radiator in 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.739
 the top at the front we find the design 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.300
 fractal design that we know with the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.400
 plastic that melt aluminum 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.720
 there is a 5.25-inch bay on the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.820
 we're going to have power and laurie 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.239
 are the audio inputs 2 ports 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.070
 usb 3.0 on the side we have a grid that 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.129
 will allow the breakdown of the map 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.600
 graph and if we go to the back we 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.310
 will have two slots of extensions for 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.160
 a graphics card a fan of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.420
 140 mm backwards compatible with 120 mm 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.789
 the location of the plate that in chile 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.200
 and the enough in to be able to give back the 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.179
 current to the food is going on 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.860
 which is placed at the front 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.820
 the opening is like those it's 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.820
 very simple like ku 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.760
 inside we notice the presence of 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.120
 magnetic filters 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.120
 finally 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.549
 inside so big place for the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 graphic card filter loving and in 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.180
 the bottom 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.790
 the food is up front as 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.729
 these here we have a 3.5 inch bay 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.570
 for a hdd a 5.25-inch bay and 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 this cage and of course removable 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.880
 here the expansion slot the fan 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.590
 back in 140 mm if we turn from 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.150
 the other side we find a platinum to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.920
 turntables that will ride two 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.340
 3.5 inch ssd hard drives in 2.5 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.990
 inch 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990
 finally last feature 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 we find at the front another 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.680
 2.5 inch slot 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 at 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.850
 only size and type 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.380
 we now go to nahd 220 so 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.360
 it's a nice challenge to impose or 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.310
 vertically or 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 horizontally as you want so 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.180
 the idea is 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 notes 202 forgiveness our game 200 this 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.300
 so we're thinking about asking or asking 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.710
 vertically or horizontally care 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 to make for example a console of 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.910
 living room or a htpc 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.410
 we are on a plastic manufacturing a 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940
 little shiny on the top it's 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.740
 very well done we have the entrances 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.040
 audio the usb 3.0 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.140
 the power 'it opens very easily 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.880
 like these and we see these filters and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 inside at the level of the CPU cooler 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.739
 at the back we will find slot for 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.569
 a graphics card here a location 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.310
 in order to install a riser that will 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.560
 sold as an option and we can put a 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 large double slot card of big 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
 format or so why not an as you to 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.860
 the interior that will come to move towards 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.989
 the front and if the location of the plate 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.430
 motherboard figures the location 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.230
 of the motherboard here is the location 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.290
 of the diet then there will be two 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.980
 versions a version at 89 euros without 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.880
 power supply and a version at 129 or 119 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.910
 euros we do not know anymore with a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.980
 450 watt sfx power supply in 80 plus 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.690
 bronze with modular cables 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.640
 we do not forget to tell you that 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.350
 sure as it is a beautiful 10 the silent 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.069
 we find filters and 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.590
 locations everywhere under the food 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.359
 we find a removable filter and we 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.780
 also finds a filter at this level 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.550
 there under the two locations in 120 mm 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.959
 we were at computex we were at home 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.110
 fractal design and we tell you to very 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.110
 soon
