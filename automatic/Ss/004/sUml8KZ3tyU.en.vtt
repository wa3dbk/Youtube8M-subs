polymer chemistry and colloid chemistry
the<00:00:32.279> area<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.759> called<00:00:33.000> polymer<00:00:33.329> colloids

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the area is then called polymer colloids

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.560 
the area is then called polymer colloids
and<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.850> work<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> an

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and what we do is that we work in an

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
and what we do is that we work in an
area<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.079> call<00:00:37.290> super<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> colloidal

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
area which we call super a colloidal

them like Lego blocks it's a combination

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.600 
them like Lego blocks it's a combination
of<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:45.930> things<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.620> thing<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.489> we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of two things and one thing is that we

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.369 
of two things and one thing is that we
play<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.879> emulsions<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.809> emulsion<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
play with emulsions and an emulsion is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
play with emulsions and an emulsion is
something<00:00:50.219> similar<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.030> Bailey's<00:00:51.480> or

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
something similar to like Bailey's or

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
something similar to like Bailey's or
mayonnaise<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.710> means<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.640> face<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
mayonnaise it means that one face that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
mayonnaise it means that one face that
doesn't<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.719> an<00:00:54.870> other<00:00:54.989> face<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> dispersed

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
doesn't like an other face is dispersed

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.720 
doesn't like an other face is dispersed
for<00:00:56.879> instance<00:00:57.210> oil<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.410> water<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.890> mix<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
for instance oil and water don't mix and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
for instance oil and water don't mix and
if<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.969> mix<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.350> quickly<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.980> get

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
if you mix them really quickly you get

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.680 
if you mix them really quickly you get
very<00:01:02.340> small<00:01:02.430> droplets<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> order

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
very small droplets of one in the order

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
very small droplets of one in the order
that's<00:01:04.170> called<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.530> emulsion<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.549> use

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that's called an emulsion and we use

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.200 
that's called an emulsion and we use
emulsions<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.900> template<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.799> assemble<00:01:08.760> tiny

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
emulsions as a template to assemble tiny

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
emulsions as a template to assemble tiny
little<00:01:09.420> particles<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.619> when<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
little particles around it and when you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.740 
little particles around it and when you
do<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.360> effect<00:01:12.689> called

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
do that that's an effect called

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
do that that's an effect called
Pickering<00:01:13.409> emulsion<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
Pickering emulsion which is which is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
Pickering emulsion which is which is
more<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> hundred<00:01:15.060> years<00:01:15.450> old<00:01:15.540> actually

the<00:01:16.110> first<00:01:16.320> person<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.009> described<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> 1903

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the first person I described is in 1903

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.990 
the first person I described is in 1903
which<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.049> ramsden<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.770> nobody<00:01:20.700> really

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
which was ramsden and nobody really

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
which was ramsden and nobody really
knows<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> stuff<00:01:21.509> paper<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> 1907<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
knows the stuff paper and then in 1907 a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
knows the stuff paper and then in 1907 a
guy<00:01:23.220> called<00:01:23.490> Pickering<00:01:23.939> wrote<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.750> nice

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
guy called Pickering wrote a really nice

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.090 
guy called Pickering wrote a really nice
paper<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:25.890> why<00:01:26.040> these

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
paper on it and that's why these

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
paper on it and that's why these
emotions<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.060> stabilized<00:01:27.600> with

emotions that are stabilized with

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
emotions that are stabilized with
particles<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.680> called<00:01:28.920> Pickering<00:01:29.310> emulsion

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
particles are called Pickering emulsion

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
particles are called Pickering emulsion
we<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.210> make<00:01:30.390> hollow<00:01:30.659> structures<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.259> if

we can make hollow structures with if

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.249 
we can make hollow structures with if
they're<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:31.979> yeah<00:01:32.400> okay<00:01:33.259> Patrick

I'm the guy that tries it out first we

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
I'm the guy that tries it out first we
would<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> work<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.320> scale<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
would like to work on a scale that is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
would like to work on a scale that is
very<00:01:53.310> small<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> nano<00:01:54.540> scale

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
very small which is like a nano scale

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
very small which is like a nano scale
and<00:01:55.200> why<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> assemble<00:01:56.460> very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and why do you want to assemble very

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.209 
and why do you want to assemble very
tiny<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.659> Lego<00:01:57.930> blocks<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.950> really

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
tiny little Lego blocks and not really

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.649 
tiny little Lego blocks and not really
big<00:01:59.399> ones<00:01:59.610> well<00:01:59.790> big<00:02:00.000> ones<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
big ones well big ones you know if you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
big ones well big ones you know if you
go<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.439> shop<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:01.979> just<00:02:02.219> hand

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
go to the shop and you can just hand

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.999 
go to the shop and you can just hand
assemble<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> work<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> scale

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
assemble them we want to work on a scale

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
assemble them we want to work on a scale
it's<00:02:05.159> way<00:02:05.280> smaller<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.149> instance<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
it's way smaller so for instance if you

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.440 
it's way smaller so for instance if you
take<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> 5p<00:02:07.320> coin<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.640> put<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> site<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
take a 5p coin and you put on a site and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.750 
take a 5p coin and you put on a site and
you<00:02:09.509> would<00:02:09.629> slice<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> into<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> million<00:02:10.530> pieces

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
you would slice it into a million pieces

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.920 
you would slice it into a million pieces
that's<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> kind<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.090> scale<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.510> work<00:02:12.690> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that's the kind of scale we work on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.190 
that's the kind of scale we work on
which

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
which

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
which
the<00:02:13.319> nanometer<00:02:13.770> scale<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.790> we<00:02:15.000> need

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the nanometer scale and for that we need

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.479 
the nanometer scale and for that we need
very<00:02:15.330> very<00:02:15.660> small<00:02:15.959> droplets<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.709> therefore

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
very very small droplets and therefore

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.850 
very very small droplets and therefore
we<00:02:17.610> need<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.760> lot<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> energy<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.650> why

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
we need a lot of energy and that's why

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.589 
we need a lot of energy and that's why
we<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.160> ultrasound<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.880> ultrasound<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
we use ultrasound so ultrasound is

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.680 
we use ultrasound so ultrasound is
capable<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.310> dispersing<00:02:23.310> oil<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:24.000> water<00:02:24.270> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
capable of dispersing oil in water and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.990 
capable of dispersing oil in water and
making<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.290> droplets<00:02:25.709> really<00:02:26.040> small<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.520> 50

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
making the droplets really small like 50

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
making the droplets really small like 50
nanometer<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> hundred<00:02:28.230> nanometer<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
nanometer to a hundred nanometer and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
nanometer to a hundred nanometer and
that's<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> scale<00:02:29.640> we're<00:02:29.819> working<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:33.209> then

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
that's the scale we're working and then

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
that's the scale we're working and then
the<00:02:33.450> particles<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.200> use<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.620> even

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the particles that we use are even

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.890 
the particles that we use are even
smaller<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.670> use<00:02:35.819> clay<00:02:36.150> particles<00:02:36.720> for

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
smaller so we use clay particles for

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.710 
smaller so we use clay particles for
instance<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.920> are<00:02:38.040> 25<00:02:38.640> nano<00:02:38.940> meters<00:02:39.269> by<00:02:39.480> one

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
instance there are 25 nano meters by one

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.360 
instance there are 25 nano meters by one
which<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> hockey<00:02:40.590> puck<00:02:40.830> disc<00:02:41.130> and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
which is like a hockey puck disc and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.910 
which is like a hockey puck disc and
they<00:02:41.760> assemble<00:02:42.239> really<00:02:42.510> nicely<00:02:42.739> around<00:02:43.739> this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
they assemble really nicely around this

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.280 
they assemble really nicely around this
tiny<00:02:44.459> little<00:02:44.700> droplets<00:02:45.000> which<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> hundred

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
tiny little droplets which is a hundred

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
tiny little droplets which is a hundred
nanometer<00:02:46.680> 200<00:02:47.190> nanometer<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
nanometer 200 nanometer and that's the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.150 
nanometer 200 nanometer and that's the
area<00:02:48.750> are<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.900> working<00:02:49.260> these<00:02:49.680> non<00:02:50.040> spherical

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
area are we working these non spherical

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.370 
area are we working these non spherical
particles<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.060> Stefan<00:02:51.480> makes<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.989> mean<00:02:52.140> no

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.259 
particles that Stefan makes I mean no
one<00:02:52.560> ever<00:02:52.709> thought<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.280> making<00:02:53.790> these<00:02:53.910> things

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
one ever thought of making these things

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.210 
one ever thought of making these things
the<00:02:54.569> way<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.930> Stefan<00:02:55.350> has<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.799> he<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.069> went

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
the way that Stefan has and he just went

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
the way that Stefan has and he just went
art<00:02:56.430> it'll<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> fun<00:02:57.090> idea

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
art it'll be a fun idea

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.509 
art it'll be a fun idea
just<00:02:58.019> try<00:02:58.319> making<00:02:58.650> some<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.920> these<00:02:59.010> pickering

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
just try making some of these pickering

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.710 
just try making some of these pickering
emulsions<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.030> pass<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.330> through<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.480> tube

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
emulsions and pass them through a tube

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
emulsions and pass them through a tube
over<00:03:01.110> over<00:03:01.260> again<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.830> see<00:03:02.010> what<00:03:02.250> happens

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
over over again and to see what happens

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.880 
over over again and to see what happens
and<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.269> made<00:03:03.480> nice<00:03:03.780> non<00:03:04.049> spherical<00:03:04.140> particles

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and it made nice non spherical particles

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.699 
and it made nice non spherical particles
in<00:03:05.069> there<00:03:05.370> also<00:03:06.030> these<00:03:06.750> structures<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.590> are

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
in there also these structures that are

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.490 
in there also these structures that are
called<00:03:07.920> types<00:03:08.690> which<00:03:09.690> are<00:03:09.840> high<00:03:10.019> internal

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
other ones when we used clay to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.300 
other ones when we used clay to
stabilize<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:30.000> mini<00:03:30.959> emotions<00:03:31.410> he<00:03:31.950> said<00:03:32.130> well

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
stabilize the mini emotions he said well

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
stabilize the mini emotions he said well
what<00:03:32.459> happens<00:03:32.760> if<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.000> burn<00:03:33.209> all<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.450> polymer

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
what happens if you burn all the polymer

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.810 
what happens if you burn all the polymer
off<00:03:33.900> just<00:03:34.200> see<00:03:34.590> what<00:03:34.709> happens<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.040> we<00:03:35.280> put<00:03:35.760> it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
off just see what happens so we put it

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.160 
off just see what happens so we put it
in<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:35.970> oven<00:03:36.090> at<00:03:36.269> 600<00:03:36.750> degrees<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.109> you

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
in the oven at 600 degrees and you

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.660 
in the oven at 600 degrees and you
actually<00:03:37.260> get<00:03:37.470> like<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> ceramic<00:03:38.310> Network

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
actually get like a ceramic Network

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.160 
actually get like a ceramic Network
formed<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:39.959> different

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
formed it's all just different

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.020 
formed it's all just different
structures<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.950> he<00:03:41.040> forms<00:03:41.430> by<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
structures that he forms by just

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.910 
structures that he forms by just
thinking<00:03:42.180> what<00:03:42.660> we<00:03:42.780> try<00:03:43.019> if<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.230> do<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.530> but

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
thinking what we try if you do this but

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.229 
thinking what we try if you do this but
the<00:03:44.040> moment<00:03:44.370> we<00:03:44.400> do<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.609> collaborative

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
the moment we do a collaborative

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.819 
the moment we do a collaborative
research<00:03:45.600> with<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:46.019> number<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.380> industries

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
research with a number of industries

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.550 
research with a number of industries
really<00:03:47.160> because<00:03:47.370> they<00:03:48.359> felt<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.380> can

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
really because they felt like if you can

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.039 
really because they felt like if you can
combine<00:03:49.829> very<00:03:50.790> small<00:03:51.120> particles<00:03:51.660> or<00:03:51.810> more

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
combine very small particles or more

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.270 
combine very small particles or more
complex<00:03:52.440> structures<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:52.980> could<00:03:53.130> have<00:03:53.250> a

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
complex structures it could have a

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.390 
complex structures it could have a
number<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.850> benefits<00:03:54.420> for<00:03:54.900> instance<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.920> we're

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
number of benefits for instance so we're

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.190 
number of benefits for instance so we're
working<00:03:56.640> with<00:03:56.790> some<00:03:57.180> coatings<00:03:57.600> industries<00:03:58.049> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
working with some coatings industries in

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.039 
working with some coatings industries in
order<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.400> make<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:00.120> hybrid<00:04:00.569> material

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
order to to to make a hybrid material

- that's that's the type of material now

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.640 
- that's that's the type of material now
if<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.479> combine<00:04:21.810> those<00:04:21.989> two<00:04:22.049> things<00:04:22.260> together

if you combine those two things together
you<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:24.360> instance<00:04:24.630> can<00:04:24.720> make<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> scratch

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
you for instance can make a scratch

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.720 
you for instance can make a scratch
resistant<00:04:25.830> coating

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
which is beneficial you know if people

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.960 
which is beneficial you know if people
have<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.260> car<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.620> someone<00:04:28.950> comes<00:04:29.430> across<00:04:29.580> with

a with a with a key and you know you
don't<00:04:32.580> really<00:04:32.790> want<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.540> show<00:04:33.690> up<00:04:34.080> and

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
don't really want that to show up and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.890 
don't really want that to show up and
that's<00:04:35.010> that's<00:04:35.430> an<00:04:35.550> advanced<00:04:36.060> application<00:04:36.750> of

area of bickering emotions like I said

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.260 
area of bickering emotions like I said
is<00:04:43.440> really<00:04:43.620> old<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.250> not<00:04:44.370> until<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:44.970> we

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
is really old but not until now that we

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.420 
is really old but not until now that we
have<00:04:45.480> the<00:04:45.800> capabilities<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.830> actually

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
have the capabilities of actually

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.310 
have the capabilities of actually
characterizing<00:04:48.240> these<00:04:48.360> structures<00:04:48.840> which

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
characterizing these structures which

for instance advanced microscopes
electron<00:04:51.720> microscopes<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.890> can

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
electron microscopes that we really can

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.710 
electron microscopes that we really can
zoom<00:04:53.250> into<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.610> nano<00:04:53.820> scale<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.570> we<00:04:54.690> can

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
zoom into the nano scale and we can

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.990 
zoom into the nano scale and we can
actually<00:04:55.080> understand<00:04:55.800> these<00:04:55.950> materials<00:04:56.520> we

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
actually understand these materials we

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.880 
actually understand these materials we
can<00:04:57.180> make<00:04:57.420> commercially<00:04:58.290> interested

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
can make commercially interested

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.160 
can make commercially interested
products<00:04:59.790> out<00:04:59.910> of<00:04:59.940> this<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.510> we<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.720> really

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
products out of this and we can really

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.570 
products out of this and we can really
guide<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.620> properties<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.100> we<00:05:02.250> want<00:05:02.520> to

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
guide the properties that we want to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.560 
guide the properties that we want to
have<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:05.370> areas<00:05:05.700> we<00:05:05.940> are<00:05:05.970> looking<00:05:06.360> into

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
have so the areas we are looking into

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.960 
have so the areas we are looking into
for<00:05:07.050> instance<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.470> coatings<00:05:07.950> we're<00:05:08.670> looking

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
for instance is coatings we're looking

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.600 
for instance is coatings we're looking
at<00:05:09.120> self-healing<00:05:10.070> composites<00:05:11.070> together<00:05:11.430> with

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
kind of say well where do we go from

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.400 
kind of say well where do we go from
here<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:29.880> Stefan<00:05:30.690> says<00:05:30.810> we'll<00:05:30.990> give<00:05:31.020> me<00:05:31.350> a

here and Stefan says we'll give me a

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.900 
here and Stefan says we'll give me a
couple<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.710> days<00:05:31.860> I'll<00:05:32.190> think<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.550> something

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
couple of days I'll think of something

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.850 
couple of days I'll think of something
up<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.270> then<00:05:33.390> he'll<00:05:33.480> come<00:05:33.720> in<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:33.900> say<00:05:34.050> I've

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
up and then he'll come in and say I've

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.650 
up and then he'll come in and say I've
got<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.070> good<00:05:35.250> idea<00:05:35.400> one<00:05:35.790> we<00:05:35.970> tried<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.390> and

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
got a good idea one we tried this and

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.060 
got a good idea one we tried this and
move<00:05:36.810> on<00:05:36.960> so<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.290> really<00:05:37.650> don't<00:05:37.830> know<00:05:37.950> where

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
move on so I really don't know where

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.560 
move on so I really don't know where
it's<00:05:38.160> going<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.310> end<00:05:38.370> up<00:05:38.610> at<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.880> end<00:05:38.910> it's<00:05:39.360> all

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
it's going to end up at the end it's all

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.020 
it's going to end up at the end it's all
depends<00:05:40.020> on<00:05:40.110> where<00:05:40.380> where<00:05:41.010> Stefan<00:05:41.460> decides

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
depends on where where Stefan decides

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.060 
depends on where where Stefan decides
that<00:05:42.360> he<00:05:42.930> would<00:05:43.140> like<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.410> take<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.770> it's

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
that he would like to take it it's

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.500 
that he would like to take it it's
pretty<00:05:44.340> amazing<00:05:44.790> what<00:05:44.880> we<00:05:45.030> can<00:05:45.060> do<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.390> we

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
pretty amazing what we can do and we

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.410 
pretty amazing what we can do and we
learn<00:05:45.660> more<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.020> more<00:05:46.170> every<00:05:46.320> day<00:05:46.740> like<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.820> few

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
learn more and more every day like a few

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.850 
learn more and more every day like a few
weeks<00:05:48.570> ago<00:05:48.840> someone<00:05:49.320> from<00:05:49.470> Delft<00:05:49.800> University

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
weeks ago someone from Delft University

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.770 
weeks ago someone from Delft University
came<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.610> us<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:50.850> said<00:05:50.910> well<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:51.240> know<00:05:51.360> it

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
came to us and said well you know it

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.300 
came to us and said well you know it
would<00:05:51.900> be<00:05:52.050> really<00:05:52.230> cool<00:05:52.530> if<00:05:52.770> droplets

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
would be really cool if droplets

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.360 
would be really cool if droplets
wouldn't<00:05:53.580> be<00:05:53.670> sphere<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:55.260> we<00:05:55.350> were<00:05:55.470> like<00:05:55.590> can

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
wouldn't be sphere and we were like can

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.980 
wouldn't be sphere and we were like can
we<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.790> and<00:05:57.000> we<00:05:57.120> fiddled<00:05:57.660> around<00:05:57.720> a

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
we do that and we fiddled around a

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.090 
we do that and we fiddled around a
little<00:05:58.080> bit<00:05:58.230> in<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.440> slab<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:58.860> we<00:05:58.920> can

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
little bit in the slab and now we can

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.500 
little bit in the slab and now we can
make<00:05:59.220> droplets<00:05:59.580> that<00:05:59.640> look<00:05:59.850> like<00:05:59.970> cucumbers

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
make droplets that look like cucumbers

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.380 
make droplets that look like cucumbers
for<00:06:01.140> instance<00:06:01.500> which<00:06:01.890> is<00:06:01.920> fantastic<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.760> if

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
for instance which is fantastic and if

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.930 
for instance which is fantastic and if
you<00:06:03.570> don't<00:06:03.780> think<00:06:04.080> way<00:06:04.650> away<00:06:04.920> a<00:06:04.950> heads<00:06:05.310> then

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
you don't think way away a heads then

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.850 
you don't think way away a heads then
for<00:06:06.180> applications<00:06:06.780> cucumber<00:06:07.650> shaped

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
for applications cucumber shaped

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.120 
for applications cucumber shaped
droplets<00:06:08.310> would<00:06:08.640> do<00:06:08.760> brilliance<00:06:09.300> in<00:06:09.510> in<00:06:10.440> in

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
droplets would do brilliance in in in

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.920 
droplets would do brilliance in in in
self-healing<00:06:11.670> composites<00:06:12.390> for<00:06:12.540> instance<00:06:12.810> in

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
self-healing composites for instance in

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.430 
self-healing composites for instance in
airplane<00:06:13.350> wings<00:06:14.060> so<00:06:15.060> that's<00:06:15.870> that's<00:06:16.110> why<00:06:16.290> they

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
airplane wings so that's that's why they

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.020 
airplane wings so that's that's why they
approached<00:06:16.740> us<00:06:16.770> with<00:06:17.130> that<00:06:17.220> they<00:06:17.370> were<00:06:17.700> in<00:06:17.850> an

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
approached us with that they were in an

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.420 
approached us with that they were in an
aerodynamics<00:06:18.810> group<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:19.890> their<00:06:20.010> approaches

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
aerodynamics group and their approaches

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.420 
aerodynamics group and their approaches
with<00:06:21.000> that<00:06:21.120> particular<00:06:21.510> case<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:21.960> yeah<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:23.010> we

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
with that particular case so yeah and we

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.070 
with that particular case so yeah and we
we<00:06:23.700> were<00:06:23.820> not<00:06:23.970> aware<00:06:24.210> that<00:06:24.270> we<00:06:24.660> could<00:06:24.810> do<00:06:24.930> this

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
we were not aware that we could do this

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.570 
we were not aware that we could do this
on<00:06:25.230> large-scale<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.950> you<00:06:26.130> know<00:06:26.220> we<00:06:26.340> played

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
on large-scale and you know we played

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.430 
on large-scale and you know we played
around<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:27.030> little<00:06:27.120> bit<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.510> as<00:06:27.780> Sully<00:06:28.140> was

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
around a little bit and as Sully was

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.050 
around a little bit and as Sully was
there<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:28.890> I<00:06:29.190> think<00:06:29.250> that's<00:06:29.490> really<00:06:29.670> amazing

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.120
