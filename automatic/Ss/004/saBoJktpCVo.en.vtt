paint stripper the kind that bears
methylene<00:00:10.219> chloride<00:00:11.170> look<00:00:12.170> the<00:00:12.770> cap<00:00:13.070> is

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
methylene chloride look the cap is

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.970 
methylene chloride look the cap is
starting<00:00:13.610> to<00:00:13.730> come<00:00:13.910> off<00:00:14.260> so<00:00:15.260> before<00:00:15.559> I<00:00:15.590> take<00:00:15.830> it

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
starting to come off so before I take it

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.170 
starting to come off so before I take it
the<00:00:16.070> rest<00:00:16.160> away<00:00:16.400> off<00:00:16.550> let<00:00:16.699> me<00:00:16.730> show<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.000> how

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
the rest away off let me show you how

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.890 
the rest away off let me show you how
I'm<00:00:17.300> doing<00:00:17.330> it

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
I'm doing it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.240 
I'm doing it
I<00:00:19.269> found<00:00:20.269> a<00:00:20.420> socket<00:00:20.720> that<00:00:21.050> roughly<00:00:21.560> fits<00:00:21.980> I'm

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
I found a socket that roughly fits I'm

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.769 
I found a socket that roughly fits I'm
marking<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.820> end<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.029> cylinder<00:00:23.509> but<00:00:23.630> it

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
marking the end of the cylinder but it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.460 
marking the end of the cylinder but it
doesn't<00:00:24.050> matter

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
doesn't matter

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.159 
doesn't matter
roughly<00:00:25.160> fits<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:25.759> there<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:26.150> go<00:00:26.330> and<00:00:26.779> now<00:00:26.900> for

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
roughly fits so there we go and now for

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.700 
roughly fits so there we go and now for

bare end John says it'll break and I can
certainly<00:00:50.480> imagine<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:51.170> what<00:00:51.290> happened<00:00:51.760> so

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
certainly imagine that what happened so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.890 
certainly imagine that what happened so
let's<00:00:52.880> go<00:00:53.030> ahead<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:53.300> take<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.630> rest<00:00:53.810> of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
let's go ahead and take it the rest of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.940 
let's go ahead and take it the rest of
the<00:00:53.960> way<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:55.900> confirm<00:00:56.900> some<00:00:57.200> firm<00:00:57.410> taps<00:00:57.740> was

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
the way out confirm some firm taps was

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.480 
the way out confirm some firm taps was
all<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.220> took

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
all it took

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.830 
all it took
let's<00:00:59.120> go<00:00:59.240> ahead<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.420> take<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.630> out<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:02.600> there

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
let's go ahead and take it out and there

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.930 
let's go ahead and take it out and there
there's<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.110> little<00:01:06.380> goober<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.730> see

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
there's the little goober and you see

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.690 
there's the little goober and you see
there's<00:01:08.180> no<00:01:08.360> solder<00:01:08.720> it<00:01:09.680> definitely<00:01:10.280> was<00:01:10.490> just

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
there's no solder it definitely was just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.750 
there's no solder it definitely was just
pressed<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.570> there<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.010> certainly<00:01:13.010> certainly

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
pressed in there and certainly certainly

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.460 
pressed in there and certainly certainly
that's<00:01:13.970> paint<00:01:14.240> stripper<00:01:14.630> certainly<00:01:15.260> it<00:01:15.380> was

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that's paint stripper certainly it was

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.250 
that's paint stripper certainly it was
cemented<00:01:16.090> then<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.210> got<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.930> bearing

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
cemented then you got the the bearing

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.110 
cemented then you got the the bearing
surface<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.740> flange<00:01:19.070> provides<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.670> large

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
surface that flange provides a large

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120 
surface that flange provides a large
gluing<00:01:20.570> surface<00:01:20.810> but<00:01:21.470> because<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:21.920> nots

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
gluing surface but because it's nots

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.330 
gluing surface but because it's nots
wedged<00:01:22.550> in<00:01:22.820> place<00:01:23.770> there's<00:01:24.770> no<00:01:24.890> way<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:25.100> could

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
wedged in place there's no way you could

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.490 
wedged in place there's no way you could
rely<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.150> press<00:01:26.630> fit<00:01:26.840> loan<00:01:27.110> it's<00:01:27.320> not<00:01:27.470> a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
rely on just a press fit loan it's not a

rely on just a press fit loan it's not a
Welch<00:01:27.800> plug<00:01:29.440> okay<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:30.680> want<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.310> what<00:01:31.430> this

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
Welch plug okay I want to see what this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.830 
Welch plug okay I want to see what this
is<00:01:31.640> about<00:01:31.900> so<00:01:32.900> do<00:01:32.960> you

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.530 

I've<00:01:40.619> got<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.860> tiny<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.280> bird<00:01:41.670> here<00:01:41.909> from

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I've got a tiny little bird here from

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.680 
I've got a tiny little bird here from
yesterday's<00:01:44.780> mal<00:01:45.780> advised<00:01:47.360> attempt<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.509> use<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
yesterday's mal advised attempt to use a

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.440 
yesterday's mal advised attempt to use a
drift<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> flat<00:01:49.590> edge<00:01:49.770> drift<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> made<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
drift a flat edge drift so I made a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.990 
drift a flat edge drift so I made a
little<00:01:51.630> burr<00:01:52.200> unfortunately<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.159> piston

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
little burr unfortunately on my piston

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.789 
little burr unfortunately on my piston
rod<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> come<00:01:55.740> off

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.740 

yeah<00:02:07.369> if<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.640> had<00:02:07.759> used<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.119> tubing<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.629> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
yeah if I had used the tubing in the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.059 
yeah if I had used the tubing in the
first<00:02:08.959> place<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:10.120> would<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.209> made<00:02:11.390> no<00:02:11.420> BER<00:02:12.069> but

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
first place I would have made no BER but

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.150 
first place I would have made no BER but
I<00:02:13.099> got<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> burr<00:02:13.670> here<00:02:15.489> ain't<00:02:16.489> much<00:02:18.129> but<00:02:19.129> a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
I got a burr here ain't much but a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.009 
I got a burr here ain't much but a
couple<00:02:19.819> thousands<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.510> inch<00:02:20.599> is<00:02:20.810> all<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
couple thousands of an inch is all it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.500 
couple thousands of an inch is all it
takes<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.849> reduce<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.000> clearance<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.420> it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
takes to reduce the clearance so it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.289 
takes to reduce the clearance so it
can't<00:02:23.720> pass<00:02:23.959> through<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:25.489> gland<00:02:25.760> I
