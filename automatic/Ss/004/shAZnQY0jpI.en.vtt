couple different parts there's a
basically<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> ram<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.719> basically<00:00:49.559> cover<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
basically a ram to basically cover it so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.680 
basically a ram to basically cover it so
when<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.239> cover

when you're it's not in use you cover
that<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> pusher<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that and then you have a pusher and you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.650 
that and then you have a pusher and you
basically<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> RAM<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> pusher<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
basically put the RAM in the pusher to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
basically put the RAM in the pusher to
push<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.079> carrot<00:00:55.379> through<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:57.059> most<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.329> time

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
push the carrot through but most of time

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.819 
push the carrot through but most of time
you<00:00:57.570> don't<00:00:57.629> even<00:00:57.809> need<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.289> let<00:00:58.440> me<00:00:58.530> show

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
