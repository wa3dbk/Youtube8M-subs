 hello to all these bubbles this second td 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.649
 webdocs easter egg offer today 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.480
 for a start let's talk about 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.730
 rabbids indeed if you are 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.099
 wild hogs player you surely have it 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.400
 noticed many moron rabbits are 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 scattered all over the map 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.960
 another reference to another license 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.539
 of ubisoft that if not with the references 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.060
 going north of pogny 20 tunnels 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 disused railways will find a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 electric piratable board that will do 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 view anarchist group case 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
 meaning what references 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 some make the connection with the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.120
 French revolution because he was 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.680
 used at that time and so do the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.110
 closer to the next license 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.530
 of ubisoft assassin's creed a study 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 however the mystery remains 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 another mystery of webdocs is also the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
 given paper card in the dead version 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 dry of the game indeed one remembers 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 registration visit only to the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.190
 ultraviolet light of the state amap 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.649
 safe and sound also had fun with 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 that of webdocs by holding the card face 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 to a light source this one not being 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 not completely opaque then reveals 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 indications of a strange is very white 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.420
 back ground wedge 3 positions or for 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
 to tell yourself that these three points do not tip 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.729
 towards nothing special however the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.770
 main one we see a square or 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.299
 indirectly to a key place at the end 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.400
 of the game without spoiler 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.280
 this building turns out to be a point 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 central site ios coincidence I do not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.049
 believe not on the other hand the other two 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 points totally devoid of interest one 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.470
 is in the ocean 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.590
 the other on a desert island there again the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
 mystery remains whole 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 that's all for this video thank you 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.060
