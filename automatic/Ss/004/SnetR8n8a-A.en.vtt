 developments this four with this that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.050

 from lincoln that what you liked most this 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.390
 soon lincoln portal what 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.080
 main was that it has a zone a 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.790
 exclusive access to the colony this the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 land because many fields are managed 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.150
 surpluses and the main thing since 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 facilities with which the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.510
 cologne are very pleasant for 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.210
 develop activities with 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.310
 sons alejandro the most father is that everything 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.420
 you have it behind your back if you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.250
 so say what else he called the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 attention to my wife too and she gives 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.369
 very quiet since the same 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.110
 operation has its kinder with 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.910
 your school which are surrounded 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 of parks and green areas and that's very 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.270
 satisfactory because it is something integral not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.770
 so that our children give what they are 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360
 at school they can go to the park and 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.280
 return to the house without any problem 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.850
 It was really not me to decide 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.800
 to create by the colony that's what 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.959
 we have already bought a house you 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.600
 process can be slow 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.010
 discouraging how was your suspense from 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.840
 that goes to the sales booth 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.810
 until the day where we have entered 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.260
 your house if not the truth then this was a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.790
 very personalized time this really is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.020
 more what they say to what it is because I 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.940
 I also had nothing said you are going to invest 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.730
 a lot of time you're going to waste a lot of time 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.410
 at work and really well no no 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.620

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.600
 do anything the whole thing is the staff 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.709

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.290
