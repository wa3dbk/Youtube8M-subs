00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 and now we make cocoa 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.020
 pour milk we cook gives a portion of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:30.289
 200 milliliters of that we get 400 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:33.570
 milliliters pour cocoa 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 usually take 1 tea one or two tea 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.790
 spoons of cocoa for 200 milliliters here at 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 we have two portions so what is she putting 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:49.550
 a little more than 200 milliliters one or two 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.550
 teaspoons of sugar 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.080
 save need to be careful if 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.600
 put too much then 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.520
 excessive sweet taste like he doesn't 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.540
 lets really enjoy 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.880
 natural aroma and taste which in 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.260
 process 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:20.790
 warmed up stir it is important that tanks 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.790
 which appear in which dissolved 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.079
 here we are preparing what 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.250
 producer mehmet efendi is different 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.640
 the fact that he has no additives 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.299
 make up 100 percent cocoa powder 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.170
 unfortunately lately 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.280
 cocoa producers add 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.770
 various flavors identical 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 natural or not identical which 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:04.179
 spoil the natural taste how is it done 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.590
 As a rule, in order to reduce the cost of the product 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.349
 not all manufacturers unfortunately 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:16.510
 reflect on taste and harmlessness for 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:19.390
 consumer some due 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.470
 manufacturers recommend falling asleep 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 what are the milk trickle to not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.440
 lumps can be formed so 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
 but it is optional you can fall asleep 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.859
 the main thing then when stirring clean 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.859
 all lumps 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.640
 this is the natural color of cocoa of that color 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 chocolate tastes really good too 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:01.690
 approximate jackals hot we 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:08.110
 bring to a boil 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.680
 but do not boil the principle of flavor as she 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:19.780
 revealed only when it starts 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:22.810
 boil our mass process 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.810
 cooking takes an average of three 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:32.519
 minutes that is you can do it 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.550
 fast enough sometimes manufacturers 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.860
 allowed to cook cocoa on the water they're on 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.800
 milk 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.560
 it also has the right to life but such 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.370
 the way 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:56.470
 It is making cocoa a little bit less fat 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:59.320
 more godfather the case if in cocoa 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:06.120
 contains only one hundred percent powder 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.120
 cocoa taste will be fine if 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.560
 does your drink contain any 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:20.780
 flavors it is best to cook on 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.739
 milk will taste like every kind 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.739
 chewy mix 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.100
 milk is also desirable to use 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:46.500
 quality different manufacturers now 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:52.270
 we offer quite a good choice 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.650
 23 percent fat 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:00.670
 this milk was not recovered and from 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.790
 Milk powder made from natural 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.850
 whole milk 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.310
 As a rule, the manufacturer does this. 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.240
 marking on the package so we buy 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:18.520
 milk is also advisable to read its composition 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:23.670
 we see it boil after a 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.670
 while off and pour 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.840
 chic consistency even have 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:06:00.020
 small froth chocolate 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.910
 as you can see the drink turned out beautiful 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.890
 I once again recall the importance of several 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.350
 items when cooking as a in 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.690
 the first is 100% 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:16.270
 cocoa powder 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.270
 without any additives 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.200
 secondarily 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.080
 reasonable amount of sugars not 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:31.820
 go too far and third 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:35.150
 high-quality milk is the three ingredients 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:39.640
 success and with their help i make 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.790
 really tasty as well 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.790
 I recommend to try
