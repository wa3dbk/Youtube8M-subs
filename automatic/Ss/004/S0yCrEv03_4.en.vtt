00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 You would have liked to win because of that 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.230
 to come to the last place 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 yes also that we have land that you don't 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.410
 won so that was for sure 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.940
 I found pleasing was that we 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.080
 as the game progressed 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.279
 always having to add is only good 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.140
 10 minutes in the second half 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.400
 just search when the opponent something up 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.320
 put pressure on other ways 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.090
 turns the team into it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 very quickly found the solution again 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.449
 have a lot of big competitions 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.580
 for plays tonight makes its debut here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.769
 in the jupiler league it had to give birth 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 well well i want for 90 minutes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.829
 I already indicated at the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.300
 technical staff 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.340
 that moment comes when i could play then 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 I would like to play and that makes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.739
 I basically do not care where it is hall 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.940
 is in the u can league or in the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.700
 league or in the primary 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 animal pension or the bundesliga gave you 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.860
 can name the album 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 it's just important that you take minutes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.620
 the inside how did it go 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 investment good we have kept zero and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.800
 what i say the minutes they do this with the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.300
 most importantly we think we are very good 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.489
 played I think yes divide that is that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 really did not get in trouble 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.409
 winsum duels yes and then tactically huge 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 smart so yes I think he's fine 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.040
 have done 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.540
 as long as they don't score and you get it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 a point and then we need so much device 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.960
 scoring unfortunately does not happen today 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.189
 only I think we are reasonable 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 satisfied look back at the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.330
 knew how important Johnny was from that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.220
 you go the dressing room of young ajax 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.540
 you got hooks I always find the bed 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 must always be a bit ahead of the time 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.259
 beware to every one someone 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.310
 the pick everyone knows everyone 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.020
 does it have a sense of how stupid it is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.130
 there is in a group and its group animals 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.090
 a team player 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.159
 well that was today with young 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.840
 ajax and that is nice to see 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.780
 like a play from the irish way back 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.400
 comes in a young and then use the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.960
 thermal added value but then it is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
 more with the fund group no I have to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 just work hard just like everyone else 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.820
 Then comes that you can see yourself a who 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 do I have to get hold of you 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.979
 equipment 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.570
 I had to take care of my hours 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.610
 partners to that I am also happy today 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.290
 I'm sure I have minutes 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.310
 made if it's up to you can 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.570
 participate more often 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.640
 h good so it 's always a bit 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.159
 contradictory when they play one 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.549
 He participated today with the center sun 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.319
 him and I filled in perfectly 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.910
 well that also means it's over 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.860
 comes at the expense of the playing time of what 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.690
 young boys who also like 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 give minutes from that we 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.360
 to play an away game on Thursday 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.459
 match in manchester united under 21 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.989
 well those are also good matches or 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.760
 our boys it is that us that the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.910

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.390
 the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.390
 the necessary experiences and resistance 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.180
 you might just after the Jupiler League 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.829
 three days later in the roo cans 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.519
