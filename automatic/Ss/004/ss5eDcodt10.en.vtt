00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 Good day to all and good 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 welcome to my channel oh well summer 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.660
 came almost almost all and it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.810
 does it mean that September 1 begins soon 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.060
 learning from schoolchildren and teachers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.240
 also I would like you to first of all 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.310
 wish strength patience and of course 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 get enough sleep but today I 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 prepared for you very simple 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 hairstyle and very easiest just 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.730
 easiest makeup which i think 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.690
 approach to school and university 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 so if you're interested, stay 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 with me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.260
 I start as always with refreshing water 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.710
 give me fathers we only put on 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.710
 face 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.790
 I think that summer sleepless nights are still 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.170
 We have not yet passed from someone that is why I 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.670
 I suggest you fix it thanks 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.100
 concealer more precisely using concealer and i 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.950
 I take two shades lighter 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.950
 than the tone of my skin and well under the eyes 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.170
 if you have oily skin or 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 combined fat-prone t 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.619
 I advise you to use the powder 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.750
 matting powder 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 which you can apply either to all 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 whether the face was just over and only if 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.259
 your powder is transparent but still has 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.479
 some kind of there don't forget of course 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.729
 proshka 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.310
 make your face a week as a rouge 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.050
 I will use my loved ones for now 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.799
 moment wounds from benefit in shade 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.420
 tengri 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:58.130
 they are just perfect and it seems for that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.720
 the make up will give our forest a shine and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.229
 just a little warm up 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.229
 cheeks 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.450
 talk about eyebrows next i suggest 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.270
 if your eyebrows 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.390
 very very thin if practically 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 I can not see them slightly paint over 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.060
 shadows that will be on one literally 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 shade is lighter than your hair 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 Further, the eyes I offer in this shade 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.330
 apply early in the inner corner of the eye 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.550
 to give your eyes a big 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.980
 the expressiveness of this shade is not 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.950
 possess as such a pink hint 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 or peach ideally does not fit 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.800
 for a given make up is generally perfect during 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.570
 all plans 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.670
 I'm almost at the end I'll take my 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.780
 my favorite shadows from rimmel in my shade 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.550
 033 will provide enough of a dark ottenochek 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.590
 I propose to take this very thin 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.050
 tassel literally lightly type it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.070
 shake very well and that we will 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.280
 do we slightly paint them not the line 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.360
 eyelashes to slightly highlight the eye to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.360
 it was just visible 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.069
 further offered me a place like this 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.110
 that's extreme 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.580
 I really liked this mascara thanks 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.620
 her brush 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.450
 she is very very small at very 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.220
 thin as you see almost like myself 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.230
 wand on which it holds and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.080
 apply them only on the upper cilia 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.450
 make-up look very natural 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.160
 the most natural on the lips and how 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.150
 sedan carry your favorite she just 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.620
 balm from nivea fruit shine 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.959
 wonderful smell of cherries and gives just 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.209
 the desired hue to the lips and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.690
 it should be like to me any 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.690
 schoolgirls 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.670
 Here is such a makeup turned out not 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.260
 It seems to you the most natural 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.430
 maximum imperceptible and now 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.370
 get down to the hair 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.799
 what we did if you have bangs then 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.570
 I envy you pin up with me like 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.870

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.610
 here and from two sides 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.270
 hair that can be heard short so I 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:36.190
 their laws are just one girls for her i 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.970
 I take one strand of hair I twist it from 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.970
 myself 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.580
 spend all my head 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.580
 I take again the invisibility and stab 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.509
 Then I take a bed from this side again. 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.509

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.220

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.630

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.130
 languages 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.130

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.720
