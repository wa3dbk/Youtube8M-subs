they have to to be weaned in to the
questing<00:03:24.030> experience<00:03:24.629> and<00:03:25.040> because<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.220> know

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
questing experience and because we know

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520 
questing experience and because we know
how<00:03:26.519> many<00:03:26.579> kill<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.030> clock<00:03:27.269> they<00:03:28.079> will<00:03:28.349> be

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
how many kill and clock they will be

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.629 
how many kill and clock they will be
doing<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.040> future

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
doing in the future

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.390 
doing in the future
it's<00:03:30.180> probably<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.260> very<00:03:31.500> good<00:03:31.620> idea<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:32.250> get

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
it's probably a very good idea to get

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.780 
it's probably a very good idea to get
plenty<00:03:32.669> of<00:03:32.909> practice<00:03:33.389> in<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.129> quest<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
plenty of practice in but this quest is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.159 
plenty of practice in but this quest is
completely<00:03:36.299> different<00:03:36.449> because<00:03:36.780> what<00:03:37.079> I'm

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
completely different because what I'm

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.890 
completely different because what I'm
doing<00:03:37.500> now<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.680> I'm<00:03:37.979> protecting<00:03:38.690> somebody<00:03:39.690> as

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
doing now is I'm protecting somebody as

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.569 
doing now is I'm protecting somebody as
we<00:03:40.169> got<00:03:40.260> these<00:03:40.409> ways<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.919> little<00:03:41.220> sprites

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
we got these ways of little sprites

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.939 
we got these ways of little sprites
coming<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:43.109> bar<00:03:43.260> that's<00:03:43.440> filling<00:03:43.769> at<00:03:43.859> the

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
coming in the bar that's filling at the

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.490 
coming in the bar that's filling at the
bottom<00:03:44.280> isn't<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.269> ads<00:03:45.479> being<00:03:45.780> killed<00:03:46.109> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
bottom isn't the ads being killed and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.319 
bottom isn't the ads being killed and
therefore<00:03:47.069> filling<00:03:47.370> up<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> bar<00:03:47.729> it's<00:03:48.030> purely

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
therefore filling up the bar it's purely

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.770 
therefore filling up the bar it's purely
time<00:03:48.659> all<00:03:49.470> you've<00:03:49.859> got<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.159> do<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.879> stand

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
time all you've got to do is just stand

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.530 
time all you've got to do is just stand
there<00:03:51.900> let<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> time<00:03:52.739> go<00:03:52.769> by<00:03:52.979> and<00:03:53.579> then<00:03:54.389> you'll

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
there let the time go by and then you'll

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.740 
there let the time go by and then you'll
complete<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.229> quest<00:03:55.639> but<00:03:56.639> this<00:03:56.819> one<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.449> is

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
complete that quest but this one this is

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.390 
complete that quest but this one this is
an<00:03:57.900> interesting<00:03:58.290> situation<00:03:58.739> because<00:03:59.310> we're

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
an interesting situation because we're

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.490 
an interesting situation because we're
going<00:03:59.519> into<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.150> village<00:04:00.449> and<00:04:00.689> we're<00:04:01.199> meeting
