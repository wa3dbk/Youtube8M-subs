00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
the first silver star took a long time

in<00:00:46.579> catching<00:00:47.059> up<00:00:47.180> to<00:00:47.359> me<00:00:48.010> that's<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.280> good<00:00:49.489> sign

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
in catching up to me that's a good sign

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.660 
in catching up to me that's a good sign
definitely<00:00:51.769> want<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.039> be<00:00:52.190> moving<00:00:52.519> quickly

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
definitely want to be moving quickly

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.920 
definitely want to be moving quickly
during<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.269> speedrun<00:00:57.820> let<00:00:58.820> those<00:00:59.089> long<00:00:59.449> jumps

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
during a speedrun let those long jumps

do make Mario move quickly the silver
stars<00:01:05.780> can<00:01:06.020> barely<00:01:06.560> keep<00:01:06.740> up<00:01:06.950> when<00:01:07.159> Mario<00:01:07.520> is

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
stars can barely keep up when Mario is

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.740 
stars can barely keep up when Mario is
long<00:01:08.030> jumping<00:01:08.600> away<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:11.090> here<00:01:11.299> Mario's

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
long jumping away and here Mario's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.510 
long jumping away and here Mario's
backflipping<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.830> reach<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.250> second<00:01:13.700> level

backflipping to reach the second level

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.389 
backflipping to reach the second level
that<00:01:16.520> definitely<00:01:17.240> saves<00:01:17.659> a<00:01:17.810> lot<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:18.020> time<00:01:21.399> and

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
that definitely saves a lot of time and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.510 
that definitely saves a lot of time and
