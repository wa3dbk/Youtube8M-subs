 Today I'm going to teach you what I've been 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 stuffed as white gold then another 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 time and physical because stuffed with the dream 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.550
 a lot of people asked if they could 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.710
 do as in white then decide 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 to teach you what you can do with 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 white gold also and the mass gets very 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 hot and coverage will also learn 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 and will start our revenue goes 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.820
 start making the pasta from our cap that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.680
 reminding you that all these 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.809
 Featured ingredients in the description of 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 video of youtube and ok let's get started 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.420
 so I'm going to hit the sugar 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 along with the games I'm going to hit with the flu and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.110
 until it forms a military cream, 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 concreted seeing well clarinha will 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.750
 add butter to temperature 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.660
 environment and continue and reaches to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.640
 do here there lies the butter that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.079
 has to hit well with cleiton and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
 God, you can keep the mixer. 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.320
 but also so dirty - girl, right? 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.770
 I'm going to add milk here. 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 inside one more little stir after 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 sew a kiss adds the flour and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.320
 does the part well to absorb the whole 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.820
 Europe had anything I have 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 I got it, right? 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 but let's stir well our mass're already 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 well homogeneous also has no more 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 none was here I will add the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430
 vanilla 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.520
 do not get mixed and finally with 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.789
 add 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.799
 and I'll mix it slowly slowly in the garden 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.420
 look like this 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.200
 to get my families from 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.030
 khaki 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.130
 I already took the cups and look at this one. 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.319
 a camp cake chair that you handle 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.060
 paper cups and place inside 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.100
 If you do not know, you can 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.929
 buy these families from a pot and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.159
 with the paper path inside that 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.890
 No problem 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.899
 how easy is it to quote the white gold packs 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.720
 he is and puts it inside of course 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.500
 within the still mass family with a 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.890
 shell and pour here in over the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.829
 white douro is putting the dough 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.780
 until it reaches more or less half of the 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.150
 family or just a little more 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.790
 half because otherwise it can grow without 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.470
 get out a lot, then I'll do it on 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.690
 all the while it's going to be missing 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.640
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.610
 I'll do it all and I'll remember the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.650
 oven for more or less idea is 15 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.489
 a 20 minute aÃ­lson oven you get to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.590
 eye are you waiting for a toothpick 56 ever 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.359
 is ready without being thrashed if you let 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.569
 a little bit and keep an eye on 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:52.150
 It's good to see you 're ready . 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.310
 headphones for 20 minutes good side 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.620
 now I'll cover them 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.380
 that traditional chubby chub that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.019
 endure here I'm going to start beating 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.940
 butter your hand only crime butter're 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.040
 so not ready 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.049
 I'm going to add half the sugar 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.019
 confectioner, I'm just going to sit down 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.090
 half what I'm supposed to be looking at 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.580
 point to know is the point is that I 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.200
 I play everything and arrive 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.900
 get to the point right milk and also to 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.600
 when a brief mixed with the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.370
 spatula that is not to fly too 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.430
 sugar when I called third 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.340
 This way it will not fly I'll introduce 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.490
 all the rest of the sugar to finish 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.450
 make our coverage right 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.570
 I reached a point in my coverage 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.850
 look very good coverage too go 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.190
 get an escape that we decorate for 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.650
 decorate what is very easy you place 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.990
 cover in a bag of confectioners and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.750
 With me you want to make a 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.890
 pretty decoration goes squeezing and goes 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.350
 turning to form is the little flower that 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.520
 Speak and listen to the little heart up here. 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.160
 fine 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.160
