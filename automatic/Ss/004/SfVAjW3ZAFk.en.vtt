you<00:03:18.390> know<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.750> feels<00:03:19.110> pretty<00:03:19.349> good

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
you know it feels pretty good

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.530

out-of-the-box<00:03:20.040> what<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.819> did<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.420> we

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
out-of-the-box what we did on it is we

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.500 
out-of-the-box what we did on it is we
did<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> fret<00:03:22.049> level<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:23.610> crowning<00:03:24.090> polish

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
did a fret level in crowning polish

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.530 
did a fret level in crowning polish
because<00:03:25.400> often<00:03:26.400> these<00:03:26.549> guitars<00:03:26.790> don't<00:03:27.330> play

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
because often these guitars don't play

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.120 
because often these guitars don't play

as well out of the boxes they're capable
of<00:03:29.430> playing<00:03:29.840> they<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:31.019> need<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> be<00:03:31.500> set<00:03:31.769> up

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980

of playing they just need to be set up
you<00:03:32.549> know<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.390> they<00:03:33.660> need<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:34.079> many<00:03:34.560> cases<00:03:35.010> in

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you know and they need in many cases in

you know and they need in many cases in
almost<00:03:35.700> all<00:03:35.910> cases<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.420> would<00:03:36.480> say<00:03:36.780> they'll

almost all cases I would say they'll

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.080 
almost all cases I would say they'll

so<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.860> guitar<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.840> left<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.200> we<00:04:31.440> did<00:04:31.590> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
so this guitar we left that we did the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.470 
so this guitar we left that we did the
threat<00:04:32.040> level<00:04:32.070> but<00:04:32.670> we<00:04:32.760> left<00:04:32.940> everything<00:04:33.090> else

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
threat level but we left everything else

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.050 
threat level but we left everything else
stock<00:04:33.960> we<00:04:34.830> did<00:04:34.980> replace<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.520> pickups<00:04:35.910> and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
stock we did replace the pickups and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.120 
stock we did replace the pickups and
these<00:04:36.180> are<00:04:36.330> fenders<00:04:36.660> no<00:04:36.930> caster<00:04:37.500> custom<00:04:37.920> shop

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
these are fenders no caster custom shop

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.200 
these are fenders no caster custom shop
no<00:04:38.310> Castro<00:04:38.730> pickups<00:04:40.460> they've<00:04:41.460> got<00:04:41.790> vintage

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
no Castro pickups they've got vintage

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.360 
no Castro pickups they've got vintage
construction<00:04:42.930> they've<00:04:43.740> got<00:04:43.950> sort<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.250> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
construction they've got sort of a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.160 
construction they've got sort of a
vintage<00:04:44.520> output<00:04:45.120> which<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.930> tend<00:04:46.140> to

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
vintage output which I like I tend to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.930 
vintage output which I like I tend to
like<00:04:46.260> weaker<00:04:46.770> output<00:04:47.130> pickups<00:04:47.520> rather<00:04:47.730> than

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
like weaker output pickups rather than

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.670 
like weaker output pickups rather than
stronger<00:04:48.390> output<00:04:48.750> pickups<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.500> those

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
stronger output pickups I like those

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.860 
stronger output pickups I like those
kind<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:50.010> twanging<00:04:50.340> bright<00:04:50.820> Chinese<00:04:51.330> fender

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
kind of twanging bright Chinese fender

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.340 
kind of twanging bright Chinese fender
tones<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.940> also<00:04:54.090> put<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> four-position<00:04:54.810> switch

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
tones we also put a four-position switch

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.900 
tones we also put a four-position switch
in<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.710> one<00:04:55.860> instead<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.550> stock

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
in this one instead of the stock

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.120 
in this one instead of the stock
three-position<00:04:57.630> switch<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.500> we<00:04:58.860> can

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
three-position switch so that we can

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.030 
three-position switch so that we can
combine<00:04:59.370> these<00:04:59.970> two<00:05:00.360> pickups<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:01.110> parallel<00:05:01.770> as

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
combine these two pickups in parallel as

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.910 
combine these two pickups in parallel as
is<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.460> norm<00:05:02.990> but<00:05:03.990> we<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.200> also<00:05:04.350> combine<00:05:04.680> them

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
is the norm but we can also combine them

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.530 
is the norm but we can also combine them
in<00:05:05.010> series<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.640> get<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.820> little<00:05:06.060> bit<00:05:06.180> fuller

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
in series so you get a little bit fuller

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.530 
in series so you get a little bit fuller
warmer<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:09.180> I'll<00:05:09.390> sort<00:05:09.630> of<00:05:09.780> demonstrate<00:05:10.290> that

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
warmer and I'll sort of demonstrate that

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.670 
warmer and I'll sort of demonstrate that
when<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.660> combine<00:05:13.080> coils<00:05:13.680> together<00:05:15.140> if<00:05:16.140> one

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
when you combine coils together if one

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.290 
when you combine coils together if one
of<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.920> pickups<00:05:17.310> is<00:05:17.490> reverse<00:05:17.850> one<00:05:18.090> under

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
of the pickups is reverse one under

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.590 
of the pickups is reverse one under
reverse<00:05:18.660> polarity<00:05:19.080> relative<00:05:19.830> to<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:20.130> other

reverse polarity relative to the other

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.270

know<00:05:38.730> this<00:05:38.940> this<00:05:39.240> guitar<00:05:39.690> comes<00:05:39.990> with<00:05:40.320> a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
know this this guitar comes with a

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.850 
know this this guitar comes with a
different-looking<00:05:41.330> bridge<00:05:42.350> with<00:05:43.350> six

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
bridge footprint on the stockbridge

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.920 
bridge footprint on the stockbridge
comes<00:06:20.790> out<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.090> about<00:06:21.180> here<00:06:21.540> it's<00:06:21.690> about<00:06:21.900> a

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
comes out to about here it's about a

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.720 
comes out to about here it's about a
half<00:06:22.169> an<00:06:22.320> inch<00:06:22.410> longer<00:06:22.800> so<00:06:23.220> we<00:06:23.340> had<00:06:23.490> some

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
half an inch longer so we had some

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.570 
half an inch longer so we had some
concern<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:25.280> replacing<00:06:26.280> it<00:06:26.400> with<00:06:26.430> this

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
concern that replacing it with this

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.430 
concern that replacing it with this
bridge<00:06:27.120> would

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
bridge would

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.050 
bridge would
you<00:06:29.440> know<00:06:29.560> would<00:06:29.950> leave<00:06:30.130> in<00:06:30.280> an<00:06:30.460> area<00:06:30.700> of<00:06:30.910> the

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
you know would leave in an area of the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.790 
you know would leave in an area of the
finish<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.510> was<00:06:31.690> imprinted<00:06:32.200> from<00:06:32.680> the

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
finish that was imprinted from the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.920 
finish that was imprinted from the
earlier<00:06:33.190> bridge<00:06:33.520> but<00:06:34.150> that's<00:06:34.360> not<00:06:34.600> the<00:06:34.810> case

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
earlier bridge but that's not the case

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.560 
earlier bridge but that's not the case
on<00:06:35.170> this<00:06:35.320> guitar<00:06:35.530> I<00:06:36.190> don't<00:06:36.790> know<00:06:36.970> if<00:06:37.180> that's<00:06:37.360> if

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
on this guitar I don't know if that's if

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.940 
on this guitar I don't know if that's if
we're<00:06:37.690> going<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.870> find<00:06:38.080> consistently<00:06:38.800> that

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
we're going to find consistently that

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.010 
we're going to find consistently that
that's<00:06:39.130> the<00:06:39.340> case<00:06:39.370> or<00:06:39.700> not<00:06:39.880> but<00:06:40.660> in<00:06:40.870> this

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
that's the case or not but in this

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.140 
that's the case or not but in this
guitar<00:06:41.380> there's<00:06:41.980> no<00:06:42.190> indication<00:06:42.520> at<00:06:42.940> all<00:06:43.090> that

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
guitar there's no indication at all that

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.600 
guitar there's no indication at all that
this<00:06:43.900> was<00:06:44.140> not<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.350> Stockbridge<00:06:45.010> from<00:06:45.250> Fender

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
this was not the Stockbridge from Fender

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.570 
this was not the Stockbridge from Fender
so<00:06:46.090> it<00:06:46.150> worked<00:06:46.300> out<00:06:46.510> well
