and exceed their energy level will be

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.630 
and exceed their energy level will be
fine<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.759> master<00:01:30.209> energy<00:01:30.509> level<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.310> go

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
fine if we master energy level it can go

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
fine if we master energy level it can go
either<00:01:32.670> way<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.660> they're<00:01:33.780> probably<00:01:34.050> going

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
either way and they're probably going

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
either way and they're probably going
their<00:01:34.709> favor<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.340> only<00:01:35.459> match<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.030> not

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
their favor if we only match it and not

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
their favor if we only match it and not
exceed<00:01:36.599> their<00:01:36.780> engine<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.229> i<00:01:37.349> think<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.679> last

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
exceed their engine up i think the last
