00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.670
 notes installing maps on android and 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.790
 any map on android does not 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.150
 we needed to be road or nonsense of 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.150
 those 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.810
 what is going to tell you this is a map of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.770
 lost castle that is the first the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 first map that I played on the channel if 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.349
 you remember that it was in excel and it is the best 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.599
 example of teaching you because you have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.920
 been asking very much how it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.280
 download the map as you download the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.470
 Map 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.480
 in them 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.040
 in a facilitated the world knows it but not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 if there are many people if you do not know 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 no message and recorded how they are made 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.380
 them because I have the ipad but that is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 where I'm recording this but to the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.060
 same time sign of the big android 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.100
 android that we need a file 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.500
 external an external application that the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.260
 you can find in the play store is a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.190
 decompressor is to say an equal with the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.590
 what would any decompression do 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.000
 the coupons of the play store zip 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.550
 city â€‹â€‹decompressor until the first one 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.730
 free, so let's download the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.410
 map we go from the beginning 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.300
 I'm already starting downloads 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.620

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.620
 that the 16 that what 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.880
 because I tried to record this before 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 we'll see 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.990
 without you title 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.960
 yes good download before but I teach it 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.320

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.980
 with the lost castle and the rod 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.940
 downloaded it is worth it now 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.690
 from here or downloading it to dorothy if 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.620
 it's called and well it does not work perfect it's 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.760
 free in a play store 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.250
 you can create this application and now 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.960
 you have to look for it 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.570
 the first when you download that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.440

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.760
 documents download I was wrong 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 I feel that the quality is not very good 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.230
 but that's what the ipad gives me could 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.470
 put a little more back the s4 but 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.959

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.730
 let's roll more as you see I have two 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.620
 archives of the lost castle alone 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.569

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.780

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.420

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.700
