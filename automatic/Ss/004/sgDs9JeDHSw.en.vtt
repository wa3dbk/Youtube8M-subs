00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
well let's take a look I think it's time

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.520 
well let's take a look I think it's time
to<00:00:06.160> have<00:00:06.399> another<00:00:06.460> card<00:00:06.910> selected<00:00:07.420> let<00:00:08.410> me

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
to have another card selected let me

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.270 
to have another card selected let me
give<00:00:08.770> the<00:00:08.889> cards<00:00:09.190> a<00:00:09.309> quick<00:00:09.790> shuffle<00:00:11.280> excellent

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
give the cards a quick shuffle excellent

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.999 
give the cards a quick shuffle excellent
you<00:00:13.269> know<00:00:13.420> I<00:00:13.450> would<00:00:14.290> like<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.559> have<00:00:14.679> a<00:00:14.710> card

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
you know I would like to have a card

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.400 
you know I would like to have a card
selected<00:00:15.070> by<00:00:15.730> maybe<00:00:16.390> cutting<00:00:16.779> the<00:00:17.020> cards

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
selected by maybe cutting the cards

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.790 
selected by maybe cutting the cards
let's<00:00:17.800> try<00:00:18.070> it<00:00:18.130> in<00:00:18.279> this<00:00:18.430> fashion<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:20.020> would

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
let's try it in this fashion I would

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.070 
let's try it in this fashion I would
like<00:00:20.920> you<00:00:21.100> to<00:00:21.130> cut<00:00:21.880> maybe<00:00:22.150> about<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.539> quarter<00:00:23.050> of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
like you to cut maybe about a quarter of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.800 
like you to cut maybe about a quarter of
the<00:00:23.260> deck<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:24.000> flip<00:00:25.000> them<00:00:25.150> over<00:00:25.269> like<00:00:25.570> this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
the deck and flip them over like this

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.019 
the deck and flip them over like this
that's<00:00:26.260> good<00:00:26.590> and<00:00:26.800> then<00:00:27.279> maybe<00:00:27.460> cut<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.789> little

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
that's good and then maybe cut a little

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.450 
that's good and then maybe cut a little
bit<00:00:28.119> deeper<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.840> we'll<00:00:29.710> flip<00:00:29.890> those<00:00:30.130> over

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
bit deeper and we'll flip those over

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.910 
bit deeper and we'll flip those over
again<00:00:30.760> that<00:00:31.420> way<00:00:31.599> we<00:00:31.810> really<00:00:32.230> get<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.410> random

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
again that way we really get a random

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.310 
again that way we really get a random
selection<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.910> see<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.960> wouldn't<00:00:35.230> be

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
selection you see you wouldn't be

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.229 
selection you see you wouldn't be
picking<00:00:35.470> one<00:00:35.799> of<00:00:35.920> these<00:00:36.040> you<00:00:36.339> would<00:00:36.460> be<00:00:36.670> taking

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
picking one of these you would be taking

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.689 
picking one of these you would be taking
say<00:00:37.479> that<00:00:37.690> card<00:00:38.019> right<00:00:38.739> there<00:00:38.769> and<00:00:39.250> in<00:00:39.580> this

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
say that card right there and in this

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.850 
say that card right there and in this
case<00:00:39.970> it<00:00:40.150> would<00:00:40.269> be<00:00:40.299> the<00:00:40.420> two<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.720> clubs<00:00:41.019> so<00:00:41.379> you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
case it would be the two of clubs so you

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.590 
case it would be the two of clubs so you
know<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:42.190> idea<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.640> what<00:00:42.760> I'm<00:00:42.879> trying<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:43.239> get

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
know the idea of what I'm trying to get

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.170 
know the idea of what I'm trying to get
you<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.870> do<00:00:44.019> excellent<00:00:44.979> I<00:00:45.309> would<00:00:46.000> now<00:00:46.150> ask

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
you to do excellent I would now ask

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.420 
you to do excellent I would now ask
somebody<00:00:46.839> to<00:00:46.900> cut<00:00:47.559> about<00:00:47.799> a<00:00:47.860> quarter<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.339> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
somebody to cut about a quarter of the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.359 
somebody to cut about a quarter of the
deck<00:00:48.900> flip<00:00:49.900> those<00:00:50.110> cards<00:00:50.470> over<00:00:50.739> on<00:00:50.860> top<00:00:51.100> and

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:51.369 
deck flip those cards over on top and

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:54.750 
deck flip those cards over on top and
then<00:00:51.610> cut<00:00:51.850> deeper<00:00:52.479> and<00:00:53.220> flip<00:00:54.220> those<00:00:54.430> cards

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
then cut deeper and flip those cards

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.009 
then cut deeper and flip those cards
over<00:00:55.030> perfect<00:00:55.750> now<00:00:56.260> we<00:00:56.290> have<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.710> really<00:00:57.280> random

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
over perfect now we have a really random

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.079 
over perfect now we have a really random
cutting<00:00:59.019> of<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.260> cards<00:00:59.619> and<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.640> first<00:01:00.820> card

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
cutting of the cards and the first card

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.869 
cutting of the cards and the first card
we<00:01:01.269> come<00:01:01.479> to<00:01:01.689> is<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.260> selected<00:01:02.830> card<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.760> know

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
we come to is the selected card you know

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.480 
we come to is the selected card you know
I<00:01:03.909> do<00:01:04.089> believe<00:01:04.659> that<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.140> our<00:01:05.350> force<00:01:05.920> card<00:01:06.250> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
I do believe that is our force card the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.310 
I do believe that is our force card the
ace<00:01:07.299> of<00:01:07.510> hearts<00:01:07.830> yes<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:09.010> is<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.170> the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
ace of hearts yes it is this is the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.070 
ace of hearts yes it is this is the
Balducci<00:01:11.920> force<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:13.330> is<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.570> better

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
Balducci force and this is a better

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.830 
Balducci force and this is a better
handling<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.860> what<00:01:15.010> was<00:01:15.160> also<00:01:15.580> called<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.540> cut

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
handling of what was also called the cut

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.030 
handling of what was also called the cut
deeper<00:01:17.410> force<00:01:17.940> here's<00:01:18.940> how<00:01:19.150> it's<00:01:19.330> handled<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
deeper force here's how it's handled the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.730 
deeper force here's how it's handled the
Balducci<00:01:21.640> force<00:01:21.910> this<00:01:22.810> card<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.560> go

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
Balducci force this card is going to go

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.250 
Balducci force this card is going to go
second<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.940> see<00:01:25.150> in<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> cut<00:01:25.600> deeper<00:01:25.960> force

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
second you see in the cut deeper force

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.350 
second you see in the cut deeper force
the<00:01:26.740> force<00:01:26.980> card<00:01:27.340> would<00:01:27.520> merely<00:01:27.790> be<00:01:27.940> on<00:01:28.180> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
the force card would merely be on the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.300 
the force card would merely be on the
top<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.870> pack<00:01:29.110> I<00:01:29.440> would<00:01:30.130> then<00:01:30.280> ask

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
top of the pack I would then ask

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.480 
top of the pack I would then ask
somebody<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.240> cut<00:01:31.420> off<00:01:31.570> about<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.310> quarter<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
somebody to cut off about a quarter of

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.120 
somebody to cut off about a quarter of
the<00:01:33.670> deck<00:01:33.850> or<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.120> small<00:01:34.480> group<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.930> cards<00:01:35.320> flip

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
the deck or a small group of cards flip

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.450 
the deck or a small group of cards flip
those<00:01:36.370> cards<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.070> would<00:01:39.280> ask

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
those cards over and then I would ask

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.490 
those cards over and then I would ask
them<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:39.730> cut<00:01:39.970> deeper<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.540> flip<00:01:40.960> those<00:01:41.170> over

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
them to cut deeper and flip those over

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.899 
them to cut deeper and flip those over
again<00:01:41.770> this<00:01:42.520> way<00:01:42.730> we<00:01:42.940> get<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.120> really<00:01:43.480> random

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
again this way we get a really random

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.180 
again this way we get a really random
cut<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.120> card<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.659> would<00:01:47.409> merely<00:01:47.590> spread<00:01:48.040> these

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
cut to card I would merely spread these

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.370 
cut to card I would merely spread these
cards<00:01:48.550> over<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.060> hand<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.720> card<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.170> that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
cards over and hand that card out that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.950 
cards over and hand that card out that
would<00:01:50.530> be<00:01:50.560> our<00:01:50.740> force<00:01:51.040> card<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:52.060> see<00:01:52.270> Balducci

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
would be our force card you see Balducci

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.649 
would be our force card you see Balducci
had<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.320> idea<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.740> placing<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.909> card<00:01:54.970> our

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
had the idea of placing this card our

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.860 
had the idea of placing this card our
force<00:01:56.140> card<00:01:56.520> second<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.270> mentioned<00:01:58.659> a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
force card second as I mentioned a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.320 
force card second as I mentioned a
moment<00:01:59.440> earlier<00:01:59.500> you<00:02:00.400> see<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:00.729> way<00:02:00.940> he<00:02:01.180> can

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
moment earlier you see this way he can
