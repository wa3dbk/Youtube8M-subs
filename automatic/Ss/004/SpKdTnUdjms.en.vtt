00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.620 
I use the cross draw style and what
happens<00:01:05.860> is<00:01:05.979> works<00:01:06.970> really<00:01:07.210> great<00:01:07.360> you<00:01:07.479> can

if you're working at camp you can
actually<00:01:13.960> access<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.619> pretty<00:01:15.190> easily<00:01:15.399> I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
actually access it pretty easily I

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.219 
actually access it pretty easily I
actually<00:01:16.330> added<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:18.630> safety<00:01:19.630> kind<00:01:20.050> of<00:01:20.140> like

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
actually added this safety kind of like

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.370 
actually added this safety kind of like
a<00:01:20.289> double<00:01:20.470> lock<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:21.670> use<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.300> linear<00:01:22.869> anyways

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
a double lock I use this linear anyways

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.940 
a double lock I use this linear anyways
if<00:01:23.679> I'm<00:01:23.770> gonna<00:01:23.890> be<00:01:24.039> doing<00:01:24.220> some<00:01:24.369> chopping<00:01:25.950> I'll

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
if I'm gonna be doing some chopping I'll

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.380 
if I'm gonna be doing some chopping I'll
be<00:01:27.100> using<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:27.729> fashion<00:01:27.940> here<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:30.550> it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
be using it in this fashion here so it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.760 
be using it in this fashion here so it
gives<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> pretty<00:01:31.869> pretty<00:01:32.229> decent<00:01:32.560> grip

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
gives you a pretty pretty decent grip

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.840 
gives you a pretty pretty decent grip
and<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.119> still<00:01:34.300> look<00:01:34.330> go<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.850> what

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
and you can still look go of it but what

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.219 
and you can still look go of it but what
happens<00:01:36.880> is<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.300> if<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:37.630> are<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.050> bush

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
happens is that if you are in the bush

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.889 
happens is that if you are in the bush
you<00:01:38.920> could<00:01:39.100> snag<00:01:39.399> this<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:40.750> know<00:01:40.840> you

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
you could snag this and you know you

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.060 
you could snag this and you know you
could<00:01:41.110> pull<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.350> out<00:01:41.410> it<00:01:41.530> does<00:01:41.649> have<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:42.039> does

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
could pull it out it does have it does

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.440 
could pull it out it does have it does
hold<00:01:42.340> some<00:01:42.399> decent<00:01:42.820> pressure<00:01:43.000> but<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.330> could

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hold some decent pressure but it could

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.680 
hold some decent pressure but it could
pull<00:01:43.600> out<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.380> opted<00:01:44.800> for<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.039> toggle<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.659> I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
pull out so I opted for a toggle that I

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.620 
pull out so I opted for a toggle that I
placed<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.710> position<00:01:48.130> here<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:49.239> I<00:01:49.450> just

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
placed in this position here and I just

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.809 
placed in this position here and I just
give<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.929> little<00:01:50.050> a<00:01:50.319> little<00:01:50.619> tug<00:01:50.950> here<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
give it a little a little tug here and

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.839 
give it a little a little tug here and
it's<00:01:52.479> been<00:01:52.630> good<00:01:52.869> plug<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.950> cross-draw<00:01:54.429> so

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
it's been good plug the cross-draw so

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's been good plug the cross-draw so
again<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.330> tech<00:01:55.509> lock<00:01:55.750> when<00:01:55.959> you<00:01:56.020> take<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.289> off

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
again the tech lock when you take it off

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.490 
again the tech lock when you take it off
you're<00:01:56.679> flipping<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.220> front<00:01:57.429> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you're flipping it to the front and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.570 
you're flipping it to the front and
you're<00:01:59.500> gonna<00:01:59.590> squeeze<00:01:59.920> these<00:02:00.130> two<00:02:00.310> prongs

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
you're gonna squeeze these two prongs

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.479 
you're gonna squeeze these two prongs
and<00:02:00.940> get<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.569> out<00:02:01.660> this<00:02:01.810> is<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.989> 1<00:02:02.259> inch<00:02:02.319> web<00:02:03.220> belt

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
and get it out this is a 1 inch web belt

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.260 
and get it out this is a 1 inch web belt
and<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:05.200> we've<00:02:05.319> got<00:02:05.500> here<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.979> some<00:02:06.729> spacers

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
pull out as you can see these spacers

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.729 
pull out as you can see these spacers

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
also by putting the tech lock on this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.860 
also by putting the tech lock on this
way<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.610> wanted<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:33.940> do<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.360> Scout

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
way if you wanted to do like Scout

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.170 
way if you wanted to do like Scout
Ranger<00:02:35.200> carry<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.920> other<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:37.000> could

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
Ranger carry on the other side you could

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.580 
Ranger carry on the other side you could
do<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:39.030> when<00:02:40.030> you're<00:02:40.239> removing<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
do that and when you're removing the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.390 
do that and when you're removing the
blade<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.700> you're<00:02:43.300> taking<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:43.720> out<00:02:44.340> you'll<00:02:45.340> be

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
blade and you're taking it out you'll be

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
blade and you're taking it out you'll be
coming<00:02:45.760> out<00:02:45.849> in<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.030> position<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.379> it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
coming out in this position so it

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.140 
coming out in this position so it
depends<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.069> what<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> like

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
I actually cross draw I like the safety

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.550 
I actually cross draw I like the safety
