00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.990 
weeks off and i came back in Shanghai in
one<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.979> should<00:01:34.220> probably<00:01:34.250> catch<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.789> more

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
one so you should probably catch it more

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.880 
one so you should probably catch it more
often<00:01:35.119> huh<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:38.080> all<00:01:39.080> those<00:01:39.229> be<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.710> was<00:01:39.800> on

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
often huh but all those be that was on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.010 
often huh but all those be that was on
location<00:01:40.039> area<00:01:40.490> then<00:01:41.390> play<00:01:41.600> like<00:01:41.630> three

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
location area then play like three

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.010 
location area then play like three
months<00:01:42.289> now<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.700> think<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.119> that<00:01:44.420> for<00:01:44.929> that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
months now so I think it's that for that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.669 
months now so I think it's that for that
side<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.289> them<00:01:45.560> I'm<00:01:45.920> very<00:01:46.899> excited<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.560> it's

guess showed up when it mattered the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.390 
guess showed up when it mattered the
most<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:24.140> what<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.040> expect<00:02:25.310> from

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
most and that's what you can expect from

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.890 
most and that's what you can expect from
their<00:02:25.640> work<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:25.880> he<00:02:25.910> makes<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.390> finest<00:02:26.750> for

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
their work if he makes the finest for
