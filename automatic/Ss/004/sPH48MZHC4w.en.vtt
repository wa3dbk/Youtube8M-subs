naturalness<00:01:28.160> of<00:01:28.369> me<00:01:28.520> at<00:01:28.970> first<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.420> didn't<00:01:29.899> even

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
naturalness of me at first I didn't even

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.499

want<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.590> be<00:01:30.740> apparent<00:01:31.160> that<00:01:31.509> we

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
want it to be apparent that we

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.180 
want it to be apparent that we
understood<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.050> was<00:01:33.200> from<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.440> play<00:01:33.649> but<00:01:33.920> just

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
understood it was from the play but just

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.190 
understood it was from the play but just
using<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.960> stage<00:01:36.649> directions<00:01:37.190> from<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.789> play

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
using the stage directions from a play

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.749 
using the stage directions from a play
that<00:01:39.200> means<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.770> people<00:01:40.070> are<00:01:40.159> coming<00:01:40.369> on<00:01:40.580> and

of being onstage it contains a lot of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.210 
of being onstage it contains a lot of
elements<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.509> we<00:01:59.899> had<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.950> process
