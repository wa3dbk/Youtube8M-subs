00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 speaks guys my name alex over 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 head editor of fashion censorship site 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.280
 Wow, I came back to talk a little 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.190
 Duke Lucas's hair a lot of you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.889
 asked me to remember that the cut of the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.960
 your hair will influence too much in the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.260
 hairstyle because it is not any cut of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 hair that will bear is the hairstyle in the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.100
 Which one does he currently use? 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.330
 if you do not know what his hairstyle is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.840
 very simple 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.609
 he does a gradient of machines here is 2 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 3 and 4 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.680
 And here he makes an amendment with 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 scissors and leaves longer wires 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.440
 at the top leaving shorter 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 behind and the fringe a little more 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 accomplished record that volume and that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 I look back as soon as I 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.480
 I'm going to teach you to give this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 look sort of back for any 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.550
 kind of texture it's cool to wash with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.489
 shampoo and dispense the conditioner when 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.079
 you are doing hairstyle why because 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.010
 the conditioner leaves the wires 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.680
 heavy 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 So you'll need a comb 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 dryer brush and a finisher in which 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.549
 you choose 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 and I've already washed mine with shampoo 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.700
 As I told you, they're going to make the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.130
 wax finish 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.570
 if you do not know there is which one to buy 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 and how to handle 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460
 It's just you, there, our youtube channel. 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.650
 that there is a step by step how to use 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.740
 correctly wax and make a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 finalization in observed aspect 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.960
 that many have doubts there when it comes to using 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.259
 the wax and ends up leaving the hair with 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.079
 dirty look is to start you pass 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.630
 a thermal protector in my hair I use 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 I used it there in the last video of the card 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.420
 I always use it to give a protected 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.310
 in the wires when it is drying is if your 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 hair is thick curled you will have a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.439
 work at the time of drying because 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.500
 you will have to analyze the wires as you 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.969
 will perform 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.469
 brush with thermal protector also for 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.229

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.030
 armed traffic because you're going to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.620
 structure the hair with a finisher 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.069
 when he had to be with you 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.390
 structure and leave it the way it is 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.390

 craft passes that now is just passing 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.760

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.290
 your hair has difficulty staying 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.630
 armed here in front 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.790

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.000
 O O separate simple game only fringe 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.250

 no people have no excuse textures are 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.540
 Different and all the hair can do 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.420
 only with a different degree of difficulty 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.670
 but if you 're going to catch it, 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:50.270
 mecha and chicó take that wave from here she 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.740
 will give an aid to a navy in the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.230
 your hair 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.210
 look at that with the hair when it is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.760
 100 or conditioner 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.750
 as it already gives a structured one is seeing 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.380
 already gave a structure I spent here 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.050
 a little wax in the hands of Fernando 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.050
 that is to be she is always at the tip of the finger 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.760
 How did I tell you about our previous video? 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.220
 and 6 goes through the threads and playing 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.310
 sense backwards 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.370
 also here in the case the lucas hair 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.340
 crazy he wore a little shorter but 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.390
 now he is opting not only for it 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.820
 but like other artists opting for a 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.240
 tutor longer wires né by 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.300
 fuller hairstyle then do not brand 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.760
 much here with a machine because it no longer 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.530
 is in the fashion and also because of 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.710
 of the fashion season also that people 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.110
 ji hair is even as full as 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:57.590
 You already played here behind you, you get the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:03.310
 son of the fringe and goes playing and playing 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:06.950
 behind which already begins to give the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.770
 hairstyle best game very simple of 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.600
 do even with your own hand with 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.720
 own hand 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.750
 You're going to throw your hair back. 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.330
 I'm already getting it right 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.160
 in the field using the camera as a mirror and 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.350
 my size a little more differentiated 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.660
 because my shave and no one until the 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.360
 You're complaining about the top 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.010
 iquique your cut does not give my shaving is 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.410
 a little closer than a cut 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.330
 different is giving to make you 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.510
 do the same scheme also adapt there 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.630
 in your haircut that works 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.270
 arrived saw it got a little fallen comes 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.580
 with content everything will work 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.800
 nothing is easy because many there that that 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.540
 who say that they can not 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.330
 who can not not can not clear that 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.730
 can you tactfully anyone 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.000
 get what they like you played 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.520
 here inside 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.130
 Oops of excess here 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.100
 with a little too much wax just play 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:16.130
 back over to the other wires in 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:19.490
 which'm not here you come with a little 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:27.290
 wax is a little bit old and 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:32.000
 your hair is how do you see 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:35.260
 You are thrown back hair just right the 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.150
 hair is a little more fulfilled 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.880
 so I'm making an adaptation and 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.580
 going modeler if you have 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.220
 doing wax care not to stay 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:52.160
 with appearance of staged beauty to ió 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.320
 if there is an affront it is very simple 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.510
 run the galley 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.970

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.010
 Do you want to make a change? 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.370
 You can throw it all back the way. 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:07.100
 here's another tip you want 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:10.910
 play it a little more to the side oh okay 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.310
 seeing it gives a cool aspect too 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.800
