00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
test is pretty simple all we're going to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
test is pretty simple all we're going to
be<00:00:47.579> doing<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.940> importing<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> same<00:00:48.719> exact

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
be doing is importing the same exact

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110 
be doing is importing the same exact
footage<00:00:49.200> used<00:00:50.039> airdrop<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.670> transfer<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.090> over

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
footage used airdrop to transfer it over

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.260 
footage used airdrop to transfer it over
to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> 15-inch<00:00:51.840> laptop<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.820> go<00:00:53.820> ahead<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to the 15-inch laptop and go ahead and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700 
to the 15-inch laptop and go ahead and
see<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:54.480> fast<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.020> generate<00:00:55.320> thumbnail

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
see how fast you can generate thumbnail

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.260 
see how fast you can generate thumbnail
see<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.039> fast<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> render<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
see how fast it can render it out just

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
see how fast it can render it out just
so<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:57.780> inside<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> iMovie<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.859> ahead

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so we can use inside of iMovie go ahead

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.279 
so we can use inside of iMovie go ahead
and<00:00:59.129> edit<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> it<00:01:00.570> looks<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and edit it and it looks like the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
and edit it and it looks like the
15-inch<00:01:01.710> MacBook<00:01:01.829> Pro<00:01:02.190> completely<00:01:02.820> sweeps

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
15-inch MacBook Pro completely sweeps

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.390 
15-inch MacBook Pro completely sweeps
the<00:01:03.750> floor<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> 13-inch<00:01:04.739> MacBook<00:01:04.890> Pro

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the floor with the 13-inch MacBook Pro

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
the floor with the 13-inch MacBook Pro
so<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.630> we're<00:01:06.780> doing<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> adding

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
so right here all we're doing is adding

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
so right here all we're doing is adding
some<00:01:07.530> effects<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> both<00:01:08.159> clips<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.670> both

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
some effects to both clips they're both

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.399 
some effects to both clips they're both
exactly<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> same<00:01:09.479> effect<00:01:09.570> same<00:01:09.990> filters

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
exactly the same effect same filters

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.380 
exactly the same effect same filters
same<00:01:10.680> picture<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.010> picture<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.299> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
same picture in picture all that so this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.460 
same picture in picture all that so this
is<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> make<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.110> easy<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.320> possible

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
is going to make it as easy as possible

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
is going to make it as easy as possible
to<00:01:13.950> calculate<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.700> export<00:01:15.270> times<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.200> right

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to calculate the export times so right

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.179 
to calculate the export times so right
now<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:16.530> exporting<00:01:16.799> we're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
now we're exporting we're going to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.560 
now we're exporting we're going to
export<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.700> QuickTime<00:01:18.090> mess<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.420> some

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
export with QuickTime mess with some

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
export with QuickTime mess with some
settings<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> export<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.590> 1080p<00:01:19.950> we're<00:01:20.729> going

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
settings and export in 1080p we're going

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.010 
settings and export in 1080p we're going
to<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.420> beat<00:01:21.720> each<00:01:21.840> other

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to see which one can beat each other

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.840 
to see which one can beat each other
remember<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> 13-inch<00:01:23.280> MacBook<00:01:23.430> Pro

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
remember that the 13-inch MacBook Pro

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.920 
remember that the 13-inch MacBook Pro
has<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.240> solid-state<00:01:24.689> drive

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
has a solid-state drive

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.130 
has a solid-state drive
whereas<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.920> 15-inch<00:01:26.310> MacBook<00:01:26.430> Pro<00:01:26.880> has<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
whereas the 15-inch MacBook Pro has a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.370 
whereas the 15-inch MacBook Pro has a
5400<00:01:28.140> rpm<00:01:28.640> 750<00:01:29.640> gigabyte<00:01:29.759> hard<00:01:30.329> drive<00:01:30.479> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
5400 rpm 750 gigabyte hard drive so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
5400 rpm 750 gigabyte hard drive so
let's<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.710> ahead<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> let's<00:01:32.280> see<00:01:32.460> who<00:01:32.670> wins

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.180 

so<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.690> 15-inch<00:01:40.110> MacBook<00:01:40.170> Pro<00:01:40.620> absolutely

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
so the 15-inch MacBook Pro absolutely

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.040 
so the 15-inch MacBook Pro absolutely
destroyed<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> 13-inch<00:01:42.270> MacBook<00:01:42.479> Pro<00:01:42.870> in

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
destroyed the 13-inch MacBook Pro in

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.140 
destroyed the 13-inch MacBook Pro in
this<00:01:43.229> render<00:01:43.560> test<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.670> surprising

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
this render test it's not surprising

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.940 
this render test it's not surprising
because<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.690> lot<00:01:45.960> better<00:01:46.170> CPU<00:01:46.650> as<00:01:46.800> well

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
because it has a lot better CPU as well

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
because it has a lot better CPU as well
as<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> lot<00:01:47.250> better<00:01:47.460> graphics<00:01:47.850> card<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.300> other

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
as a lot better graphics card but other

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.380 
as a lot better graphics card but other
than<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:50.010> 13-inch<00:01:50.520> MacBook<00:01:50.700> Pro<00:01:51.150> had

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
than that the 13-inch MacBook Pro had

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.050 
than that the 13-inch MacBook Pro had
about<00:01:51.990> 33<00:01:52.619> minutes<00:01:52.950> left<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.250> rendering<00:01:53.580> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
about 33 minutes left in rendering so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
about 33 minutes left in rendering so
it's<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.300> surprising<00:01:54.530> even<00:01:55.530> though<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's not surprising even though the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's not surprising even though the
MacBook<00:01:56.430> Pro<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> Left<00:01:56.940> had<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> solid

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
MacBook Pro on the Left had a solid

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
Pro at a 5400 rpm drive so the last test
we're<00:02:02.130> going<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.280> be<00:02:02.369> doing<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> little<00:02:02.970> bit

iMovie<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.130> we're<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> be<00:02:11.520> converting

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
iMovie and we're going to be converting

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.870 
iMovie and we're going to be converting
it<00:02:12.030> from<00:02:12.360> dot<00:02:12.630> move<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.650> dot<00:02:13.830> avi<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.730> you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
it from dot move to dot avi and as you

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880 
it from dot move to dot avi and as you
may<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.209> they<00:02:15.450> are<00:02:15.630> very<00:02:15.660> computer<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.709> very

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
may know they are very computer and very

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 
may know they are very computer and very
process<00:02:17.400> or<00:02:17.489> heavy<00:02:17.670> files<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.720> we're<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.200> be

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
process or heavy files so we're gonna be

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650 
process or heavy files so we're gonna be
comparing<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:20.130> one<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.610> convert<00:02:21.209> faster

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
comparing which one can convert faster

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.699 
comparing which one can convert faster
and<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.870> course<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.230> going<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and of course it's going to be the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
and of course it's going to be the
15-inch<00:02:23.070> MacBook<00:02:23.190> Pro<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:23.850> it's<00:02:23.970> got

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
15-inch MacBook Pro because it's got

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.150 
15-inch MacBook Pro because it's got
better<00:02:24.330> graphics<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> better<00:02:25.080> CPU<00:02:25.560> we're

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
better graphics and a better CPU we're

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.890 
better graphics and a better CPU we're
just<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.580> about<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:27.030> much<00:02:27.239> faster<00:02:27.450> can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
just gonna see about how much faster can

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.940 
just gonna see about how much faster can
go<00:02:28.470> ahead<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.950> process<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:30.620> now<00:02:31.620> again<00:02:31.830> this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
go ahead and process that now again this

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.020 
go ahead and process that now again this
is<00:02:32.100> probably<00:02:32.250> sounding<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> little<00:02:32.940> bit

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
is probably sounding a little bit

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
is probably sounding a little bit
repetitive<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.050> 15-inch<00:02:34.380> MacBook<00:02:34.500> Pro

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
repetitive but the 15-inch MacBook Pro

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.199 
repetitive but the 15-inch MacBook Pro

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.789 
whereas the 15-inch MacBook Pro
completely<00:02:42.390> finished<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.019> that's<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.709> my
