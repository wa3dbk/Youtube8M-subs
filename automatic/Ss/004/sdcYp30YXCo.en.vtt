holiday<00:00:41.309> type<00:00:41.790> dragon<00:00:43.760> now<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:46.190> don't<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
holiday type dragon now I don't think it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
holiday type dragon now I don't think it
will<00:00:47.760> become<00:00:48.210> breathable<00:00:48.750> because<00:00:48.960> if

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
will become breathable because if

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
will become breathable because if
they're<00:00:50.160> gonna<00:00:50.399> release<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.210> more<00:00:51.539> dragon

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they're gonna release like more dragon

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
they're gonna release like more dragon
based<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> same<00:00:52.739> elements<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.360> did

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
based on the same elements like they did

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.500 
based on the same elements like they did
before<00:00:55.039> they<00:00:56.039> would<00:00:56.250> release<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> other

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
before they would release like the other

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.910 
before they would release like the other
elements<00:00:58.170> let's<00:00:58.440> say<00:00:58.739> flame<00:00:59.370> type<00:01:00.260> C<00:01:01.260> type<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
elements let's say flame type C type and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
elements let's say flame type C type and
so<00:01:02.190> forth<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.239> only<00:01:03.390> released<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so forth but they only released this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
so forth but they only released this
piece<00:01:04.710> dragon<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
piece dragon on on top of that as a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
piece dragon on on top of that as a
release<00:01:07.470> based<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.979> an<00:01:08.189> event<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> its

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
release based on an event and its

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
release based on an event and its
release<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.689> guess<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.840> named<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
release because I guess they named it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
release because I guess they named it
the<00:01:13.770> Piedra<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.760> basically<00:01:14.850> says

go into a shop and then we're gonna
check<00:02:01.710> out<00:02:01.920> see<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> dragon<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.840> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
if you you can't look at it and now

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.399

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
we're gonna level it to the adult form

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.250 
we're gonna level it to the adult form
and<00:03:52.970> here<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:56.209> absolutely<00:03:57.209> huge<00:03:57.689> look<00:03:58.140> at

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and here it is absolutely huge look at

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.280 
and here it is absolutely huge look at
its<00:03:58.379> claws<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.280> it<00:04:00.150> plants<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.659> tree<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.170> it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
its claws and it plants the tree and it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.369 
its claws and it plants the tree and it
grows<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:02.069> onto<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.519> ground<00:04:03.109> very<00:04:04.109> I<00:04:04.260> guess

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
grows right onto the ground very I guess

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.789 
grows right onto the ground very I guess
that<00:04:04.769> is<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.250> one<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.609> those<00:04:05.760> are<00:04:06.799> special

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
that is that one of those are special

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.940 
that is that one of those are special
trees<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.970> guess<00:04:09.299> I<00:04:09.510> mean<00:04:09.689> if<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.319> on<00:04:10.590> its

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
trees I guess I mean if it's on its

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.319 
trees I guess I mean if it's on its
mouth<00:04:11.159> and<00:04:11.430> then<00:04:11.519> once<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.819> put<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
mouth and then once you put it on the

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.939 
mouth and then once you put it on the
ground<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.930> grows<00:04:13.170> well<00:04:15.650> anyways<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.919> is

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
ground it grows well anyways that is

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.610 
ground it grows well anyways that is
about<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.699> that<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.479> piece<00:04:18.810> dragon<00:04:19.440> in

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
about it that is the piece dragon in

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.180 
about it that is the piece dragon in
dragon<00:04:20.370> City<00:04:20.989> if<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.590> haven't<00:04:22.889> gotten<00:04:23.039> the
