00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.779
 Now let's take a look at how to use the code and change the South 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:12.330
 This is easy. 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:16.650
 I saved the score and I asked for it, 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 I would like to change only a man's woman key. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.660
 Basically, we said we started the four keys . 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.190
 I'm talking. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.560
 Now let's illustrate a single original two lots will 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:35.129
 It's not a basketball game . 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.789
 Bit lower so I like to call the eldest man to raise a little girl Key word 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:45.510
 The keys are too low and then you raise them 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:48.900
 1 2 3 4 This is the color bar . 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.990
 A new record 1 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.940
 It would be like this. 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:02.010
 So when I do this I get the code a minor 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:07.830
 2 You have to come up with the place that was the opening note. 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.490
 If you are a minor, you should come up with me. 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.470
 I will. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.000
 It 's the capo's way of using it until it's open. 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:24.330
 CAP is a Protestant part corresponding to gaebanghyeon when holding me on the forehead 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.900
 Eunikka it came up as a key Capone instead of the place where the open 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.900
 You do it. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 Do you understand? 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:43.229
 So when I think about it now , I think that 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.530
 Then , just in sequence 1 2 3 4 I come up with the key I want 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.530
 You move in and you get seated. 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.409
 Let 's take a look . 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:06.920
 I used to just such a white horse What Da Capo 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:11.140
 To me you a fei 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.140
 Aulani 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 The man called it. If the woman wants to call it, he has to go straight up. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.600
 So the code is a minor code and so 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.080
 In the open 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.080
 I use CAP to put it up with the key I want 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:39.550
 Is this because I'm a woman now, what key portrait tagona fire day um um ah ha ah 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:46.660
 Monserrillas 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:51.640
 Oh well, save it Oh 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 The key of the male key is used as it is without changing the key of the code, 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 There is no way to change
