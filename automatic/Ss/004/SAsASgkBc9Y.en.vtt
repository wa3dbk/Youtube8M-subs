00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 this topic is about safety 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.960
 young family relaxed around 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.549
 no wonder one is also painless 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.389
 as we humans our offspring am 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.850
 best protect 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.449
 the adac tests this every year 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.180
 his child seat test this year with 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.670
 even higher requirements were 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.220
 Frontal impact revised a new one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.349
 page construction method developed and on 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 a new one was used 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.210
 the so-called q 10 that is one 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 ten-year-old child 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.200
 this new dummy offers more 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.450
 Measuring options that means one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.070
 the injury risks can be better 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 rate because you just read more 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.050
 gets and also from the movement process ago 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.149
 then this is closer to the people than 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 the predecessor 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 A total of 23 child seat models 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.440
 from all weight classes in the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.629
 Criteria Safety Operation Ergonomics 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 and pollutant tested that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.220
 test result is pleasing there are good 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 child seats for children of all ages 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.119
 In total we were able to do that 14 times 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
 good judgment 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.159
 However, three models fail at the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.049
 pollutant test and one is in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.570
 safety check failed so 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.540
 failed the hauck vario guard on 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.240
 frontal crash test and received the adac 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 judgment inadequate 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.799
 as well as polluted 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 models peugeot place without fixes as well 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.500
 the simple parenting you fool with and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.600
 without isofixbasis when buying the should 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.729
 necessarily in your own car and with 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 to try your own child 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 but fitting and good 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.090
 ratings are not everything for the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.710
 Unfortunately it is not enough for parents 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.560
 that you have a good child seat 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 buys and with that the matter is settled 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.350
 It is also important that these groups 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.840
 Child seat really neat 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.040
 built-in that you fasten the child well 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 that is, it must or must be close to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.790
 body just so can also one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.300
 good child seat the child at one 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.510
 well protect accident 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.760
 Well, it's much better 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.760
 even if you are painless
