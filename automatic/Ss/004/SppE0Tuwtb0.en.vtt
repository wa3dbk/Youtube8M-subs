00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.710
 heading is everybody hello how 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.519
 Often you offered to take pictures 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 is free 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.000
 we each have our own position on this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.790
 the subject 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 but I really like the attitude 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.260
 American and European colleagues 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.960
 who say so business is business 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.960
 we all make money anyway 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.060
 so especially for you today I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 found several stories that are visual 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 demonstrate to large companies 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.489
 tried to avoid pay for work 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 photographer photographer robert jones working 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.070
 with one rather large company 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.350
 construction 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 which has been famous for its way up 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 excessive requirements for freelancers and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 to his employees faced by the fact that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 having arrived at the location where he should have been 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 they literally tried to shoot the engineers 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 slip 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.270
 two more people besides those who were 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.340
 scheduled on schedule he did not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.039
 make a scandal did not embarrass 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.690
 people who came to him 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.090
 take a picture he took off and then 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 told the project manager what it is worth 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.960
 pay extra for recycling started 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.290
 literally scandal 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.840
 it is outrage and indignation but master 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.450
 stood his ground and eventually got 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.060
 their money because no one 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 said he would have to take more pictures 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.520
 two people it is very important it is very 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.340
 instructive please be careful 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.409

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 call from one agency intermediary 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.570
 he was told that there is a very big such 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.960
 task photo shoot for a large company and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.180
 should come to the office to discuss the details 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 he comes to him they say that the contract is still 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.920
 not signed and worth doing yet 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750
 some test shots like this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.920

 maybe good but for them maybe 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.260

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.320
