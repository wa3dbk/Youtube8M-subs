00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.010 
to look out for I might have just bought
a<00:04:42.200> faulty<00:04:42.740> one<00:04:42.920> or<00:04:43.130> something<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:44.990> know

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
a faulty one or something but you know

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.100 
a faulty one or something but you know
just<00:04:46.180> hopefully<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.330> doesn't<00:04:47.540> happen<00:04:47.810> to

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
just hopefully that doesn't happen to

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.640 
just hopefully that doesn't happen to
you<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.320> guess<00:04:48.680> so<00:04:49.640> as<00:04:50.210> we<00:04:50.540> move<00:04:50.750> up<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> tail<00:04:51.380> is

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
you I guess so as we move up the tail is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.010 
you I guess so as we move up the tail is
very<00:04:51.710> nice<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.370> long<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:52.730> think<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.690> makes

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
very nice and long I think it it makes

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.380 
very nice and long I think it it makes
it<00:04:54.320> it's<00:04:54.560> very<00:04:54.800> nice<00:04:55.070> I<00:04:55.370> like<00:04:55.730> the<00:04:55.910> stands<00:04:56.240> that

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
it it's very nice I like the stands that

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.440 
it it's very nice I like the stands that
she's<00:04:56.780> in<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:58.220> could<00:04:58.430> pick<00:04:58.669> this<00:04:59.000> figure

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
she's in you could pick this figure

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.920 
she's in you could pick this figure

how it's priced over here might be

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.120 
how it's priced over here might be
different<00:05:05.780> from<00:05:05.990> wherever<00:05:06.260> you're<00:05:06.590> from<00:05:06.650> in

different from wherever you're from in

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.170 
different from wherever you're from in
the<00:05:07.190> world<00:05:08.169> but<00:05:09.169> overall<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:10.190> would<00:05:10.400> give<00:05:10.940> this

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
the world but overall I would give this

blue<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.890> think<00:05:19.220> is<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.490> very<00:05:19.970> viable<00:05:20.810> figure

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
blue but I think is a very viable figure

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.150 
blue but I think is a very viable figure
