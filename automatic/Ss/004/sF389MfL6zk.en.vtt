00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.189
 My name is Enrique Rojo I am a professor of psychiatry por ciento y madrid 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.770
 but to present you my book that ends up apparently 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.539
 to days in prison is a manual on this serious illness 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.630
 which is the evening of the sadness of melancholy as it is considered 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.109
 which is a very common fair we know that all ages will be 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.720
 l appears in children in her through more expensive expressions 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.259
 the child stops playing a school failure 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.949
 the xiria mustio even as very close to what would be 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.790
 foot washes autism 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.500
 and then depression occurs in all ages 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 approximately two to three times more frequent in women 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 i percent also appears in the third and then we find that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.780
 the depressions at this time to change their landscape 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.790
 there 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 a very small therapeutical very large of vido to the great advances of 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.420
 I saw 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.010
 in recent years 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 it is a steely castle always 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.430
 we can think that is a recent citation 20 40 years old is not 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.920
 A) Yes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 there are decisions 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.520
 in the ancient concepts extinctions in the two cultures 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.700
 most important fluvial 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.870
 in the world that are fundamentally 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.920
 frost 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 refers to the Tigris and Euphrates and that of the Nile in Egypt Villaluz and two of the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.730
 dead for example with those who s 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.110
 percent 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.880
 they did not get from the tombs of the pharaohs there are melancholy distinctions 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.490
 How many types of fish can we ask? 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.230
 there are two types of pressures 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.230
 exogenous depressions and decisions hundred 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.690
 the former former queens as Soviet come from outside are due to 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 life events of fifth great events 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.020
 the small things added in a negative way would call Castro the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.320
 microtraumas 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.030
 if it can be more economical psychological problems 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.070
 ed valentine and not with oneself 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420
 I understand that lots of others are added by the macro trauma impacts 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 emotional 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.989
 remains place 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.839
 in court in the cross of life 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.709
 exogenous depressions 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.459
 so they come from outside 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.089
 they have worse prognosis paradoxically because you are not easy to solve 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 the problem that lies within them 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.129
 the endogenous depressions on the contrary 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.530
 they come from within that 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.539
 say they are 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539
 unmotivated are due to nothing 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.219
 doctor I'm sad but without there being any 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.559
 event that has not produced 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.859
 those expressions that are of logical biochemical nature that in a background 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.939
 hereditary adherence seriously serious about all female own 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.430
 and here and five obligations transcendent costs many advances we know how 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.499
 this one occurs 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:56.309
 the chosen book haakon will turn off public decide adopts an immense 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.339
 most people here all over the world 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.129
 the choral prize was going to be a colloquial language that could be 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.699
 access although well some references 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.869
 in footnotes comas technicality with rivero has admitted 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.559
 There are people who are interested in the subject 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.099
 to people who ask themselves many times that I am this from the pressure now 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.179
 unbelievers who may think that depression is an invention 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:18.959
 of the ediles the people 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.789
 while if you want to rotate 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.939
 and on the other hand I think that it is a good way also for relatives of 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:26.689
 people 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 close who may have had little prison sentence 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.219
 it's interesting for example the chapter on the history of depression namely 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.049
 the Depression 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.769
 that a disease that as I said before 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.849
 It has a long tradition 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.039
 min the reader company can dive in that I'll see what 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:46.879
 that there are decisions for example the first decision that is to yield to 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.619
 prison 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:48.610
 bipolar 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.610
 say the upward and downward mood changes 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.590
 They are written by a doctor of Fernando 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.969
 7th called piquÃ© arrufat that describes the depression of the king 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:00.629
 believe that I will call them 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.469
 psychosis maniac depressive 19 20 and that we currently carry depression 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.189
 bipolar 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.510
 what the book brings 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.619
 in the weighing of current psychology and another of the book 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.859
 it is a vision 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.619
 pretty neat 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.499
 The eclectic day 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.669
 and criticism is a word that means that this part mix of gathering of 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:19.599
 shadow 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.300
 different aspects 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 consider depression as something 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:32.679
 as a way of thinking there is a very interesting chapter that is the 

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:33.939
 person and aggressive 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.759
 the day you are healthy you have depression 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.870
 but they are price the dike 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.770
 the network the clarity of them 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.860
 it was within that context this way of being pessimistic 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.960
 negative 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.550
 a skewed view 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.939
 in December 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.340
 dn the negative of oneself and that thrown in the face 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.659
 my specialty 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.779
 the topic on which I have worked the most 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:05:00.399
 this time that this book is raised this sum and summarize the result jacinta 

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.990
 isis 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.360
 of many aspects and nuances of my life 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.449
 of personal work of many years carrying in that sense is a book 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.939
 I think it's the interest 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.629
 that the seal of the author the network the signature of the house we can say 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.930
 there a lot of matter knowledge think about you 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.930
 g percent the knowledge of their learned 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.759
 yesterday depression in search of the reasonable price a practical guide for 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.919
 enter 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:27.139
 in this jungle 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.599
 exciting of the depressive world 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.209
 thank you
