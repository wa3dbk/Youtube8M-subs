00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.970
 this has allowed us to program the air conditioning of the area in which 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.050
 find 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.690
 you can make independent schedules for each day of the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.620
 week 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.060
 specific schedules for weekdays and weekends 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 schedules that cover every day of the week 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.580
 in each day a group of days have three programs the goal is 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.570
 get maximum comfort and energy savings in this way the installation 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 it will only work in the time slot of the programming made 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.380
 to carry out the programs that you want to decide the steps that are explained to 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.470
 continuation 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.540
 to start it is necessary to adjust the touch thermostat time 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.290
 in case the thermostat is in Moscow with the time without 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.659
 adjust puricelli I know 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.339
 this relationship is that stamp paying until the day of the week on track 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.519
 to change 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.090
 use the adjustment arrows to set the day of the week 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.429
 and I confirmed what with a pulsation girl are 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:25.899
 then use the adjustment arrows to set the time and confirm the 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:30.059
 with an English pulsation tony repeat the same procedure for 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.059
 Carlos minutes 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.029
 Once the previous adjustments are completed, we proceed to make two examples 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.829
 simple programming 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.959
 with the thermostat Sunday performs a pulse in Spain 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.180
 then the clock icon in the upper left corner to activate the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.049
 selection of the day of the week 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.879
 the adjustment arrows select the working days of the week that we are going 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.069
 to schedule I confirmed pressing in estonia 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.259
 the icon of the clock and the icon but one will start to flash as the icon sets 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:04.099
 put 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.469
 with the adjustment arrows set the start time of the program at six o'clock and 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.899
 average in this particular case 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.399
 I confirmed by pressing in the mud 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:17.979
 set the minutes in the same way and firmly again by pressing mesons to the 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.909
 validate the start time and minutes of the program will begin to blink the 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.109
 gisela temperature gauge with the adjustment arrows to twenty-one degrees by 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.289
 example to confirm tulsa and stone after validating the temperature is 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.959
 will activate the end of program icon with the adjustment arrows choose the time of 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.070
 the minutes of the end of the program 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.250
 in this example we put as final hour eight o'clock in the morning 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 validate by clicking in Spain 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.819
 and more if we perform the second scenario of programming 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.409
 it's about the pop rock icon 2 to start the program again 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.569
 that act 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.539
 with the adjustment dates set the start time at three thirty and with firm 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.409
 well before an exam 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.409
 set the minutes and the line in the same way 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.460
 Set the temperature 23 degrees in this case and confirm by pressing in Spain 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 figel now defends eleven thirty program for example confirming with a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 pulsation in Spain 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.559
 to leave the time programming menu I put new Spain 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.750
 next we are going to make an example of end time programming 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:54.410
 week with the world thermostat I made a pulsation and unstable 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.130
 then the clock icon in the upper left corner to activate the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.279
 selection of the day of the week 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.779
 with the adjustment arrows select the days that correspond to the weekend 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.509
 I mean, yes 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
 7 confirm as an inevitable pulsation 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.879
 the clock icon and the deep icon will start blinking 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.129
 because the congo icon with the adjustment arrows set the start time of the 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.119
 program 9 for example and continued to push the story 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.080
 When validating the start time of the program, it will start at 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.509
 blink the temperature indicator 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.750
 gisela with the adjustment arrows to 23 degrees in this case 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.689
 to confirm I pressed new Spain 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.080
 spec of validating the temperature will activate the end icon of the program 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.160
 with the adjustment arrows choose the hour and two minutes from the end of the program in 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.229
 this example we put like the end the twelve and a half validate by pressing in arizona 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.960
 lima if we perform the second weekend programming scenario 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.869
 about the pro points icon to start the program again 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.879
 you like 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.919
 with the adjustment arrows set the start time at 4 o'clock 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.240
 and confirm by pressing on exams 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.270
 set the minutes invalidates in the same way 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:19.889
 and that the temperature of 23 degrees in this case and with firm because santana made 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:20.839
 boy 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.669
 figel now defines the eleven thirty program in this example confirming with 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.669
 an ine pulsation 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.860
 to leave the time schedule menu again in this nor a 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.099
 Once the desired time schedules have been made, we activate them 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.240
 click on the icon airzone select the automatic mode set 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.279
 When the selected time arrives they will activate each one of the 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.469
 programming 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.709
 I have to deactivate the settings made for example 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:02.159
 during holidays for holiday periods just press the icon 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.309
 hand as the icon to pay the thermostat completely 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.099
 we expect it to be effective October to the time schedules 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:12.620
 reduced 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.990
 to continue expanding knowledge about programming 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.990
 more advanced as it was in the programs created 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.539
 Oscar the rest of our lives through our 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:23.830
 Web page
