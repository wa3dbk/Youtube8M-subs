00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.930
 hurry is normally bad 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.550
 counselor when it comes to 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.440
 video games and there was therefore some 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.450
 fear of the actual quality of this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.710
 first to don especially if yes

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.750
 borderlands 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.460
 fortunately, however, we can tell you 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.870
 immediately that this pirate adventure 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.880
 it wasn't a hole in the water 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.230
 prepared roux meloncino there are a 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.680
 zillion of new weapons from 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.680
 plunder 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 I am shade and you are the most person 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.340

 please don't go 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.880
 the dlc will immediately add one 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.799
 additional visitable lease in the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.810
 game map once installed 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.759
 it is the city ​​of oasis an area 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.710
 desert invaded by pirates of the sands 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.830
 as you will find a strange hunter look-alike 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.479
 thompson named shade eliminated first 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.159
 opponents your new friend vi 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.110
 will offer some simple missions and vi 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.670
 will give his new mobile sand 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.490
 vehicle later obtainable through 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.720
 hunts ride this hovercraft ship is the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.940
 first strength of the new 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.770
 faster and stronger expansion 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.690
 manageable of every other four wheels 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.340
 at your disposal makes it much more 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.440
 nice to wander for extended maps e 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.360
 fight against other vehicles 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.520
 it is a very positive thing since the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.200
 box provided the expansion based on 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.600
 not a little on the general's armory 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.369
 crocs and therefore we often find ourselves in 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.369
 territory to navigate on board of wind 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.609
 even the enemies have immediately re king 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 complete among the antagonists you will find 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.510
 pirates of various types accompanied by 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.690
 huge beasts they didn't replace 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.190
 goliath and a handful of fearsome bosses 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.170
 indeed the changes here are 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.359
 mainly stylistic and enemies 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.890
 turn out to be enhanced variants of the 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.320
 bandits found in the base game 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.329
 never mind the difficulty remains high 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.489
 throughout the campaign and combat 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.750
 has not lost spectacularity launcher 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.549
 not all, however, in this cheerful 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.079
 the package works wonders 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.910
 in fact these are numerous but 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.799
 rather repetitive and both those 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.450
 primary and secondary ones are based 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.340
 all too much about finding certain ones 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.959
 objects some environmental puzzles 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.209
 related to the discovery of treasures 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.069
 hidden break the monotony 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.180
 but borderlands gameplay is not enough 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.190
 2 still manages to maintain 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.109
 the exhilarating experience from the beginning to the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.850
 end can not arrive from not more 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.500
 she would be sorry after all 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.030
 developers have shown more more 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.769
 times of having ideas galore 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.040
 the element that most of all remained at 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.230
 top is undoubtedly in him 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.150
 the weapons are once again so many 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.829
 and there is no lack of truly heavenly women 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.319
 for those who always love to collect baubles 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.849
 even more devastating in the game 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.920
 inserted a new level of reality has 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.019
 called evening obtainable by a seller 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.280
 of oasis by hydro pali crystals from 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.159
 some of your special difficulties 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.599
 very high these weapons seem 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.609
 apparently inferior to the usual ones 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:27.659
 legendary but can upgrade to 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:32.579
 leads to eliminating specific opponents 3 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.900
 absolute place to destroy it abu 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.909
 rahme too moving to the compartment 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.409
 technical dlc offers some of the 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.250
 most beautiful occasions seen so far in 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.439
 borderlands 2 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.359
 the setting quickly passes by 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.650
 tropical desert or I take often 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.239
 breathtaking views 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.919
 even the enemies are cooler and 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.930
 pleasant to the sight of normal ones 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.909
 not to mention that so many of the new ones 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.280
 weapons have a lot of pirated lucrates 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.970
 apt always worthy dialogues 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.530
 fun 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.870
 crazy and full of humor 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.000
 the characters once again sharp 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.500
 they are well characterized and you will have fun 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.780
 a lot to listen to speeches by 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.459
 careless scarlett carter mixed between one 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.440
 naive girl is a proud head 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.579
 completely devoid of morality but that is 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.129
 I'm not even rude 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.329
 neither presented nor often apologized are 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.329
 scarone captain 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.220
 more than finally worthy of longevity there 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.259
 it will take more than a few hours to complete 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.910
 all these offers from the lc without 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.259
 count the new bosses and extra zones 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.389
 think about making me mad and 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.919
 desperate cat and scarlett to say 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.810
 sputi is a dlc full of goodies 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.970
 content that has nothing to envy 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.800
 to those created for the first borderline 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.539
 one could perhaps make an effort 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.370
 additional to increase the variety of 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.259
 these enemies but the gearbox guys 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.759
 still managed to churn out a 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.630
 high quality product in a very short time 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:46.979
 time 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.870
 if they plan to grow up 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:57.289
 from here on, expect great things 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:57.289
 from the next expansion it will fare
