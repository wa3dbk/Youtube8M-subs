00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
sprite sheets now sprite sheets are a

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.999 
sprite sheets now sprite sheets are a
great<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> get<00:00:13.230> optimal<00:00:13.769> performance

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
great way to get optimal performance

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.160 
great way to get optimal performance
whether<00:00:14.580> you're<00:00:14.759> making<00:00:14.880> say<00:00:15.240> animation<00:00:15.839> or

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
whether you're making say animation or

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
whether you're making say animation or
creating<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.710> game<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.550> used<00:00:17.970> quite<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> bit

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
creating a game it's used quite a bit

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
creating a game it's used quite a bit
and<00:00:18.690> what's<00:00:18.869> great<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.619> go<00:00:19.650> ahead<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and what's great is I can go ahead and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
and what's great is I can go ahead and
use<00:00:20.189> something<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.609> flash<00:00:21.119> professional<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
use something like flash professional to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
use something like flash professional to
generate<00:00:22.740> these<00:00:22.980> sprite<00:00:23.580> sheets<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.390> this

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
generate these sprite sheets to get this

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
generate these sprite sheets to get this
sort<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> optimal<00:00:25.470> performance<00:00:25.710> which<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
sort of optimal performance which is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
sort of optimal performance which is
awesome<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:27.269> let's<00:00:27.420> go<00:00:27.539> ahead<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
awesome so let's go ahead and take a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.740 
awesome so let's go ahead and take a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
this animation that I've worked hard on

and I want to go ahead and generate a
sprite<00:00:50.309> sheet<00:00:50.610> from<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.960> take<00:00:52.140> any

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
sprite sheet from it so I can take any

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.040 
sprite sheet from it so I can take any
asset<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:53.760> library<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.570> click<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
asset in my library right click on it

asset in my library right click on it
and<00:00:55.640> generate<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.910> sprite<00:00:57.510> sheet<00:00:57.840> from<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and generate a sprite sheet from that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
and generate a sprite sheet from that
asset<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.640> actually<00:00:59.850> even<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.260> know

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
asset I can actually even take you know

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.650 
asset I can actually even take you know
multiple<00:01:01.859> assets<00:01:02.309> select<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
multiple assets select them all at the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.080 
multiple assets select them all at the
same<00:01:03.840> time<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.470> output<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.369> sprite<00:01:05.790> sheet

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
same time and output one sprite sheet

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
same time and output one sprite sheet
with<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> let's<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.189> ahead

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
with them all on it so let's go ahead

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
with them all on it so let's go ahead
and<00:01:08.369> see<00:01:08.460> what<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.760> looks<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.030> generate

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and see what this looks like generate

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
and see what this looks like generate
sprite<00:01:10.350> sheet<00:01:12.890> here<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.060> my

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
sprite sheet here it is we can see my

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
sprite sheet here it is we can see my
swim<00:01:15.509> dog<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.140> quickly<00:01:16.470> preview<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.159> looks

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
swim dog I can quickly preview it looks

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.359 
swim dog I can quickly preview it looks
good<00:01:18.200> clicking<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:19.680> sprite<00:01:20.070> sheet

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
good clicking back to my sprite sheet

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789 
good clicking back to my sprite sheet
you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> different<00:01:22.320> motion<00:01:22.650> going

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
you can see the different motion going

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
you can see the different motion going
on<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> things<00:01:24.960> you're

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
on in here and two of the things you're

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
on in here and two of the things you're
probably<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> want<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.460> trim<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
probably going to want to do is trim it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.230 
probably going to want to do is trim it
up<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.689> select<00:01:28.080> trim<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:29.280> stack<00:01:29.820> any

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
up so select trim and then stack any

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
up so select trim and then stack any
duplicate<00:01:31.110> frames<00:01:31.500> okay<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> trim

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
duplicate frames okay so when you trim

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.399 
duplicate frames okay so when you trim
it<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.360> ultimately<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it up it's ultimately going to mean a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.230 
it up it's ultimately going to mean a
smaller<00:01:34.920> file<00:01:35.250> size<00:01:35.549> especially<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
smaller file size especially if you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679 
smaller file size especially if you
stack<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.409> well<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.850> probably<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
stack it as well but probably the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
stack it as well but probably the
biggest<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.590> most<00:01:40.619> important<00:01:41.340> thing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
biggest or most important thing

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.480 
biggest or most important thing
available<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.299> here<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.079> data<00:01:43.320> format<00:01:43.979> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
available in here is the data format so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
available in here is the data format so
if<00:01:44.759> you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.149> ahead<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> output

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
if you're going to go ahead and output

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.679 
if you're going to go ahead and output
this<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.950> maybe<00:01:47.460> use<00:01:47.700> back<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.119> flash<00:01:48.360> may<00:01:48.630> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
this to maybe use back and flash may be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
this to maybe use back and flash may be
going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> use<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> Starling<00:01:49.829> framework

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
going to use the Starling framework

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.630 
going to use the Starling framework
that's<00:01:51.090> using<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.259> flash<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.890> flash

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that's using a you know flash and flash

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's using a you know flash and flash
the<00:01:54.030> flash<00:01:54.210> platform<00:01:54.720> or<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.439> even

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the flash platform or you can even

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
the flash platform or you can even
output<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.430> easeljs<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.659> not

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
output this for easeljs so you can not

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.539 
output this for easeljs so you can not
only<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.649> flash<00:01:58.890> content<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.520> also

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
only use this in flash content but also

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.490 
only use this in flash content but also
HTML<00:02:00.270> content<00:02:00.509> including<00:02:01.140> some<00:02:01.320> other

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
one of those graphics the big thing I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.170 
one of those graphics the big thing I
need<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.250> note<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.610> fact<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.000> i'm<00:03:10.150> just

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
need to note is the fact that i'm just

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.900 
need to note is the fact that i'm just
going<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.780> refer<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.140> swim<00:03:11.920> dog<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.610> case

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
going to refer to swim dog in this case

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.570 
going to refer to swim dog in this case
okay<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.049> easy<00:03:14.260> if<00:03:14.530> i<00:03:14.650> jump<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
okay it's that easy if i jump to the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.580 
okay it's that easy if i jump to the
HTML<00:03:16.269> page<00:03:16.510> where<00:03:16.810> i'm<00:03:16.900> going<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.080> use<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.410> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
HTML page where i'm going to use it and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.009 
HTML page where i'm going to use it and
you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.370> see<00:03:18.549> right<00:03:18.579> down<00:03:18.790> here<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:19.840> is

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
you can see right down here this is

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.289 
you can see right down here this is
where<00:03:20.200> i<00:03:20.260> am<00:03:20.380> instantiating<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.400> new<00:03:21.609> swim<00:03:22.060> dog

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
where i am instantiating a new swim dog

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.440 
where i am instantiating a new swim dog
called<00:03:22.780> my<00:03:23.079> swim<00:03:23.739> dog<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.280> then<00:03:24.820> i'm<00:03:24.970> giving

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
called my swim dog and then i'm giving

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.640 
called my swim dog and then i'm giving
it<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.660> position<00:03:26.109> which<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.410> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.590> be

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it a position which is going to be

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.740 
it a position which is going to be
random<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.459> case<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.180> placing<00:03:28.660> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
random in this case and then placing it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.580 
random in this case and then placing it
on<00:03:28.959> this<00:03:29.230> stage<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.829> fact<00:03:30.519> what<00:03:30.760> i<00:03:30.790> can<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.480> i

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
on this stage in fact what i can do is i

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.160 
on this stage in fact what i can do is i
just<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.920> for<00:03:33.430> loop<00:03:33.670> as<00:03:33.880> well<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:34.660> we're

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
just have this for loop as well so we're

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.110 
just have this for loop as well so we're
going<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.380> take<00:03:35.560> this<00:03:35.769> from<00:03:36.100> one<00:03:36.489> dog<00:03:36.730> being

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
going to take this from one dog being

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.949 
going to take this from one dog being
generated<00:03:37.720> in<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.650> random<00:03:39.100> position<00:03:39.940> 250<00:03:40.780> is

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
generated in a random position 250 is

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.460 
generated in a random position 250 is
the<00:03:41.380> idea<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.850> with<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.450> all<00:03:43.660> squared<00:03:44.019> away<00:03:44.079> i

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
the idea so with that all squared away i

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.099 
the idea so with that all squared away i
can<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.370> ahead<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.730> preview<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:46.900> a

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
can go ahead and preview this in a

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.690 
can go ahead and preview this in a
browser

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.570 

and<00:03:54.140> there<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.290> can<00:03:55.319> see<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.920> of<00:03:55.980> those<00:03:56.280> dogs

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
and there you can see all of those dogs

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.360 
and there you can see all of those dogs
swimming<00:03:57.060> around<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.560> hit<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:58.950> refresh

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
swimming around and if I hit the refresh

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.580 
swimming around and if I hit the refresh
button<00:03:59.400> you<00:04:00.090> can<00:04:00.209> see<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.599> again<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.260> there's

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
button you can see it again this there's

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.380 
button you can see it again this there's
50<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.129> them<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.549> all<00:04:02.730> referring<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.269> that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
50 of them here all referring to that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.089 
50 of them here all referring to that
one<00:04:03.599> sprite<00:04:03.930> sheet<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.500> can<00:04:04.530> see<00:04:04.799> how<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:04.950> can

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
one sprite sheet you can see how I can

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.280 
one sprite sheet you can see how I can
easily<00:04:05.430> use<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:06.030> okay<00:04:06.629> so<00:04:06.690> that's<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.260> example

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
easily use it okay so that's one example

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.880 
easily use it okay so that's one example
in<00:04:08.209> HTML<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:10.019> again<00:04:10.319> turn<00:04:10.739> around

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
in HTML but you can again turn around

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.180 
in HTML but you can again turn around
and<00:04:11.340> use<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.120> Starling<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.409> this<00:04:13.890> file

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and use that in Starling so this file

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.310 
and use that in Starling so this file
actually<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.909> using<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.569> Starling<00:04:16.199> now

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
actually is using it in Starling now

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.890 
actually is using it in Starling now
this<00:04:16.470> isn't<00:04:16.650> going<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.250> turn<00:04:17.459> into<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.750> know

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
this isn't going to turn into a you know

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.129 
this isn't going to turn into a you know
a<00:04:19.169> whole<00:04:20.010> explanation<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.820> Starling<00:04:21.449> but<00:04:21.930> know

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
a whole explanation of Starling but know

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.620 
a whole explanation of Starling but know
that<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.560> go<00:04:22.710> ahead<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.010> use<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:24.180> Starling

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
that I can go ahead and use the Starling

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.500 
that I can go ahead and use the Starling
framework<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.380> generate<00:04:26.190> roughly<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:27.330> same

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
framework and generate roughly the same

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.879 
framework and generate roughly the same
thing<00:04:27.810> where<00:04:27.960> we<00:04:28.050> have<00:04:28.139> this<00:04:28.289> one<00:04:28.470> dog<00:04:28.650> its

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
thing where we have this one dog its

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.590 
thing where we have this one dog its
kind<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.100> floating<00:04:29.520> through<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.120> water<00:04:30.330> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
kind of floating through the water and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.050 
kind of floating through the water and
you<00:04:30.990> can<00:04:31.139> see<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.500> performance<00:04:31.830> here<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.550> just

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
you can see the performance here is just

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.689 
you can see the performance here is just
exceptional<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.520> browser

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
exceptional and this is in the browser

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.250 
exceptional and this is in the browser
and<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.060> course<00:04:36.300> we're<00:04:36.449> working<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:36.990> for

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
and of course we're working on this for

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.230 
and of course we're working on this for
mobile<00:04:37.650> as<00:04:37.770> well<00:04:37.800> but<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.639> be<00:04:38.729> able<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:39.090> get

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
mobile as well but to be able to get

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.900 
mobile as well but to be able to get
this<00:04:39.419> sort<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.720> performance<00:04:40.340> using<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.610> sprite

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
this sort of performance using a sprite

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.180 
this sort of performance using a sprite
sheet<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.360> huge<00:04:42.930> because<00:04:43.289> it's<00:04:43.889> just<00:04:44.010> going<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
sheet is huge because it's just going to

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.189 
sheet is huge because it's just going to
allow<00:04:44.280> you<00:04:44.310> for<00:04:44.639> this<00:04:44.789> this<00:04:45.300> extra<00:04:45.720> layer<00:04:45.930> of

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
allow you for this this extra layer of

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.230 
allow you for this this extra layer of
creativity<00:04:46.949> that<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.280> can<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.789> can<00:04:48.060> do

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
creativity that you can that you can do

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.939 
creativity that you can that you can do
using<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.720> program<00:04:48.900> you're<00:04:49.199> familiar<00:04:49.350> with<00:04:49.590> and

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
using a program you're familiar with and

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.020 
using a program you're familiar with and
getting<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.550> performance<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.570> want<00:04:51.810> as<00:04:51.990> well
