00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.720
 Dear readers Dear readers inside a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.210
 funny body even if it is not all 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.280
 this is how the teachers and theirs feel 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.509
 union will settle 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.940
 briefly considered whether we mister neugebauer 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.650
 give the strap president on it 100 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.960
 open otherwise makes more fun have us 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 decided a lot of fun 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 next to me one of the authors holger 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 Krahmer schmidt next to the Christian 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 ZÃ¶chling was always there so the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.890
 girl addressed 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.370
 Of course there are no good teachers either 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.660
 but if I ask during the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.140
 have researched multiple times 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.940
 pronounced during research 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.820
 Your opinions rather impress 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.950
 solidifies that, for example, a 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.550
 large part of the teacher no longer 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.379
 work as the average of the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.590
 Carefully express population 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.239
 By no means it is not just at 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.070
 generally in public 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.410
 But above all with the teachers 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.239
 the change in society and in 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.570
 The world of work simply passes without a trace 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.420
 I'll go a few more now 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 terms on the table alpine daily 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.340
 lenzing there are industries media 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.659
 they break away 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.820
 the bulk of the private sector 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.460
 employed work well over 38 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.140
 hours a week and the teachers are not 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.790
 ready for these changes 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.130
 working more female 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.250
 employment just longer working hours 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.409
 to enter by also in the afternoon 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.590
 are in school and therefore for students 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.780
 and parents are tangible because of it 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.270
 that many reject us through phases 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.100
 it's a bit dated 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.200
 we seem to know there is none 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.240
 frontal lessons more we know it 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.630
 There is no pressure to learn Latin 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 Hundreds of runners so if plans 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.079
 the little ones of capital cities today 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 There are of course more shoulders 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.740
 is that now the union is that 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.990
 I do not believe the union 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.210
 Of course that's how you are again 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.039
 Nutrient looks like it's from politics 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.940
 you can also dictate that 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.040
 debate 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.050
 For example, I think that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.450
 one also about mathematics from the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:22.959
 sixth sixth grade debating 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 could and not just about Latin because it 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.730
 is what I'll ask later 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 brings unless I want to mathematics 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.620
 I study that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.110
 for example , someone who controls once 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.180
 a topic the question of frontal teaching 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
 or even work out, I believe 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.110
 also different from topic to topic 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.060
 I think I think that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.860
 sometimes too little frontal lessons 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.170
 the children are being made too much 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.280
 the things are stopped themselves 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.630
 to work out the biggest part in the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.400
 History I found that the teachers 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.140
 have specified during Holy Week 30 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.840
 to work for 30 hours 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.940
 in a representative survey by 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.330
 this survey they invoke 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.730
 insanely glad that was in 2001 from 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.680
 Ministry of Education a survey 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.170
 Commissioned by the teachers 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 at random were the teachers 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.799
 selected and the union is 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.890
 went along and has the per 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.549
 tracked down and them at the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.640
 fill in the questionnaires support 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.920
 has stood by their side and so has 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.350
 who looked out of it when the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.989
 work much more according to the survey 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.480
 as everyone else engaged in this 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.040
 republic 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.200
 we found has editorial meeting all 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.900
 the corker is the teacher surprising 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.209
 So that was immediately a 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.970
 seems to form a homogeneous mass 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.739
 and I have the impression, too 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.019
 if i give you the reader letter or the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.299
 angry calls accept 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.280
 that there is not something there first of all 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.100
 blocked and defended and not 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 differentiated the problem is that 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.819
 this impression also many directors 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.340
 with whom we have talked on the phone 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.439
 if they say even if we try 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.230
 have a bad teacher for reason 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.480
 it has suddenly got under way too 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.730
 the committed 1 1 a shoulder close 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.470
 formed because everyone was afraid that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.299
 that happens to them once or that one 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.500
 could also take action against him once 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.830
 that is of course counterproductive 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.030
 but it is so that the teacher 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.789
 have the unions in the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.020
 last 2000 years the right one 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.310
 made for the society that it 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.310
 maybe not the best 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.979
 Thank you for long pleasure with 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.979
