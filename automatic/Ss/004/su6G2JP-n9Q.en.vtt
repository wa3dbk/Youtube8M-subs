getting a lot of short hits I'll double
it<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> hook<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> times

that<00:00:46.320> strong<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> bottom<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.489> end<00:00:47.700> up

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that strong at the bottom so you end up

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.970 
that strong at the bottom so you end up
with<00:00:47.879> gray<00:00:48.090> coughs<00:00:48.420> anyway<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.320> only<00:00:49.770> do

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
with gray coughs anyway so I only do

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
with gray coughs anyway so I only do
that<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.309> need<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:52.579> I'll<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:53.820> when<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> put

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that when I need to I'll also when I put

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.209

of<00:01:31.320> skin<00:01:31.680> we're<00:01:32.610> fishing<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.270> lead<00:01:33.509> core

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
of skin we're fishing with lead core

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
of skin we're fishing with lead core
line<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:35.460> lead<00:01:35.700> core<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.299> have

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
line here with lead core we don't have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.380 
line here with lead core we don't have
any<00:01:36.570> weight<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.140> tube<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.530> worms<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.390> find

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
any weight on the tube and worms I find

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.859 
any weight on the tube and worms I find
that<00:01:39.509> lead<00:01:39.990> core<00:01:40.259> drops<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.920> evenly<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> your

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
that lead core drops more evenly so your

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
that lead core drops more evenly so your
tube<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> less<00:01:43.590> likely<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> caught<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.670> the

tube is less likely to be caught in the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.870 
tube is less likely to be caught in the

rocks and also if you do get caught

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
rocks and also if you do get caught
you're<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> little<00:01:48.600> better<00:01:48.840> position<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.409> get

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you're a little better position to get

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.270 
you're a little better position to get

I changed my line every three weeks
because<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> develops<00:02:00.750> weaknesses<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
because it develops weaknesses it's a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
because it develops weaknesses it's a
just<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.210> me<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.509> beautiful<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> be

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
beautiful places to go in a kayak

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
beautiful places to go in a kayak
you<00:02:14.360> don't<00:02:14.569> need<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> boat<00:02:15.350> launch<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:16.400> it's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
you don't need a boat launch you it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.240 
you don't need a boat launch you it's
not<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.910> big<00:02:17.180> expense<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.470> not<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.010> lot<00:02:19.190> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
not a big expense this is not a lot of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.000 
not a big expense this is not a lot of
gas<00:02:19.550> involved<00:02:20.270> yeah<00:02:21.050> don't<00:02:21.410> worry<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.800> gas

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
gas involved yeah don't worry about gas

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.670 
gas involved yeah don't worry about gas
you<00:02:22.760> provide<00:02:23.150> your<00:02:23.360> own<00:02:23.420> propulsion<00:02:23.930> got<00:02:24.530> like

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you provide your own propulsion got like

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.490 
you provide your own propulsion got like
bicycle<00:02:25.220> chains<00:02:25.520> just<00:02:26.360> flaps<00:02:26.720> back<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.230> forth

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
bicycle chains just flaps back and forth

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.520 
bicycle chains just flaps back and forth
like<00:02:27.770> seal<00:02:28.370> flippers<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.090> think<00:02:30.050> because<00:02:30.380> it's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
like seal flippers I think because it's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.380 
like seal flippers I think because it's
right<00:02:30.740> in<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.890> center<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> boat<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:32.240> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
right in the center of the boat that you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.260 
right in the center of the boat that you
get<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.260> better<00:02:33.560> linear<00:02:33.860> movement

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
get it you get a better linear movement

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.580 
get it you get a better linear movement
versus<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.300> paddle<00:02:35.840> where<00:02:36.020> you're<00:02:36.200> pushing

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
versus a paddle where you're pushing

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.320 
versus a paddle where you're pushing
farther<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.700> side<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.209> each

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
farther out to the side in each

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.780 
farther out to the side in each
direction<00:02:38.709> time<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.920> make<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.100> move<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
direction time to make a move to the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.760 
direction time to make a move to the
mouth<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.180> narrow<00:02:41.420> River<00:02:41.690> you're<00:02:42.350> going<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.680> go

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
mouth of narrow River you're going to go

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.310 
mouth of narrow River you're going to go
by<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.069> go<00:02:43.730> by<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:43.970> Coast<00:02:44.569> Guard<00:02:44.840> house<00:02:45.020> and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
by the go by the Coast Guard house and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.949 
by the go by the Coast Guard house and
then<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:46.370> head<00:02:46.520> out<00:02:46.570> getting<00:02:47.570> over<00:02:47.840> that

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
then and then head out getting over that

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.290 
then and then head out getting over that
area<00:02:48.230> just<00:02:48.680> around<00:02:48.980> high<00:02:49.220> tide<00:02:49.489> has<00:02:49.790> been<00:02:50.060> good

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
area just around high tide has been good

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
area just around high tide has been good
time<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.230> deploy<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.860> inflatable<00:02:52.519> pontoons

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
time to deploy the inflatable pontoons

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.540 
time to deploy the inflatable pontoons
these<00:02:54.320> are<00:02:54.500> nice<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:54.830> they<00:02:54.950> don't<00:02:55.220> extend

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
these are nice because they don't extend

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.820 
these are nice because they don't extend
too<00:02:55.760> far<00:02:56.030> from<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.360> boat<00:02:56.600> so<00:02:57.410> they<00:02:57.620> don't

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
too far from the boat so they don't

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.430 
too far from the boat so they don't
interfere<00:02:57.890> with<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.700> troll<00:02:59.019> they<00:03:00.019> just<00:03:00.230> hook

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
interfere with the troll they just hook

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.660 
interfere with the troll they just hook
on<00:03:00.620> like<00:03:00.860> you're<00:03:01.010> putting<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.280> paddle

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
on like you're putting the paddle

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.160 
on like you're putting the paddle
together<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.750> pretty<00:03:02.959> simple

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
together so it's a pretty simple

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.400 
together so it's a pretty simple
construction<00:03:03.620> here<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:05.690> tube<00:03:05.989> which<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
construction here the this tube which is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.550 
construction here the this tube which is
made<00:03:06.590> pretty<00:03:06.830> much<00:03:07.070> like<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> kayak<00:03:07.820> paddle

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
made pretty much like a kayak paddle

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.310 
made pretty much like a kayak paddle
just<00:03:09.560> pops<00:03:09.800> on<00:03:10.070> put<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.910> clip<00:03:11.180> on<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:12.410> then

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
just pops on put the clip on and then

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.410 
just pops on put the clip on and then
this<00:03:15.320> rod<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.340> always<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> part<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.299> the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
this rod here is always a part of the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.630 
this rod here is always a part of the
boat<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:20.030> just<00:03:22.630> click<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:25.459> got

boat and you just click it in it's got

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.069 
boat and you just click it in it's got
three<00:03:25.850> different<00:03:25.880> adjustments<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.870> can<00:03:26.930> be

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
three different adjustments you can be

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.720 
three different adjustments you can be
on<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.410> water<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.769> little<00:03:27.950> bit<00:03:28.220> above<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.640> or

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
on the water a little bit above it or

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.699 
on the water a little bit above it or
quite<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> bit<00:03:29.209> above<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.380> for<00:03:30.530> night

cliffs a lot of times I'll find all the
water<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.410> fine<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.880> kayaking<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:38.989> what

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140
