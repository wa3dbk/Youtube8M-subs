complete you may only be five or eight
pounds<00:00:50.089> heavier<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:50.960> you're<00:00:51.140> gonna<00:00:51.290> look

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
pounds heavier but you're gonna look

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.020 
pounds heavier but you're gonna look
fifteen<00:00:51.979> or<00:00:52.070> twenty<00:00:52.309> pounds<00:00:52.580> every<00:00:52.729> because

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
fifteen or twenty pounds every because

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.640 
fifteen or twenty pounds every because
everything<00:00:53.360> flows<00:00:53.689> the<00:00:54.260> way<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.619> needs

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
everything flows the way that it needs

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.630 
everything flows the way that it needs
to<00:00:54.949> flow<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:59.530> feel<00:01:00.530> like<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.890> what<00:01:01.309> we<00:01:01.430> needed

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
to flow I feel like that what we needed

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.090 
to flow I feel like that what we needed
to<00:01:01.760> work<00:01:02.000> on<00:01:02.150> was<00:01:02.510> from<00:01:02.869> the<00:01:02.930> top<00:01:03.140> down<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:03.920> need

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
to work on was from the top down we need

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.789 
to work on was from the top down we need
to<00:01:04.189> create<00:01:04.369> more<00:01:04.729> rear<00:01:05.330> delt<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.350> therefore

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
to create more rear delt so therefore

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.740 
to create more rear delt so therefore
his<00:01:07.250> delt<00:01:07.640> will<00:01:07.759> be<00:01:07.850> more<00:01:08.030> complete<00:01:08.240> not<00:01:08.509> only

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
his delt will be more complete not only

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.960 
his delt will be more complete not only
on<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.900> side<00:01:09.140> poses<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.549> fact<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
on the side poses but on the fact of a

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.440 
on the side poses but on the fact of a
bicep<00:01:11.360> post<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.900> also<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:13.189> rear<00:01:13.729> lat<00:01:14.180> spread

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
bicep post and also the rear lat spread

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.380 
bicep post and also the rear lat spread
pose<00:01:14.689> but<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:15.979> also<00:01:16.220> needed<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.640> lower<00:01:16.939> to

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
pose but we also needed to lower to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.090 
pose but we also needed to lower to
thicken<00:01:17.630> up<00:01:17.780> his<00:01:17.960> lower<00:01:18.200> lats<00:01:18.470> because<00:01:18.950> he's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
thicken up his lower lats because he's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.920 
thicken up his lower lats because he's
got<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.280> nice<00:01:19.490> small<00:01:20.030> waist<00:01:20.299> especially<00:01:20.810> from

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
got a nice small waist especially from

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.600 
got a nice small waist especially from
behind<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.380> what<00:01:21.890> we're<00:01:22.009> gonna<00:01:22.070> do<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.460> we're

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
behind and what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.880 
behind and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:01:22.670> try<00:01:22.939> to<00:01:23.000> build<00:01:23.299> those<00:01:23.570> lower<00:01:23.840> lotsa<00:01:24.409> so

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
gonna try to build those lower lotsa so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.290 
gonna try to build those lower lotsa so
therefore<00:01:25.220> he<00:01:25.310> creates<00:01:25.700> depth<00:01:26.000> from<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
therefore he creates depth from the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000 
therefore he creates depth from the
erectors<00:01:26.870> all<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.350> way<00:01:27.470> up<00:01:27.650> into<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.890> upper

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
erectors all the way up into the upper

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.380 
erectors all the way up into the upper

spine<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.020> he<00:02:02.110> can<00:02:02.229> get<00:02:02.380> maximum<00:02:02.619> flexion

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.190

her lap ten what it did was it put a

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.990 
her lap ten what it did was it put a
little<00:02:11.830> bit<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.099> healing<00:02:12.370> be<00:02:12.640> when<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.879> would

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
little bit of healing be when I would

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.990 
little bit of healing be when I would
give<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.239> pools<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.860> said<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> pulling<00:02:15.790> you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
give on pools so I said a pulling you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.470 
give on pools so I said a pulling you
know<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.239> my<00:02:16.390> elbows<00:02:16.840> lower<00:02:17.230> paring<00:02:17.830> down

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
know with my elbows lower paring down

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.580 
know with my elbows lower paring down
because<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.599> tore<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.930> right<00:02:20.140> out<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.379> lower

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
because it tore up right out there lower

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.470 
because it tore up right out there lower
light<00:02:20.980> area<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.819> always<00:02:22.030> want<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.269> pull

people you watch them go through the

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.119 
people you watch them go through the
motions<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.750> whenever<00:03:57.080> they<00:03:57.230> do<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.709> reverse

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
motions is whenever they do a reverse

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.729 
motions is whenever they do a reverse
strip<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.670> their<00:03:58.760> palms<00:03:59.030> are<00:03:59.299> up<00:03:59.500> you're<00:04:00.500> more

strip and their palms are up you're more

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.650

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
likely you're pulling a lot more

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.509 
likely you're pulling a lot more
downward<00:04:03.080> or<00:04:03.440> with<00:04:03.530> your<00:04:03.650> lower<00:04:03.830> lats<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.370> what

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
downward or with your lower lats is what

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
like to find it pops over on you know

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.460 
like to find it pops over on you know
that<00:04:09.920> pools<00:04:10.599> most<00:04:11.599> likely<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.049> elbows<00:04:12.349> are

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
that pools most likely the elbows are

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.870 
that pools most likely the elbows are
gonna<00:04:12.590> kind<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.920> come<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.370> little<00:04:13.519> bit<00:04:13.730> more

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
gonna kind of come a little bit more

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.150 
gonna kind of come a little bit more
back<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:14.630> gonna<00:04:14.750> have<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:14.959> PD<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.590> little

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
back it's gonna have that PD a little

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.219 
back it's gonna have that PD a little
bit<00:04:16.250> more<00:04:16.400> upper<00:04:16.760> back<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.239> no<00:04:17.419> more<00:04:17.600> try<00:04:17.900> you

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
bit more upper back and no more try you

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.219 
bit more upper back and no more try you
know<00:04:18.320> upper<00:04:18.680> lats<00:04:18.889> so<00:04:19.729> by<00:04:20.060> pulling<00:04:20.329> by<00:04:20.930> putting

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
know upper lats so by pulling by putting

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.840 
know upper lats so by pulling by putting
my<00:04:21.320> elbows<00:04:21.680> reversed<00:04:22.040> if<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.400> can<00:04:22.580> keep<00:04:22.700> my

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
my elbows reversed if I can keep my

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.240 
my elbows reversed if I can keep my
elbows<00:04:23.210> tucked<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.780> keep<00:04:24.500> my<00:04:24.650> shoulder<00:04:25.010> blades

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
elbows tucked in keep my shoulder blades

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.529 
elbows tucked in keep my shoulder blades
down<00:04:25.490> more<00:04:25.790> it<00:04:26.030> makes<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.330> more<00:04:26.419> comfortable

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
down more it makes it more comfortable

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.050 
down more it makes it more comfortable
for<00:04:27.260> me<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:27.919> pull<00:04:28.370> whoa

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
for me to pull whoa

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.690 
for me to pull whoa
so<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.840> can't<00:04:30.260> actually<00:04:30.380> do<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.740> regular<00:04:31.070> reverse

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
so I can't actually do a regular reverse

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.909 
so I can't actually do a regular reverse
strip<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.150> could<00:04:32.600> do<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.930> but<00:04:33.139> it's<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.830> little

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
strip I could do it but it's a little

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.500 
strip I could do it but it's a little
counterproductive<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.820> because<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.180> hurts<00:04:35.360> my

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
counterproductive to because it hurts my

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.210 
counterproductive to because it hurts my
wrist<00:04:35.780> but<00:04:35.930> if<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.139> do<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.440> EZ<00:04:36.680> bar<00:04:36.949> which<00:04:37.190> is

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
wrist but if I do the EZ bar which is

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.279 
wrist but if I do the EZ bar which is
the<00:04:37.340> cable<00:04:37.729> are<00:04:37.940> where<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.810> owner<00:04:39.080> says<00:04:39.260> the

the cable are where the owner says the
tricep<00:04:39.800> baller<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.280> wanted<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:40.700> do<00:04:40.789> a<00:04:40.820> close

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
tricep baller so I wanted to do a close

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.350 
tricep baller so I wanted to do a close
strip<00:04:41.539> reverse<00:04:42.410> grip<00:04:42.710> but<00:04:43.580> he<00:04:43.880> knew<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.180> full

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
strip reverse grip but he knew the full

my back you wrecked the whole time and

my back you wrecked the whole time and
hey<00:05:20.710> with<00:05:21.039> the<00:05:21.159> rope<00:05:21.339> you<00:05:21.490> could<00:05:21.639> actually<00:05:21.819> go

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:22.119 
hey with the rope you could actually go

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:23.790 
hey with the rope you could actually go
a<00:05:22.149> little<00:05:22.419> bit<00:05:22.659> deeper<00:05:22.899> when<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.379> pull<00:05:23.589> back

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
a little bit deeper when you pull back

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.189 
a little bit deeper when you pull back
you<00:05:24.339> could<00:05:24.460> get<00:05:24.639> your<00:05:24.759> hands<00:05:25.089> past<00:05:25.809> your

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
you could get your hands past your

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.019 
you could get your hands past your
stomach<00:05:26.589> and<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:26.889> waste<00:05:27.129> a<00:05:27.279> little<00:05:27.490> bit<00:05:27.639> so

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
stomach and you waste a little bit so

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:29.159 
stomach and you waste a little bit so
gives<00:05:28.210> you<00:05:28.270> a<00:05:28.300> little<00:05:28.419> bit<00:05:28.539> further<00:05:28.749> cuts

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
gives you a little bit further cuts

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.639 
gives you a little bit further cuts
action<00:05:29.619> versus<00:05:30.430> if<00:05:31.119> you<00:05:31.330> use<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.539> bar<00:05:31.899> you<00:05:32.469> have

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:32.649 
action versus if you use a bar you have

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.320 
action versus if you use a bar you have
to<00:05:32.830> stop<00:05:33.129> when<00:05:33.369> it<00:05:33.490> comes<00:05:33.699> to<00:05:33.849> your<00:05:33.969> waist<00:05:34.180> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
to stop when it comes to your waist you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.269 
to stop when it comes to your waist you
can't<00:05:34.569> go<00:05:34.719> any<00:05:34.899> further<00:05:35.050> back<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:36.039> gives<00:05:36.189> a

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
can't go any further back so it gives a

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:41.730 
can't go any further back so it gives a
little<00:05:36.399> bit<00:05:36.550> deeper<00:05:36.729> detection<00:05:40.529> so<00:05:41.529> weight

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
little bit deeper detection so weight

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.040 
little bit deeper detection so weight
wise<00:05:41.949> I<00:05:42.249> don't<00:05:42.399> really<00:05:42.550> because<00:05:42.749> it's<00:05:43.749> a<00:05:43.839> very

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
wise I don't really because it's a very

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.749 
wise I don't really because it's a very
high<00:05:44.199> volume<00:05:44.439> but<00:05:44.649> I<00:05:44.770> actually<00:05:45.009> consider<00:05:45.580> it

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
high volume but I actually consider it

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.839 
high volume but I actually consider it
you<00:05:45.879> know<00:05:45.969> heavier<00:05:46.330> weight<00:05:46.599> for<00:05:46.839> me<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.169> like

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
you know heavier weight for me to like

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.249 
you know heavier weight for me to like
the<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:49.089> poundage<00:05:49.689> is<00:05:49.809> not<00:05:49.959> what<00:05:50.169> I'm

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
the the poundage is not what I'm

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.290 
the the poundage is not what I'm
considering<00:05:50.860> heavy<00:05:51.069> if<00:05:51.639> you<00:05:51.849> know<00:05:51.969> it's<00:05:52.180> like

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
considering heavy if you know it's like

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.059 
considering heavy if you know it's like
all<00:05:52.539> my<00:05:52.749> laps<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.199> stuff<00:05:53.379> for<00:05:53.499> a<00:05:53.559> nice<00:05:53.709> forward

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
all my laps and stuff for a nice forward

all my laps and stuff for a nice forward
smooth<00:05:54.520> if<00:05:55.209> I<00:05:55.330> wanted<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:55.659> put<00:05:55.809> the<00:05:55.930> stack<00:05:56.169> on

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
smooth if I wanted to put the stack on

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.129 
smooth if I wanted to put the stack on
that<00:05:56.649> hold<00:05:57.009> or<00:05:57.430> broke<00:05:57.909> go<00:05:58.209> to<00:05:58.270> seven<00:05:58.749> plates<00:05:58.930> or

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
that hold or broke go to seven plates or

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.549 
that hold or broke go to seven plates or
T<00:05:59.289> bars<00:05:59.559> and<00:05:59.949> 405<00:06:00.819> or<00:06:01.029> whatever<00:06:01.629> you<00:06:01.899> know<00:06:02.050> if<00:06:02.409> I

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:02.559 
T bars and 405 or whatever you know if I

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.170 
T bars and 405 or whatever you know if I
wanted<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:02.949> do<00:06:03.129> it<00:06:03.279> I<00:06:03.430> could<00:06:03.610> do<00:06:03.789> it<00:06:03.819> but<00:06:04.059> it's

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
wanted to do it I could do it but it's

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.459 
wanted to do it I could do it but it's
not<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.360> matter<00:06:04.569> of<00:06:04.689> gold<00:06:04.930> from<00:06:05.080> point<00:06:05.349> A<00:06:05.439> to

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
not a matter of gold from point A to

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.559 
not a matter of gold from point A to
point<00:06:05.589> B<00:06:05.800> it's<00:06:06.580> about<00:06:06.729> how<00:06:06.939> you<00:06:06.999> get<00:06:07.389> from

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
point B it's about how you get from

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.480 
point B it's about how you get from
point<00:06:07.719> A<00:06:07.869> to<00:06:07.899> point<00:06:08.020> P<00:06:08.379> or<00:06:08.649> doing<00:06:08.949> it<00:06:09.039> smooth

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
point A to point P or doing it smooth

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.449 
point A to point P or doing it smooth
and<00:06:09.729> it's<00:06:09.849> hold<00:06:10.089> so<00:06:10.719> I<00:06:10.779> used<00:06:11.019> a<00:06:11.169> lot<00:06:11.349> to<00:06:12.099> be<00:06:12.249> the

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:12.459 
and it's hold so I used a lot to be the

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:13.769 
and it's hold so I used a lot to be the
weight<00:06:12.639> was<00:06:12.819> heavy<00:06:13.059> when<00:06:13.419> it's<00:06:13.569> under

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:13.779 
weight was heavy when it's under

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.139 
weight was heavy when it's under
controlled<00:06:14.199> motion<00:06:14.589> so<00:06:15.279> I<00:06:15.519> was<00:06:15.759> doing<00:06:15.999> heavy

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149 
controlled motion so I was doing heavy

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.659 
controlled motion so I was doing heavy
weight<00:06:16.449> plus<00:06:16.779> high<00:06:17.019> volume<00:06:17.469> so<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.610> know

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
weight plus high volume so you know

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.100 
weight plus high volume so you know
people<00:06:18.849> asked<00:06:19.149> would<00:06:19.300> you<00:06:19.360> rather<00:06:19.539> do<00:06:19.719> volume

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
people asked would you rather do volume

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.019 
people asked would you rather do volume
or<00:06:20.259> driven<00:06:20.469> weight<00:06:20.769> it's<00:06:21.009> volume<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.759> weight

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
or driven weight it's volume and weight

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.019 
or driven weight it's volume and weight
together<00:06:22.300> so<00:06:23.259> it's<00:06:23.439> maximum<00:06:23.889> intensity<00:06:24.279> every

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
together so it's maximum intensity every

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.699 
together so it's maximum intensity every
workout<00:06:25.360> so<00:06:25.599> just<00:06:25.809> because<00:06:26.080> the<00:06:26.229> number<00:06:26.499> looks

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:26.709 
workout so just because the number looks

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.259 
workout so just because the number looks
different<00:06:27.129> you<00:06:27.279> know<00:06:27.669> I<00:06:27.729> could<00:06:27.879> be<00:06:27.909> doing<00:06:28.209> a

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:28.269 
different you know I could be doing a

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.689 
different you know I could be doing a
set<00:06:28.479> of<00:06:28.719> six<00:06:29.019> reps<00:06:29.259> or<00:06:29.499> a<00:06:29.529> set<00:06:29.800> of<00:06:29.830> 20<00:06:30.550> reps

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
set of six reps or a set of 20 reps

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.179 
set of six reps or a set of 20 reps
either<00:06:31.539> way<00:06:31.809> that<00:06:32.169> 20<00:06:32.439> reps<00:06:32.649> are<00:06:32.800> still<00:06:32.979> having

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:33.189 
either way that 20 reps are still having

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:37.649 
either way that 20 reps are still having
way<00:06:33.519> well<00:06:34.419> with<00:06:34.749> relation<00:06:35.169> to<00:06:35.199> what<00:06:35.379> up<00:06:35.469> dude
