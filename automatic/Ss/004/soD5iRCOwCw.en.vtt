 italy 70 the evolution of the pen with no more conceptual divisions me 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.679
 structural 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.809
 it is the natural result of bay look and as the designer says carlo 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.890
 galeazzi aurigi nor from a design process that sets itself the goal 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.369
 the main morphological and functional technological innovation 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.520
 of the open boat 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.800
 the concept of open refers to very sporty use of fast navigation to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 short and medium-haul cruise 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.850
 reason for which 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.340
 distribution solutions spaces 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.590
 must be organized to offer maximum comfort with reference to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.780
 above parameters

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.440
 that push the vehicle as fast as possible and with a sea tightness 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 unexceptionable 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.500
 the new model presented the bay italy 70 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 is a summary of these concepts 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.270
 a single glazed window disappears completely, placing the cockpit at the saloon 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 and creating just one meal nothing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.399
 when the window is closed the passage between the outside and the inside takes place 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.040
 through an integrated sliding door 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.460
 the bridge deck to comply with the lack of large spaces is easily and truly 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.930
 seamless wires between the external cockpit and the interior saloon 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.340

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.429
 the legacy is based on a concept of refinement with a decidedly taste 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:43.929
 minimalist masculine with a focus on kyalami namento
