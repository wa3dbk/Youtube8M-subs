we<00:00:32.660> actually<00:00:32.840> mold<00:00:33.320> when<00:00:34.220> making<00:00:34.460> the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
we actually mold when making the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.400 
we actually mold when making the
plastics<00:00:35.150> so<00:00:35.750> that's<00:00:35.930> why<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.080> lot<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.320> people

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
plastics so that's why a lot of people

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.350 
plastics so that's why a lot of people
say<00:00:36.770> oh<00:00:36.950> look<00:00:37.250> similar<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.850> older<00:00:38.180> style

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360

models<00:00:38.840> but<00:00:39.880> you<00:00:40.880> are<00:00:41.060> obviously<00:00:41.510> like<00:00:41.840> a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
models but you are obviously like a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.040 
models but you are obviously like a
separate<00:00:42.290> tool<00:00:43.090> get<00:00:44.090> anything<00:00:44.300> actual<00:00:44.810> weight

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050

roughly<00:00:59.980> I've<00:01:00.250> seen<00:01:00.580> it<00:01:00.700> coming

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
roughly I've seen it coming

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
about 4 12 extremely light

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.460 
about 4 12 extremely light
pretty<00:01:11.310> much<00:01:11.460> 220<00:01:11.970> pound<00:01:12.210> difference<00:01:12.470> from

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
the 2009 for 2011

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.040 
the 2009 for 2011
actually<00:01:17.270> too<00:01:17.420> long

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
actually too long

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.700 
actually too long
there's<00:01:19.560> 12%

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.390 

later<00:01:26.640> crankshaft

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.340 

I<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> guys<00:01:30.000> part<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.420> plot<00:01:30.690> intro

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
I know you guys part of the plot intro

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.780 
I know you guys part of the plot intro
those<00:01:34.040> two<00:01:34.310> things<00:01:34.520> at<00:01:34.760> home<00:01:35.380> just<00:01:36.380> actually

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
those two things at home just actually

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:45.830 
those two things at home just actually
rotating<00:01:38.259> now<00:01:39.759> moving<00:01:40.759> inside

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:56.500 

overall<00:01:46.439> been<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.859> gas<00:01:47.039> mileage

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.190 

so<00:01:57.110> that's<00:01:58.070> just<00:01:58.190> something<00:01:58.340> inside<00:01:58.700> ng<00:01:59.390> right

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
so that's just something inside ng right

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.520 
so that's just something inside ng right
there<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.410> far<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.620> weight<00:02:00.770> loss<00:02:01.450> brain<00:02:02.450> does

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
there as far as weight loss brain does

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.559 
there as far as weight loss brain does
5-piece<00:02:04.369> pass<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:06.170> pacify<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.920> pieces<00:02:07.580> the

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
5-piece pass to pacify the pieces the

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.680 
5-piece pass to pacify the pieces the
main<00:02:09.369> reason<00:02:10.369> behind<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.420> when<00:02:11.660> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
main reason behind that is when you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.199 
main reason behind that is when you
actually<00:02:11.930> do<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.560> by<00:02:12.740> these<00:02:13.069> past<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:14.030> can

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
actually do it by these past you can

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.449 
actually do it by these past you can
break<00:02:14.450> down<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.900> drain<00:02:15.200> part<00:02:15.590> by<00:02:15.770> part<00:02:16.069> and

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
break down the drain part by part and

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.480 
break down the drain part by part and
actually<00:02:17.060> shave<00:02:17.360> weight<00:02:17.750> part<00:02:18.530> by<00:02:18.650> part<00:02:18.860> so

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
actually shave weight part by part so

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.210 
actually shave weight part by part so
it's<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:19.819> just<00:02:19.880> one<00:02:20.480> big<00:02:20.780> piece<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:22.130> that's

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it's not just one big piece and that's

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.930 
it's not just one big piece and that's
it<00:02:22.489> enough<00:02:23.000> piece<00:02:23.330> by<00:02:23.510> piece<00:02:23.540> each

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it enough piece by piece each

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.660 
it enough piece by piece each
the<00:02:25.180> walk

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.240 

right<00:02:28.599> now<00:02:28.780> horsepower<00:02:29.349> I<00:02:29.740> said<00:02:29.950> I've<00:02:30.069> seen<00:02:30.190> a

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
right now horsepower I said I've seen a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.240 
right now horsepower I said I've seen a
couple<00:02:30.280> different<00:02:30.610> numbers<00:02:31.090> at<00:02:32.020> one<00:02:32.500> point

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.780 

in<00:02:36.250> 2009

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in 2009

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140 
in 2009
so<00:02:39.599> you're<00:02:39.750> looking<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:40.110> 325<00:02:40.799> horsepower

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.059 

pretty<00:02:43.750> much<00:02:43.870> what<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.049> have<00:02:44.230> seen

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.250 

three<00:02:47.519> chocolate

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
three chocolate

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.740 
three chocolate
that

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.440 
that
the<00:02:52.020> didn't<00:02:52.230> raise<00:02:52.350> pressure<00:02:52.800> my<00:02:53.070> shower

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the didn't raise pressure my shower

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.820 
the didn't raise pressure my shower
so<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> action<00:02:55.560> in

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.800 

create<00:02:59.460> something<00:03:02.240> we<00:03:03.240> were<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.660> around

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
create something we were going around

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.020 
create something we were going around
they<00:03:04.080> did<00:03:04.290> go<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.800> Brembo<00:03:05.550> brakes<00:03:05.850> up

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
they did go to the Brembo brakes up

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.990 
they did go to the Brembo brakes up
front<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.170> 310<00:03:08.010> millimeter<00:03:08.490> jewelry<00:03:08.970> a

year<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.220> 54.5<00:03:40.540> which<00:03:41.540> means<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> bike<00:03:42.080> is

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
year is 54.5 which means the bike is
