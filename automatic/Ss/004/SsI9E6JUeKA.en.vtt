00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.000
What if I had 1% share on new taste of Doritos?
I’d definitely buy a sport car
Only a mansion would be enough for me
I’d buy a ferry and tour in Bosphorus
I’d go to some shop and do shopping like crazy
I’d go to Music Producers Market and record an album
I’d buy Bosphorus Bridge and go fishing randomly for one hour in a day

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hello

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.450
Hello

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.495
Are you dealing with?

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.100
With what, sir?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.980
Plasma

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.030
Yes, I will help
Ok then

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:14.215
I’m planning to buy an lcd TV

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:16.460
I will buy one and then another.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.850
I mean...

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:17.885
...if you are interested in particular model?
- I mean, do you know what I’m saying?

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.620
I will buy all the plasma in the shop for example.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.450
All the plasma, you’d like to buy...

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.765
...all of them in the shop!

00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.210
Ok, we can sell all, no problem.

00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:27.785
How much?

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.325
They will cost around 53000 TL

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:31.670
Do you know what I’m saying?

00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:32.750
I will buy them now,

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:34.400
I will have money in 3 to 4 months.

00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:37.632
I will pay for them 3 or 4 months later. I’ll have a lot, I’m sure

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:39.260
I see 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.625
Let me make a deposit! Deposit?

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:43.420
We can’t do that way.
Let me...

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.285
...make deposit.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:45.780
Emin

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.745
I’m making you a deposit. Emin.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.455
You take him and let him work wherever you want.

00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:52.665
How much does it cost for this shop?

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:55.785
Actually I don’t know the price for the shop.

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.150
Do you know what I’m saying? Let’s do that way.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:00:59.290
I’ll buy this shop, too...

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:01.444
...and you’ll be boss here.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.027
Ah, happy to hear that.

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:05.368
I’ve ordered a car and a house...

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.103
...but none of them pushed me that hard as you!

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:10.190
Even if I let you, system won’t.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:10.853
My gosh, look at that!

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:12.132
Would you stand bail for me?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.700
No way!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.045
We took up an unbelievable business. You’d go crazy if you only knew.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:16.952
Potato chips business.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:18.563
We’re giving away chips.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.620
Take those chips.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.657
I can’t eat in my shift.

00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:23.093
You should create a taste for Doritos, ok

00:01:23.095 --> 00:01:24.025
You should create a taste for Doritos

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:26.580
If the jury likes the taste you’ve created, 

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:27.595
they will give you 1% share from this taste’s selling.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.585
I’m in.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:29.500
I’m happy for you.

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:31.605
I’m sure I’ll win. I’m dead sure. I believe myself with this.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.085
- Let’s make this trade...
- Trust me...

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:34.543
- ...when you have your money.
- ...money will come. That’s for sure. I’ve created an unbelievable taste.

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:35.250
- Let me...
- You’d go crazy

00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:36.760
- ...reserve the TV you want.
- You’d go crazy. 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.297
Do you want me to issue a bill? Let me draw up a bill.

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:40.185
Doesn't even necessary

00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:41.700
I’m giving my biggest oath. Here, look,

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:43.782
 he bought 20 plasma TV. Promise.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.927
18 what? What is our agreement date?

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:46.451
May?

00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:49.427
He promised to pay the money in 18 August.

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:51.071
Cross my heart, I promise!

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:53.062
I swear, I’ll pay.

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:55.120
As I said, system won’t let it. There’s nothing I can do.

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:55.700
Who is system?

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.883
May I touch

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:57.763
Yes you can look over.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:01.288
This can’t be pull away, right?

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:03.688
 Let us handle this there?

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.970
You just stand in front of the door and we walk a little?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.843
No way

00:02:06.847 --> 00:02:07.333
Really?

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.342
Yes, it’s attached to the system.

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:11.637
Uður

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:13.945
Uður

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:16.269
Uður, 5 months later.

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.277
He gave it.

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:21.265
 I gave him a bill, a petition.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.415
 C’mon.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:27.742
Security!

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.930
He’s not giving!

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:31.655
I don’t understand where you are trying to go!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.877
Let us go, ha! Give it and let us go.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.375
- It won’t make any help.
- What are you shooting, what?

00:02:37.795 --> 00:02:39.025
- I think they’re shooting you. I…

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:41.125
- They’re shooting you.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.695
- Me?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.170
I’ll be glad if the guy leaves the TV on its place.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.711
They’re debit to us.

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:47.310
Hi.

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:50.160
Doritos!
