reason<00:01:59.670> why<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.880> weight<00:02:00.210> limit<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.630> 15

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
reason why the weight limit is 15

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
reason why the weight limit is 15
kilograms<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> obviously<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.039> clear<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> see

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640

the<00:02:03.299> inertia<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.899> car<00:02:04.109> will<00:02:04.979> only<00:02:05.249> lock

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
the inertia in the car will only lock

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.609 
the inertia in the car will only lock
off<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.299> weight<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> child<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
off at that weight so if the child is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
off at that weight so if the child is
below<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> way<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.460> will<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.700> unsafe<00:02:09.240> in

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
below that way there will be unsafe in

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.229 
below that way there will be unsafe in
the<00:02:09.720> car<00:02:09.899> seat<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.550> continue<00:02:11.909> on<00:02:12.090> with

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the car seat so you continue on with

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.030 
the car seat so you continue on with
what<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> were<00:02:12.540> doing<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.840> go<00:02:13.080> across<00:02:13.890> the

what you were doing you go across the

what you were doing you go across the

buckle to help you do this it's very

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.660 
buckle to help you do this it's very
important<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.410> go<00:02:26.530> back<00:02:26.830> under<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> arm<00:02:27.460> as

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
important to go back under the arm as

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
important to go back under the arm as
this<00:02:27.820> will<00:02:27.970> stop<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.360> child<00:02:28.660> I'm<00:02:29.170> having

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
this will stop the child I'm having

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.220 
this will stop the child I'm having
about<00:02:29.560> cut<00:02:29.830> across<00:02:30.010> their<00:02:30.250> neck<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.480> slide<00:02:31.990> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
about cut across their neck and slide it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.730 
about cut across their neck and slide it
into<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.400> clip<00:02:34.230> sliding<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.290> into<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.530> clip

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
into the clip sliding it into the clip

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.120 
into the clip sliding it into the clip
is<00:02:35.920> easier<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.760> raise<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:36.970> headrest

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
is easier when you raise the headrest

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.380 
is easier when you raise the headrest
because<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.250> clip<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.670> more<00:02:39.880> visible<00:02:40.150> when

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
because the clip is more visible when

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
because the clip is more visible when
you're<00:02:40.510> fitting<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.900> seat<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.840> slid<00:02:44.350> in

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
you're fitting the seat you slid in

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.950 
you're fitting the seat you slid in
easily<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.390> quickly<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.630> seat<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
easily and quickly because the seat is

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.870 
easily and quickly because the seat is
only<00:02:53.140> fitted<00:02:53.530> using<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.830> seatbelt<00:02:54.070> this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
only fitted using the seatbelt this

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.270 
only fitted using the seatbelt this
means<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.630> move<00:02:55.930> around<00:02:56.080> now<00:02:56.800> maxi-cosi

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
means it can move around now maxi-cosi

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.470 
means it can move around now maxi-cosi
have<00:02:57.520> tried<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.700> solve<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.120> problem<00:02:58.240> and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
have tried to solve this problem and

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.000 
have tried to solve this problem and
they've<00:02:58.600> done<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> quite<00:02:58.990> well<00:02:59.050> what<00:02:59.890> they've

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
they've done it quite well what they've

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.260 
they've done it quite well what they've
done<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.870> they've<00:03:01.870> put<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.410> tether<00:03:02.710> strap

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
done is they've put in a tether strap

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.220 
done is they've put in a tether strap
and<00:03:04.270> what<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.540> does<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.720> slides<00:03:05.080> between

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and what that does that slides between

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.380 
and what that does that slides between
the<00:03:05.470> headrests<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:06.100> reduces<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the headrests and it just reduces the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.610 
the headrests and it just reduces the
side-to-side<00:03:07.750> movement<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> seats

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
side-to-side movement that the seats

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.790 
side-to-side movement that the seats
going<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.200> leg<00:03:11.320> when<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
going to have in the leg when the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
going to have in the leg when the
headrest<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:12.340> here<00:03:12.550> slide<00:03:13.300> straight<00:03:13.600> in

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
headrest is up here slide straight in

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.300 
headrest is up here slide straight in
like<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.270> what<00:03:16.390> that'll<00:03:16.540> do<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:17.160> keep<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
like so and what that'll do is keep the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.860 
like so and what that'll do is keep the
seat<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.520> lot<00:03:18.670> firmer<00:03:18.910> obviously<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> child's

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
seat a lot firmer obviously the child's

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.660 
seat a lot firmer obviously the child's
weight<00:03:20.020> will<00:03:20.170> also<00:03:20.440> weigh<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.680> seat<00:03:20.860> down<00:03:21.070> but

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
weight will also weigh the seat down but

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.010 
weight will also weigh the seat down but
this<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:21.940> feature<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.300> isn't<00:03:22.630> very<00:03:22.780> common

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
this is a feature that isn't very common

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.560 
this is a feature that isn't very common
on<00:03:23.200> lot<00:03:23.350> car<00:03:23.560> seats<00:03:23.800> it's<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.640> fairly<00:03:24.880> universal

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
on lot car seats it's a fairly universal

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.479 
on lot car seats it's a fairly universal
seat<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.050> should<00:03:26.320> fit<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.680> very<00:03:26.950> easily<00:03:27.160> into

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
seat and should fit in very easily into

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.729 
seat and should fit in very easily into
most<00:03:27.760> vehicles<00:03:27.930> there<00:03:28.930> are<00:03:29.020> only<00:03:29.110> two<00:03:29.350> ways<00:03:29.560> in

most vehicles there are only two ways in

most vehicles there are only two ways in
