game<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.980> unity3d<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> full<00:00:24.689> 3d<00:00:25.080> game

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
game in unity3d this is a full 3d game

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
game in unity3d this is a full 3d game
it<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.769> happens<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> camera<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.670> facing

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it just so happens the camera is facing

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.419 
it just so happens the camera is facing
directly<00:00:27.779> forward<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.859> object<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.340> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
directly forward into the object so it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
directly forward into the object so it
looks<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.820> 2d<00:00:30.330> objects<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.199> everything<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
looks like 2d objects but everything you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
looks like 2d objects but everything you
see<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> here<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.759> complete<00:00:33.030> 3d

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
see in here is actually a complete 3d

tutorial this expects you to know the
basics<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.009> programming<00:01:29.360> otherwise<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.750> know

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
basics of programming otherwise you know

basics of programming otherwise you know
following<00:01:31.320> along<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.619> my<00:01:31.740> codes<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.220> really

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
following along with my codes not really

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.530 
following along with my codes not really
going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.729> sense<00:01:32.939> I'm<00:01:33.090> not<00:01:33.119> explaining

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
going to make sense I'm not explaining

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to make sense I'm not explaining
what<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> variable<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.860> how<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> function

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
what a variable is or how a function

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.550 
what a variable is or how a function
works<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:36.119> anything<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.720> aspect<00:01:37.290> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
works or anything of that aspect it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
works or anything of that aspect it
assumes<00:01:37.979> you're<00:01:38.159> already<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
assumes you're already a bit of a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
assumes you're already a bit of a
programmer<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.990> unfamiliar<00:01:40.530> with

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
programmer you're just unfamiliar with

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.410 
programmer you're just unfamiliar with
unity<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> get<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.150> last

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
unity and I just got to get this last

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.999 
unity and I just got to get this last
block<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.140> load<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> next<00:01:43.710> level

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
block so I can load the next level

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
block so I can load the next level
because<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.970> loading<00:01:45.299> level<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
because we do have loading level put in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
because we do have loading level put in
but<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> admit<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.630> challenge

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
but I have to admit I have a challenge

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
but I have to admit I have a challenge
playing<00:01:48.840> my<00:01:48.930> own<00:01:49.079> game<00:01:49.259> apparently<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:50.280> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
playing my own game apparently get it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
playing my own game apparently get it
get<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.909> haven't<00:01:51.090> lost<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> life

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
get it get it I haven't lost the life

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
get it get it I haven't lost the life
though<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.590> level<00:01:52.770> has<00:01:52.950> two

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
though there we are this level has two

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.319 
though there we are this level has two
different<00:01:53.310> colored<00:01:53.460> blocks<00:01:53.850> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.149> very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
different colored blocks which is very

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.580 
different colored blocks which is very
exciting<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.930> blocks<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.470> I've

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
exciting because these blocks and I've

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.679 
exciting because these blocks and I've
missed<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> course<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.000> red<00:01:57.180> blocks<00:01:57.420> have

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
missed it of course the red blocks have

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
missed it of course the red blocks have
multiple<00:01:58.350> hit<00:01:58.500> points<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
multiple hit points and I just want to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.480 
multiple hit points and I just want to
demonstrate<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.719> won't<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.930> able<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
demonstrate that and I won't be able to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.410 
demonstrate that and I won't be able to
you<00:02:02.490> also<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:02.759> lives<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
you also have lives you can see in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.300 
you also have lives you can see in the
bond<00:02:03.570> corner<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.140> leave<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> ball<00:02:05.009> go

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
bond corner so if I leave the ball go

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.010 
bond corner so if I leave the ball go
Boop<00:02:05.700> we've<00:02:06.030> lost<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> life<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> there's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
Boop we've lost the life and there's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.570 
Boop we've lost the life and there's
even<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> game<00:02:07.439> over<00:02:07.649> screen<00:02:07.740> there<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.220> see

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
even a game over screen there we go see

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.830 
even a game over screen there we go see
a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.849> easier<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.179> way<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.539> blocks

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
a lot easier this way so these blocks

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.779 
a lot easier this way so these blocks
take<00:02:10.020> three<00:02:10.229> hits<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> kill

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
take three hits to kill

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.509 
take three hits to kill
like<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:11.810> i'll<00:02:12.650> send<00:02:12.829> it<00:02:12.860> sideways<00:02:13.189> i'm<00:02:13.340> just

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
like so i'll send it sideways i'm just

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.220 
like so i'll send it sideways i'm just
gonna<00:02:13.610> let<00:02:13.700> myself<00:02:13.819> die<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.900> we're<00:02:15.049> gonna<00:02:15.140> see

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
gonna let myself die and we're gonna see

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.179 
gonna let myself die and we're gonna see
via<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> game<00:02:15.859> over<00:02:16.069> screen<00:02:16.599> tada<00:02:18.189> fantastic

the<00:02:42.530> sea<00:02:42.680> nectar<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.430> can<00:02:43.519> prove

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the sea nectar just so that I can prove

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.479 
the sea nectar just so that I can prove
that<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.150> actually<00:02:44.470> 3d<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.189> you<00:02:46.250> can<00:02:46.370> see

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
that it's actually 3d so you can see

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.649 
that it's actually 3d so you can see
them<00:02:46.609> side<00:02:46.790> by<00:02:46.819> side<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.359> I'm<00:02:47.480> going<00:02:47.569> to

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
them side by side here I'm going to

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.539 
them side by side here I'm going to
launch<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.049> ball<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:49.069> we<00:02:49.159> go<00:02:49.220> back<00:02:49.340> in

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
launch the ball and then we go back in

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.860
