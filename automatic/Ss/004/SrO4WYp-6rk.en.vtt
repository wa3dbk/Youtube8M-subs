really a fantastic product and then I

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.749 
really a fantastic product and then I
got<00:05:42.979> this<00:05:43.129> vessel<00:05:43.639> in<00:05:43.789> one<00:05:44.060> as<00:05:45.009> aloe<00:05:46.009> vera<00:05:46.460> gel

as well but I don't think it's that good
because<00:05:49.129> the<00:05:49.279> texture<00:05:49.819> it<00:05:49.940> feels<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.479> bit<00:05:50.889> too

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889
