00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.980
 by the end of the 1990s the study of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 animes on rice has made a good 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.789
 and solid reputation after several 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.519
 decades of producing genre animes of 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.230
 Meccas during this time had done 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.180
 a good job creating stories that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.440
 encompassed other genres such as son and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.059
 romance in 1996 making use of the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.739
 acquired experience launched a product 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.629
 original that would stand out for its 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.299
 technical execution and cutting history 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.250
 epic and romantic without leaving aside the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.750
 act of the genre of make a season in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.750
 Step vision 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.970
 the particular history of this flower 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 places as the student's protagonist 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.870
 high school hitomi cannes here 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.730
 let's admit it there can not be a story 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.220
 anime epic without students of 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.080
 secondary hitomi has the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.300
 particularity of having certain powers 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.070
 of divination which at the beginning 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.740
 of history are manifested through 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.000
 of reading the tarot cards 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 In addition to the above, it is also a 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.960
 outstanding athlete in track events 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 so he spends his time training in 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.590
 company of your best friend and your 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.190
 eventually hitomi listen to rumors of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.590
 that his ampays known as loves not 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.660

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.460

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.190
 13 seconds in the 100 meters flat to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.050

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.150
 of tear drop hitomi and that has the 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.370
 strange quality of swinging once 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.399
 per second here is where the thing gets 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.680
 It makes interesting during the test a 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.900
 strange boy with armor appears e 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.700
 interrupts hitomi's career for 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.580
 after being attacked by a dragon 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 come out of a dimensional gap despite 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.209
 of the implacable of the creature thank you 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.640
 to the help of hitomi the boy achieves 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.910
 defeat her just to be taken by the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.590
 dimensional gap is so Hitomi is 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.630
 taken to the world of guy to a place 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.160
 fantastic inhabited by all kinds of 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.890
 creatures and where the moon and the earth 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.020
 they can be seen from the sky now 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 in the company of the boy which results 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.070
 to be pampa the heir to the throne of 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.780
 kingdom panel will already start an adventure 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.700
 to be able to know the secrets behind 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.830
 of this strange world as well as 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.660
 survive a terrible and brutal 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.760
 war against a ruthless enemy 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.430
 this is basically the premise of this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.420
 Flower narrated very generally as 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.090
 the story is becoming 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 proportionately more complex taking 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.140
 note that several 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.000
 story arcs depending on the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.920
 several characters that will go in and 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.990
 leaving the story each of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750
 They bring their perspective and vision 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.880
 of the conflict 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.890
 from the technical and visual point of view 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.560
 the vision of ska flow has a style 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 very unique and recognizable design of the 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.540
 characters is relatively simple but 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.070
 it does not look ugly or sloppy what 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.230
 contrasts with the sets 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.270
 they really tried to capture the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.860
 subtleties of the gaia world 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.620
 different races cultures and regions 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.090
 they are beautifully executed which 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.830
 would serve as the basis for 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.830
 subsequent productions of song rice 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.420
 and of course like a sunrise anime 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.220
 Meccas could be missing which 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.500
 they show off some of the most 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.350
 beautiful originals and showy of the genre 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.480
 Their design makes them look like gentlemen 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.760
 medieval with all the grace and class 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.220
 what that implies is the mecca that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.290
 gives the name to flow as ska anime 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.760
 Its design makes it very remarkable and its 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.500
 ability to transform into a 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.750
 flying vehicle in the shape of a dragon 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 will delight the lovers of these 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.520
 designs the characters mostly 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.220
 They are very well structured and they are very 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.080
 diverse for example vargas which is 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.670
 a samurai with a European armor and 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.609
 that speak of a machete of three meters 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.010
 or because which is an emo angel with a 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.870
 robotic arm although there's also 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.600
 some characters that feel something 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.480
 loose and forced the fighting and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.860
 Action sequences are excellent 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.870
 exploiting each of the resources that 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.120
 the genre can offer just like the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.830
 available technical resources 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.140
 this was little fights between 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.660
 mexicas are very recurrent and successful 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.690
 both in pursuit of history and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.490
 maintain the right doses of action 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.940
 music is one of the elements that 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.400
 plus 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.290
 in praise of this work because it was 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.470
 charge of one of the heavyweights of the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.260
 industry the very yoko cano which 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.840
 It is a guarantee of quality and diversity and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.390
 this anime is going since he has it from 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.740
 wonderful instrumental pieces 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.620
 moving to electronic music and 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.020
 Even Gregorian chants do not exaggerate 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.730
 when I say that the musical pieces 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.770
 used in this anime are true 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.270
 classics that confer a large part of 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.790
 its epic character 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.040
 although the ska flow vision is a great 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.530
 work is not exempt from presenting some 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.540
 failures in its structure although the 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.400
 original works of sunrise are not 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.770
 take you by the hand from the point of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.510
 narrative view on several occasions 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.810
 you can notice several loose ends 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.970
 between the story and the characters this 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.800
 will inevitably give you the feeling of 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.530
 that you jump out of an episode or that 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.300
 creators went on to add something 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.970
 this ends up happening the account 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.490
 Well, some arcs or conflicts 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.130
 general as individual are reached 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.020
 feel forced or unfinished 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.580
 besides the dyes and triangles 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.980
 romantics that manifest themselves in 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.310
 repeated times they can be something 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.890
 heavy and repetitive this anime consists 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.380
 of 26 episodes there is also a 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.000
 movie as a spin-off which is 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.610
 a good attempt to take up the story 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.160
 with some changes of the format 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.320
 You can also find this anime in 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.360
 Latin Spanish version being in 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.070
 generally a good adaptation and that 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.740
 I recommend as an option to consider 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.720
 to see this anime the vision of ska 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.000
 flow is a magnificent work 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.560
 that hints at future plans and 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.330
 the way they are rise would go 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.760
 Experiencing looking for new 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.890
 creative horizons that's why the 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.870
 escarlón vision is a work that deserves 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.270
 It's really worth it, because the quality is a 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.680
 constant that is very present in each 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.020
 one of the elements that compose it 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.759
 I say goodbye not without first remembering that I 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.759
 I'm the jerry and I'm not kawaii
