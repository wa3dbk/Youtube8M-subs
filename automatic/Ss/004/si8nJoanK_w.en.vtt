to say the MSI z97 gaming 5 motherboard

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.150 
to say the MSI z97 gaming 5 motherboard
looks<00:01:20.399> really<00:01:21.179> really<00:01:21.660> nice<00:01:21.929> in<00:01:22.170> person<00:01:22.200> much

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
looks really really nice in person much

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.639 
looks really really nice in person much
better<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.910> photo<00:01:24.209> the<00:01:24.780> boards<00:01:25.170> layout

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
better than on a photo the boards layout

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.589 
better than on a photo the boards layout
seems<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.069> be<00:01:26.160> done<00:01:26.429> very<00:01:26.819> well<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.240> first

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
seems to be done very well on first

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.809 
seems to be done very well on first
sight<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.590> red<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.099> black<00:01:29.220> color<00:01:29.520> theme

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.570 
sight and the red and black color theme
really<00:01:30.360> looks<00:01:30.599> fantastic<00:01:31.440> this<00:01:32.009> board<00:01:32.340> for

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
really looks fantastic this board for

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.180 
really looks fantastic this board for
its<00:01:32.670> price<00:01:32.970> class<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.569> very<00:01:34.229> heavy<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> that's

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
its price class is very heavy and that's

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.309 
its price class is very heavy and that's
good<00:01:35.459> because<00:01:35.819> high<00:01:36.149> quality<00:01:36.750> heat<00:01:36.929> sinks<00:01:37.170> are

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
good because high quality heat sinks are

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.680 
good because high quality heat sinks are
used<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:38.069> let's<00:01:38.429> take<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> closer<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.209> at<00:01:39.599> the

phase-- power design which would be
pretty<00:01:54.450> good<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.899> overclocking<00:01:55.489> especially

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:56.489 
pretty good for overclocking especially

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.150 
pretty good for overclocking especially
because<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.970> newer<00:01:57.270> Intel<00:01:57.750> CPUs<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.860> have
