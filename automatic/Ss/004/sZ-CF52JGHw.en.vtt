00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.200 

so<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.829> first<00:00:02.040> of<00:00:02.310> my<00:00:02.550> solar<00:00:02.939> heat

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
so this is the first of my solar heat

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.820 
so this is the first of my solar heat
collectors<00:00:03.659> that<00:00:03.840> I've<00:00:03.990> got<00:00:04.140> assembled<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
collectors that I've got assembled and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.920 
collectors that I've got assembled and
I've<00:00:05.490> got<00:00:05.640> this<00:00:05.790> one<00:00:06.000> configured<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.750> such<00:00:06.779> a

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
I've got this one configured in such a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.589 
I've got this one configured in such a
way<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:08.250> could<00:00:08.490> actually<00:00:08.610> make<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.150> mobile

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
way that I could actually make it mobile

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.740 
way that I could actually make it mobile
and<00:00:10.610> there's<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.670> quite<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> variety<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> ways<00:00:12.719> to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and there's a quite a variety of ways to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
and there's a quite a variety of ways to
put<00:00:13.410> these<00:00:13.530> frames<00:00:13.860> together<00:00:14.219> well<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> got

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
put these frames together well I got

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.109 
put these frames together well I got
some<00:00:15.089> casters<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> front<00:00:16.049> there<00:00:16.230> guys<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
some casters in the front there guys and

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.000 
some casters in the front there guys and
some<00:00:18.119> wheels<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> back<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:18.990> too<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
some wheels in the back here too so I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
some wheels in the back here too so I
made<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.699> little<00:00:21.029> pieces<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.630> today

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
made up these little pieces here today

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
made up these little pieces here today
so<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> could<00:00:23.369> mount<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> wheels<00:00:24.689> on

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so that I could mount the wheels on

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.300 
so that I could mount the wheels on
there<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.710> whole<00:00:25.740> these<00:00:26.039> little

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
there and then the whole these little

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.120 
there and then the whole these little
pieces<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.539> removable<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
pieces are just you know removable but

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.550 
pieces are just you know removable but
the<00:00:29.670> idea<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.750> some<00:00:30.960> experimenting

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the idea is to do some experimenting

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.660 
the idea is to do some experimenting
with<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.239> collector<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> especially<00:00:35.370> quite

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
with this collector and especially quite

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.270 
with this collector and especially quite
a<00:00:35.700> large<00:00:35.910> unit<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.110> well<00:00:37.770> over<00:00:38.040> six

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
a large unit you know it's well over six

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.900 
a large unit you know it's well over six
feet<00:00:38.460> tall

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
feet tall

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.650 
feet tall
it's<00:00:39.690> probably<00:00:40.250> about<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> size<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.090> garage

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
it's probably about the size of a garage

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
it's probably about the size of a garage
door<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> picture<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
door you know a kind of picture that

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.110 
door you know a kind of picture that
kind<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> size<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.910> some

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
kind of size and so I want to do some

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.110 
kind of size and so I want to do some
experimenting<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.960> fin<00:00:49.559> tube<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.129> this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
experimenting with fin tube on this

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
experimenting with fin tube on this
thing<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.440> rolling<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.890> in

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
thing so I'm going to be rolling it in

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.060 
thing so I'm going to be rolling it in
and<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> shop<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:54.449> different

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wheels well that's a dolly that I use to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.469 
wheels well that's a dolly that I use to
move<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> machine<00:01:24.750> around<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.759> arm

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
move the machine around so the a arm

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
move the machine around so the a arm
where<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> wheel<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.909> over<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.119> on

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
where the wheel would go is over here on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.800 
where the wheel would go is over here on
the<00:01:30.450> left<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.619> anyways<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.340> guys<00:01:32.810> it's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the left but anyways so guys it's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
the left but anyways so guys it's
sitting<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.770> its<00:01:34.979> own<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> back<00:01:35.579> at

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
sitting up on its own in the back at

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.109 
sitting up on its own in the back at
least<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> that's<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.430> shock<00:01:38.700> towers

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
least so that's all those shock towers

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
least so that's all those shock towers
turned<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.979> I'm<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> back<00:01:41.520> up

guys remember that big honking piece of
cardboard<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.740> had<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.430> well<00:01:53.909> that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
cardboard I had back here well that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.319 
cardboard I had back here well that
thing<00:01:54.210> came<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.720> handy<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:56.329> figuring

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
thing came in pretty handy for figuring

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.130 
thing came in pretty handy for figuring
out<00:01:57.540> where<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.409> top<00:01:58.950> shock<00:01:59.280> mount<00:01:59.549> should<00:01:59.939> go

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
out where that top shock mount should go

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
out where that top shock mount should go
and<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> did<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.890> made<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.610> first<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and what I did is I made these first and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.170 
and what I did is I made these first and
I<00:02:04.079> welded<00:02:04.649> them<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:04.920> onto<00:02:05.159> some<00:02:05.610> short<00:02:05.850> pieces

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
I welded them up onto some short pieces

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.749 
I welded them up onto some short pieces
of<00:02:06.299> tubing<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.099> used<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.610> cardboard

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
of tubing and then I used that cardboard

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.720 
of tubing and then I used that cardboard
as<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.899> jig<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.230> literally<00:02:11.650> hold<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.430> little

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
as a jig to literally hold that little

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.199 
as a jig to literally hold that little
piece<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.269> place<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.340> then<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> got<00:02:15.939> some

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
piece in place and and then I got some

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.830 
piece in place and and then I got some
short<00:02:16.810> pieces<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.920> em<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:19.209> bent<00:02:19.510> them<00:02:19.689> on

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
short pieces of do em and I bent them on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.670 
short pieces of do em and I bent them on
my<00:02:20.400> cheapy<00:02:21.400> bender<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:23.019> cut<00:02:23.200> them<00:02:23.290> off<00:02:23.470> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
my cheapy bender and I cut them off and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.080 
my cheapy bender and I cut them off and
then<00:02:23.829> started<00:02:24.340> welding<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.730> stuff<00:02:24.939> together

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
then started welding and stuff together

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
then started welding and stuff together
so<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:28.000> know<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.780> way<00:02:28.900> those

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
so you know I really like the way those

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.110 
so you know I really like the way those
shock<00:02:29.470> towers<00:02:29.860> turned<00:02:30.129> out<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.519> back<00:02:30.760> here

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
shock towers turned out in the back here

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.899 
shock towers turned out in the back here
and<00:02:31.269> if<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.319> look<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.709> front<00:02:32.950> there's

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
and if you look in the front there's

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.899 
and if you look in the front there's
actually<00:02:34.329> something<00:02:34.599> missing<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.879> know

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
actually something missing and you know

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.199 
actually something missing and you know
I<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.109> way<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.400> rear<00:02:39.579> shock<00:02:39.849> towers

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
I like the way the the rear shock towers

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.479 
I like the way the the rear shock towers
turned<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:40.930> much<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.439> I<00:02:42.099> was<00:02:42.190> kind<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
turned out so much that I was kind of

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.720 
turned out so much that I was kind of
sorry<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.180> didn't<00:02:43.799> build<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.980> front<00:02:45.250> like

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
sorry that I didn't build the front like

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.030 
sorry that I didn't build the front like
I<00:02:45.849> did<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> back<00:02:46.359> and<00:02:46.659> so<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.590> front<00:02:47.859> was

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
I did the back and so the front was

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.399 
I did the back and so the front was
totally<00:02:48.670> functional<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:49.810> shock<00:02:50.019> towers

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
totally functional like the shock towers

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.729 
totally functional like the shock towers
but<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:52.019> didn't<00:02:53.019> like<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.349> they<00:02:53.500> looked

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
but I didn't like the way they looked

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.990 
but I didn't like the way they looked
and<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.879> I<00:02:54.909> cut<00:02:55.540> him<00:02:55.569> off<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.970> I

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
and so I cut him off of there and so I

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.750 
and so I cut him off of there and so I
got<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.930> know<00:02:58.989> come<00:02:59.319> up<00:02:59.349> with<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.760> another

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
got a you know come up with a another

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.160 
got a you know come up with a another
set<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.299> front<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.720> I'm<00:03:01.810> gonna<00:03:01.900> try<00:03:02.139> and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
set for the front and I'm gonna try and

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.619 
set for the front and I'm gonna try and
match<00:03:02.470> more<00:03:03.159> like<00:03:03.459> what<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:03.970> had<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.420> back

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
match more like what I had in the back

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.559 
match more like what I had in the back
here<00:03:04.930> what<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.750> last<00:03:07.930> kind<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.349> idea<00:03:08.769> so<00:03:09.569> these

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
here what the last kind of idea so these

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.569 
here what the last kind of idea so these
shocks<00:03:10.810> are<00:03:11.019> adjustable<00:03:11.620> obviously<00:03:12.340> with<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
shocks are adjustable obviously with the

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.259 
shocks are adjustable obviously with the
pressure<00:03:12.849> but<00:03:13.629> also<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.760> set<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
pressure but also with the I can set the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.720 
pressure but also with the I can set the
compression<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.319> rebound<00:03:17.590> damping<00:03:18.129> on<00:03:18.549> these

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
compression and rebound damping on these

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.909 
compression and rebound damping on these
things<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.049> take<00:03:20.199> them<00:03:20.379> apart<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.799> do

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
things I have to take them apart to do

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.430 
things I have to take them apart to do
that<00:03:21.129> but<00:03:21.819> that<00:03:22.030> wouldn't<00:03:22.329> really<00:03:22.389> be<00:03:22.510> kind<00:03:23.049> of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
that but that wouldn't really be kind of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.460 
that but that wouldn't really be kind of
a<00:03:23.879> project<00:03:24.879> Missy<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.449> can<00:03:25.629> just<00:03:26.109> let<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.319> bit

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
a project Missy if I can just let a bit

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.099 
a project Missy if I can just let a bit
of<00:03:26.560> pressure<00:03:26.709> out<00:03:26.889> of<00:03:27.010> here<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:28.269> drop<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> bit

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
of pressure out of here just drop a bit

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.319 
of pressure out of here just drop a bit
for<00:03:29.319> you<00:03:29.379> and<00:03:29.709> show<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.370> how<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.669> works<00:03:30.790> I'm

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
for you and show you how it works I'm

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.680 
for you and show you how it works I'm
gonna<00:03:31.389> find<00:03:31.720> something<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.109> do<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:33.510> put<00:03:34.510> a

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
gonna find something to do that put a

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.500 
gonna find something to do that put a
spark<00:03:34.989> plug

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.140 

do<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.599> see<00:03:40.840> drops<00:03:41.109> lay<00:03:41.379> away<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.609> yeah<00:03:43.030> I'm

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
do you see drops lay away so yeah I'm

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.580 
do you see drops lay away so yeah I'm
gonna<00:03:43.269> put<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.569> gauge<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.959> now<00:03:44.169> we'll<00:03:44.319> see<00:03:44.470> we

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
gonna put the gauge on now we'll see we

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.409 
gonna put the gauge on now we'll see we
got<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.859> there<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.760> I<00:03:48.790> have<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.000> check<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
got in there so I have to check this

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.390 
got in there so I have to check this
pretty<00:03:49.629> quick<00:03:49.930> otherwise<00:03:50.739> they<00:03:51.010> let<00:03:51.160> pressure

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
pretty quick otherwise they let pressure

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.399 
pretty quick otherwise they let pressure
out<00:03:51.609> of<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.760> shock<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:53.470> alright<00:03:53.859> now<00:03:55.409> it's

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
out of the shock it's alright now it's

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.610 
out of the shock it's alright now it's
just<00:03:56.590> over<00:03:56.799> 400<00:03:57.250> pounds<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.970> think<00:03:58.870> normally<00:03:59.470> if

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
just over 400 pounds I think normally if

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.899 
just over 400 pounds I think normally if
