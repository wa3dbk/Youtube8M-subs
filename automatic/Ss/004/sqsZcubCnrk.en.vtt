first<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.070> need<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.300> take<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> top<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
first we need to take the top out of the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.970 
first we need to take the top out of the
tree<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.870> any<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.260> cutting<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.739> tree

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
tree and any time you're cutting a tree

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.620 
tree and any time you're cutting a tree
you<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.820> careful<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
you have to be a little careful that you

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.780 
you have to be a little careful that you
don't<00:00:51.809> peel<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> part<00:00:52.860> down<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> crease<00:00:53.610> so

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
don't peel the part down the crease so

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.819 
don't peel the part down the crease so
we're<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:54.329> cut<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> about<00:00:55.350> halfway

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we're going to back cut it about halfway

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.930 
we're going to back cut it about halfway
and<00:00:57.230> once<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.620> about<00:00:59.489> halfway<00:00:59.760> through

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and once we get about halfway through

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
and once we get about halfway through
we're<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.450> to<00:01:00.540> move<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> other<00:01:01.140> side

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
we're going to move to the other side

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
we're going to move to the other side
and<00:01:03.739> finish<00:01:04.739> our<00:01:04.949> cut<00:01:08.119> especially<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and finish our cut especially on the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.780 
and finish our cut especially on the
trees<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.440> three<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> four<00:01:11.100> inches<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
trees that are three to four inches in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.940 
trees that are three to four inches in
diameter<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.470> careful<00:01:13.890> because

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
diameter we have to be careful because

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
diameter we have to be careful because
we<00:01:14.190> can<00:01:14.369> peel<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.729> bark<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.450> trunk<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
we can peel this bark down the trunk and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.219 
we can peel this bark down the trunk and
then<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.320> tree<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:18.080> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> be

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
then your tree is not going to be

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
then your tree is not going to be
suitable<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.680> grafting<00:01:20.340> once<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
suitable for grafting once we get the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.750 
suitable for grafting once we get the
top<00:01:21.780> cut<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.260> we<00:01:22.530> need<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.890> select<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.400> piece<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
top cut off we need to select a piece of

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.789 
top cut off we need to select a piece of
wood<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:26.119> this<00:01:27.119> bark<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:28.170> thick<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
wood and this bark is a little thick so

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.149 
wood and this bark is a little thick so
we<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> thin<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.580> down<00:01:29.760> slightly<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.159> we

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
we want to thin it down slightly and we

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
we want to thin it down slightly and we
have<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> careful<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> go<00:01:33.360> through<00:01:33.720> too

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
have to be careful not to go through too

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.070 
have to be careful not to go through too
deep<00:01:34.710> or<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.130> through<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> cambium<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.689> just

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
deep or go through the cambium but just

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.240 
deep or go through the cambium but just
to<00:01:38.070> make<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.930> where<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:39.960> easier<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to make it where it's easier to get a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
to make it where it's easier to get a
good<00:01:41.490> fit<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:42.290> with<00:01:43.290> our<00:01:43.320> grass<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.369> if

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
good fit with our with our grass and if

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.810 
good fit with our with our grass and if
you<00:01:44.700> look<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.509> top<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
you look from the top you can see the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
you look from the top you can see the
cambium<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.170> darker<00:01:49.619> yes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
cambium is a little bit darker yes

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.899 
cambium is a little bit darker yes
action<00:01:50.490> it'll<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.500> right<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.310> we'd<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
action it'll be right and we'd like to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
action it'll be right and we'd like to
have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> piece<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.630> wood<00:01:54.780> that's<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.350> six

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
have a piece of wood that's about six

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490 
have a piece of wood that's about six
inches<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.340> length<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.930> our<00:01:58.110> pattern

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
inches in length and we make our pattern

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.480 
inches in length and we make our pattern
cut<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:59.009> two<00:01:59.070> inches<00:01:59.579> long<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
cut about two inches long and the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.719 
cut about two inches long and the
smoother<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.960> get<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.320> cut<00:02:04.729> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
smoother that we can get this cut the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
smoother that we can get this cut the
more<00:02:05.939> chances<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.990> graft<00:02:07.350> will

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
more chances are that this graft will

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.679 
more chances are that this graft will
grow<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.610> want<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> good<00:02:09.269> smooth

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:09.689 
grow so what we want is a good smooth

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.080 
grow so what we want is a good smooth
surface<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.310> we're<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> turn<00:02:11.909> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
surface here and we're going to turn the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.449 
surface here and we're going to turn the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
a little bit on the sides and you're

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690 
a little bit on the sides and you're
going<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> expose<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.950> bit<00:02:21.190> more<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
going to expose a little bit more of the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.730 
going to expose a little bit more of the
cambium<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.930> right<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> edge

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
cambium which is right here on the edge

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.130 
cambium which is right here on the edge
and<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.819> most<00:02:25.000> important<00:02:25.630> part<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.990> this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and the most important part of this

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.330 
and the most important part of this
graft<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.069> get<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.459> good<00:02:27.819> tight<00:02:28.180> fit<00:02:28.319> on

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.980 
graft is to get a good tight fit on
either<00:02:30.340> side<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.940> want<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> make<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> cut<00:02:31.780> down

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
either side we want to make a cut down

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.880 
either side we want to make a cut down
about<00:02:32.230> one<00:02:32.950> inch<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.690> either<00:02:34.690> side<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.470> then

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
about one inch on either side and then

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.600 
about one inch on either side and then
we<00:02:36.069> remove<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.910> graft<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.660> make<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> little

we remove the graft and make a little

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.420 
we remove the graft and make a little
expansion<00:02:39.610> joint<00:02:40.150> right<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> middle<00:02:41.430> then

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
grass the next step is we want to use a

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.500 
grass the next step is we want to use a
piece<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:48.070> we<00:04:49.070> use<00:04:49.250> one-inch<00:04:49.670> masking<00:04:50.270> tape

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
piece of we use one-inch masking tape

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.830 
piece of we use one-inch masking tape
and<00:04:51.470> we<00:04:51.650> tape<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:52.130> bottom<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:53.480> hold<00:04:53.630> the

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
and we tape the bottom to hold the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.020 
and we tape the bottom to hold the
bottom<00:04:54.170> of<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.350> bag<00:04:54.560> secure<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.060> tree<00:04:58.030> the

bottom of the bag secure to the tree the
next<00:04:59.240> step<00:04:59.570> that<00:04:59.600> we're<00:04:59.900> going<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.140> do<00:05:00.320> is

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
next step that we're going to do is

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.120 
next step that we're going to do is
we're<00:05:01.070> going<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.310> use<00:05:01.550> what<00:05:01.850> we<00:05:01.880> call<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:03.680> bird

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
we're going to use what we call a bird

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.230 
we're going to use what we call a bird
perch<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:05.170> will<00:05:06.170> help<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.560> protect<00:05:07.090> from<00:05:08.090> a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
perch that will help to protect from a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.300 
perch that will help to protect from a
bird<00:05:08.450> coming<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.290> lighting<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.950> graft

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
bird coming in and lighting on the graft

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.910 
bird coming in and lighting on the graft
that<00:05:10.640> could<00:05:11.120> enjoy<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.720> graft<00:05:12.050> loose<00:05:12.470> in<00:05:12.800> the

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
that could enjoy the graft loose in the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.510 
that could enjoy the graft loose in the
tree<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:14.330> we're<00:05:14.540> going<00:05:14.720> to<00:05:14.810> tape<00:05:15.050> this<00:05:15.290> on<00:05:15.590> and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.350 

it<00:05:19.520> also<00:05:19.730> makes<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.630> good<00:05:21.140> place<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.440> anchor<00:05:21.920> or

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
it also makes a good place to anchor or

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.810 
it also makes a good place to anchor or
our<00:05:23.360> new<00:05:24.020> growth<00:05:24.380> on<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.830> graft<00:05:25.130> when<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:25.610> gets

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
our new growth on the graft when it gets

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.130 
our new growth on the graft when it gets
up<00:05:26.830> 6<00:05:27.830> 8<00:05:28.040> or<00:05:28.310> 10<00:05:28.790> inches<00:05:29.150> tall<00:05:29.420> so<00:05:29.480> that<00:05:29.870> it

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
up 6 8 or 10 inches tall so that it

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.740 
up 6 8 or 10 inches tall so that it
doesn't<00:05:30.560> blow<00:05:30.680> out<00:05:30.950> from<00:05:31.190> a<00:05:31.310> hard<00:05:31.520> wind<00:05:31.820> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
doesn't blow out from a hard wind the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.810 
doesn't blow out from a hard wind the
last<00:05:33.020> step<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.320> we'll<00:05:33.650> do<00:05:33.830> on<00:05:33.980> this<00:05:34.130> graft<00:05:34.520> is

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
last step that we'll do on this graft is

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.350 
last step that we'll do on this graft is
we<00:05:35.060> we<00:05:35.720> use<00:05:35.930> an<00:05:36.110> amber<00:05:36.470> shellac<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:37.280> we<00:05:38.090> paint

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
we we use an amber shellac and we paint

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.740 
we we use an amber shellac and we paint
the<00:05:38.570> whole<00:05:38.810> graft<00:05:39.200> buds<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:39.830> all<00:05:40.300> this<00:05:41.300> helps

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
the whole graft buds and all this helps

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.540 
the whole graft buds and all this helps
to<00:05:41.900> seal<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.260> moisture<00:05:42.440> in<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:42.890> graft<00:05:43.280> and

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
to seal the moisture in the graft and

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.810 
to seal the moisture in the graft and
keeps<00:05:43.790> it<00:05:43.970> from<00:05:44.150> drying<00:05:44.600> out<00:05:46.570> we<00:05:47.570> should<00:05:47.900> see

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
keeps it from drying out we should see

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.970 
keeps it from drying out we should see
the<00:05:49.820> buds<00:05:50.060> swelling<00:05:50.660> within<00:05:50.870> 10<00:05:51.320> days<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.800> two

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
the buds swelling within 10 days to two

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.400 
the buds swelling within 10 days to two
weeks<00:05:52.010> and<00:05:52.550> within<00:05:53.180> three<00:05:53.600> weeks<00:05:53.780> we<00:05:54.020> can<00:05:54.230> see

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
weeks and within three weeks we can see

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.140 
weeks and within three weeks we can see
little<00:05:54.680> leaves<00:05:54.950> starting<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.520> form<00:05:55.790> on<00:05:55.970> this

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
little leaves starting to form on this

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.610 
little leaves starting to form on this
graft<00:05:56.510> so<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:58.490> won't<00:05:58.730> take<00:05:58.820> long<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.450> to<00:06:00.440> know

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
graft so it won't take long to to know

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.900 
graft so it won't take long to to know
when<00:06:00.920> you're<00:06:01.160> going<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.430> have<00:06:01.550> a<00:06:01.610> successful

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
when you're going to have a successful

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.990 
when you're going to have a successful
graft<00:06:02.600> when<00:06:03.230> do<00:06:03.410> you<00:06:03.500> remove<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.220> plastic<00:06:04.790> and

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
graft when do you remove the plastic and

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.660 
graft when do you remove the plastic and
the<00:06:05.240> foil<00:06:05.590> okay<00:06:06.590> normally<00:06:07.070> we'll<00:06:07.220> come<00:06:07.460> back

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
the foil okay normally we'll come back

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.800 
the foil okay normally we'll come back
about<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.240> middle<00:06:08.510> of<00:06:08.630> July<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:10.630> we're<00:06:11.630> going

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
about the middle of July and we're going

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.560 
about the middle of July and we're going
to<00:06:11.840> have<00:06:12.050> some<00:06:12.430> buds<00:06:13.430> breakout<00:06:14.090> up<00:06:14.270> and<00:06:14.450> down

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
to have some buds breakout up and down

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.990 
to have some buds breakout up and down
this<00:06:14.780> trunk<00:06:15.200> we<00:06:15.920> want<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.190> remove<00:06:16.520> some<00:06:16.880> of
