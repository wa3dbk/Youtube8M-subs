00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 not been paid for this event finally 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.940
 the meat expert the wine I know the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.710
 unfortunate appreciate it but I do not have any 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.370
 language on me it suits us the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.750
 pack and true 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.590
 then you can you do us the nose 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.109
 mouth goes by the head 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.109
 I smell a little woody 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.360
 it's confirmed in the mouth 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.110
 enough confidence and well-wooded one is 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.429
 in the wood so it's quite framing 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.770
 and we can say that it is always 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.909
 in terms of seeing we are nice 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.020
 it's sturdy the first stout enough 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.460
 stay in the mouth for a long time 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.289
 so I like it I think he's going 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.220
 have to give him something next 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.440
 two 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.820
 to give weight so that to hold 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:54.270
 from a distance we are no longer in the fruit 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.270
 I will go 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.340
 I like that more delicate what 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.290
 it can go with a lot of things 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.690
 we can go on roast meats on 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.170

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.100

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.130
 a pot-au-feu and even a bath a 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.830
 good dish in age sauce will have a good 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.160
 broth like that so what I have
