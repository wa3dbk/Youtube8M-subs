00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.580
 aircraft turbine is a complicated mechanism 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.580
 consisting of several parts 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.170
 working together 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:20.369
 central section starts that part 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 engine that creates traction 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.430
 the phenomenon is nothing but the second 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 Newton's law 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.060
 calculated by the formula mass on 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.759
 acceleration it is this force that raises in 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.469
 air aircraft 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.850
 to see how traction is created 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.960
 aircraft engine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.399
 let's look at a specific example 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 the first part of the engine is 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.320
 is a fan 36 meters in diameter 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 tori during takeoff of the plane rotates with 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 speed 280 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 rpm minutes this giant 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 the fan passes through it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.190
 the amount of air you can compare it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.289
 with a hurricane that in half a second could 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 raise a small private house 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 during the movement of air through 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.360
 the fan is divided into two streams 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.229
 and only 15 percent of all air 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.960
 central hydraulic engine hits 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.380
 the remaining 85 percent flow 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 on the outside of the engine getting 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.080
 tapering channels in these channels 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.270
 flow ratio of acceleration occurs 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.670
 air passing through the outside 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.780
 the inside of the engine is called 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 ratio of consumption because those 85 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 percent of air passing through the outside 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.720
 parts 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.850
 create the mainstream meanwhile the rest 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.189
 15 percent of the air gets 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.470
 central part of the engine called 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.570
 low pressure compressor here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.329
 air passing through motionless 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.979
 guide vanes fall onto the vanes 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.840
 compressors that rotate 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.090
 we see several spinning wheels 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.729
 which is steps 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.259
 compress at each compressor stage 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.509
 the air is compressed its pressure and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.930
 temperature rise and after compressor 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.220
 low pressure 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.350
 it hits the high compressor 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.310
 pressure this compressor rotates 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.190
 much faster 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.790
 it is here that the pressure rises to 70 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.160
 percent 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 after passing by air both 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.410
 compressors its pressure rises in 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.420
 35 times and the temperature at 1000 degrees 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.670
 regarding the environment 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.100
 now pressure and temperature flow 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.110
 reached the required value however 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.570
 its speed is too high therefore 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 the flow enters the diffuser where is it 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.610
 speed drops from pressure and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.200
 the temperature remains the same 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.650
 then the air enters the combustion chamber 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.690
 where his energy grows it 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.270
 by fuel injection 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.850
 into the combustion chamber through a series of nozzles 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.380
 here the temperature of the mixture rises 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.300
 600 degrees higher pressure 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.030
 air entering the combustion chamber 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.880
 the more energy is released when burning 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.250
 the more effective the process is for 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.209
 increase the pressure of air entering into 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.580
 combustion chamber 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.320
 used 1 by compressor 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.410
 in front of the engine 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.450
 now a very tight and heated mixture 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.489
 ready for the next stage going through 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.530
 high pressure turbine strongly 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.930
 heated gases unwind it to 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.090
 speeds of 10,000 rpm 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.280
 the drive of this turbine is on the shaft 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.530
 which drives the compressor 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.900
 high pressure optically single 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.940
 The purpose of the high pressure turbine is 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.070
 extracting enough 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.750
 energy from the flow to bring to 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.269
 motion high pressure compressor 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.340
 together compressor and turbine high 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.290
 pressures represent 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.090
 high speed wait day engine 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.950
 Italy air enters the turbine 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.410
 low pressure which has two 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.450
 assignment the first task is to extract 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.910
 enough energy to 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.350
 rotate low pressure compressor 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.140
 front of the engine 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.360
 they are interconnected by a pin which 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.250
 runs inside the high speed shaft 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.380
 steps 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.959
 nevertheless the 2 and most important task 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.459
 low pressure turbines this rotation 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.500
 large titanium fan blades 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.019
 the fan is on the same shaft as 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.870
 and low pressure compressor and turbine 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.079
 all together these three components 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.340
 make up on 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.500
 tale once becomes a rung 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.930
 aviation engine and finally 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.479
 the combustion products exits through the nozzle 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.490
 aft engine 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.620
 purchasing here an extra 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.250
 acceleration gas discharged from the outlet 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.340
 nozzles 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.530
 creates jet thrust and thrust from 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.870
 the exhaust flow is only 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.759
 20 percent of all engine thrust 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.250
 the rest of the traction is created 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.500
 air flow blower fan 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.500
 and passing through the outside of the engine
