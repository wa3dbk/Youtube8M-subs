and by the way resistance is in a

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.950 
and by the way resistance is in a
fantastic<00:00:08.639> map<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.540> pretty<00:00:09.750> much<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
fantastic map and it's pretty much the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.390 
fantastic map and it's pretty much the
perfect<00:00:10.050> map<00:00:10.440> for<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.800> gun<00:00:10.980> i'm<00:00:11.099> using<00:00:11.370> here

and it's probably my favorite maps to be

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.629 
and it's probably my favorite maps to be
fair<00:00:13.410> i<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.830> mission<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.549> like

try<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.510> map<00:00:18.690> because<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> really<00:00:19.170> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
try get this map because it really is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.439 
try get this map because it really is
very<00:00:19.350> good<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.400> quite<00:00:20.550> plain<00:00:20.850> as<00:00:21.390> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
very good because it's quite plain as a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
very good because it's quite plain as a
lot<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> hallways<00:00:22.680> lot<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.100> long

lot of a lot of hallways lot of long

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.340 
lot of a lot of hallways lot of long
lines<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.580> sight<00:00:23.789> hello<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> lot<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> maps

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
lines of sight hello a lot of the maps

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.620 
lines of sight hello a lot of the maps
are<00:00:25.439> very<00:00:25.650> close<00:00:25.859> range<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:27.599> are

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
are very close range now and there are

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.650 
are very close range now and there are
no<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:28.140> wasteland<00:00:28.769> maps<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.340> any-any<00:00:30.060> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
no like wasteland maps or any-any really

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.840 
no like wasteland maps or any-any really
large<00:00:30.840> map<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.590> good<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> when

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
large map so that's good to see but when

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
large map so that's good to see but when
you're<00:00:32.940> using<00:00:33.059> assault<00:00:33.390> rifle<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.260> need<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
you're using assault rifle you need that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680 
you're using assault rifle you need that
little<00:00:34.680> bit<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.010> extra<00:00:35.130> rope<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.730> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
little bit of extra rope a little bit of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
little bit of extra rope a little bit of
extra<00:00:36.870> range<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.070> close

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
extra range because if it's all close

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
extra range because if it's all close
range<00:00:38.460> much<00:00:38.640> well<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> submachine<00:00:39.629> know

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
range much well use a submachine know

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
range much well use a submachine know
it's<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.079> better<00:00:40.260> than<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.379> sort<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> thing

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
it's me better than that sort of thing

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's me better than that sort of thing
so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.910> ak-47<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> gun<00:00:43.320> i'm

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
so the ak-47 this is the gun i'm

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
so the ak-47 this is the gun i'm
reviewing<00:00:44.010> today<00:00:44.250> by<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.539> can

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
reviewing today by the way as you can

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
reviewing today by the way as you can
see<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.899> i'm<00:00:45.989> raping<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
see and i'm raping with it here by the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.470 
see and i'm raping with it here by the
way<00:00:47.250> i<00:00:47.280> didn't<00:00:47.520> have<00:00:47.610> anything<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
way i didn't have anything on this this

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.670 
way i didn't have anything on this this
is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.899> time<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.230> looks<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.469> just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is the first time I looks you just

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.470 
is the first time I looks you just
unlocked<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> first<00:00:51.360> time

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
unlocked it and this is the first time

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.000 
unlocked it and this is the first time
I'm<00:00:51.570> actually<00:00:51.629> used<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> haven't<00:00:52.829> got

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I'm actually used it so I haven't got

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
I'm actually used it so I haven't got
like<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.489> efficiency<00:00:53.850> kick<00:00:54.390> giving<00:00:54.899> less

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
like that efficiency kick giving less

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
like that efficiency kick giving less
recoil<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> looks<00:00:55.890> pretty<00:00:56.250> refunding<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
recoil so it looks pretty refunding this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
recoil so it looks pretty refunding this
video<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.710> definitely<00:00:58.739> less<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
video but there is definitely less in

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.110 
video but there is definitely less in
real<00:00:59.489> life<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.949> yeah<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.579> tip<00:01:03.059> number

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
real life and yeah so that's tip number

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.479 
real life and yeah so that's tip number
one<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.019> well<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> eventually<00:01:05.189> did

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
one if you well when you eventually did

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.039 
one if you well when you eventually did
not<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.729> gonna<00:01:05.880> thing<00:01:06.030> 68<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> didn't

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
not was gonna thing 68 if you didn't

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.530 
not was gonna thing 68 if you didn't
know<00:01:07.760> definitely<00:01:08.760> used<00:01:08.909> kick<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
know definitely used kick as the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
know definitely used kick as the
proficiency<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.260> nothing<00:01:10.770> else<00:01:10.890> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
proficiency there is nothing else that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.109 
proficiency there is nothing else that
really<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.549> give<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.000> an

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
really gonna give you that much an

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.480 
really gonna give you that much an
advantage<00:01:12.540> rather<00:01:12.720> than<00:01:12.840> kick<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> don't<00:01:14.369> use

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
advantage rather than kick and don't use

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.190 
advantage rather than kick and don't use
a<00:01:14.520> silencer<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.330> opinion<00:01:15.570> because<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
a silencer in my opinion because it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
a silencer in my opinion because it
seems<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> take<00:01:16.650> away<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> damage<00:01:17.729> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
seems to take away a lot of the damage I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.770 
seems to take away a lot of the damage I
know<00:01:17.909> doesn't<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.240> damage<00:01:18.420> takes<00:01:18.659> away

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
know doesn't take damage takes away

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
know doesn't take damage takes away
range<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:20.070> seemed<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> struggle<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> lot

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
range but it seemed to struggle a lot

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.980 
range but it seemed to struggle a lot
more<00:01:20.820> using<00:01:21.090> science<00:01:21.330> wins<00:01:21.479> game<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
more using science wins game and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
more using science wins game and
generally<00:01:22.650> silences<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.159> general<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.549> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
generally silences in general on this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
generally silences in general on this
game<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> seems<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> massive

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
game it but it seems to a massive

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
game it but it seems to a massive
difference<00:01:25.590> between<00:01:26.130> using<00:01:26.280> Santa<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
difference between using Santa and not

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.880 
difference between using Santa and not
like<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.229> gun<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like I think the only gun that can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
like I think the only gun that can
really<00:01:29.070> stay<00:01:29.549> immune<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.000> fact<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
really stay immune to that fact is the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
really stay immune to that fact is the
UMP<00:01:30.990> cuz<00:01:31.229> still<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.799> overpowered<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
UMP cuz still think it's overpowered I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
UMP cuz still think it's overpowered I
mean<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:32.970> definitely<00:01:33.090> padam<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.720> 42<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
mean it would definitely padam or 42 and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
mean it would definitely padam or 42 and
it's<00:01:34.290> Stephanie<00:01:34.619> maybe<00:01:35.310> not<00:01:35.430> overpower<00:01:35.820> but

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
it's Stephanie maybe not overpower but

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.670 
it's Stephanie maybe not overpower but
it's<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> most<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> most<00:01:37.079> dominant<00:01:37.439> gun

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it's the most it's the most dominant gun

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219 
it's the most it's the most dominant gun
I<00:01:37.860> mean<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:39.479> least<00:01:39.600> fifty<00:01:39.930> percent<00:01:40.110> of

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
not the best thing for TDM because it's

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.770

not<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.359> but<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.689> you're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780

you<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.329> control<00:02:45.659> it<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.109> didn't

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
you can control it but I didn't

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.319 
you can control it but I didn't

they've<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.639> is<00:03:14.760> crap<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.299> mean<00:03:15.510> I'm<00:03:15.629> sorry<00:03:15.900> but

the<00:03:16.290> ACR<00:03:16.799> apparently<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.310> pretty<00:03:17.639> much<00:03:17.729> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
the ACR apparently is pretty much the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.990 
the ACR apparently is pretty much the
same<00:03:18.030> damage<00:03:18.329> as<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.579> ak-47<00:03:20.579> but<00:03:20.669> i<00:03:20.699> think<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
same damage as the ak-47 but i think the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390 
same damage as the ak-47 but i think the
ACR<00:03:21.419> spits<00:03:22.019> out<00:03:22.169> frickin<00:03:22.500> paper<00:03:22.739> i<00:03:23.099> mean<00:03:23.370> i

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
ACR spits out frickin paper i mean i

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.860

going<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.299> be<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.389> mid-range<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:18.930> clever

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
going to be a mid-range and the clever

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.140 
going to be a mid-range and the clever
dish<00:04:19.320> did<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.799> minute<00:04:20.070> ago<00:04:20.190> ready<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:20.849> show<00:04:21.000> it

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
dish did a minute ago ready to show it

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.580 
dish did a minute ago ready to show it
and<00:04:21.299> because<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.570> has<00:04:21.690> high<00:04:21.840> power<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.440> good

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and because it has high power and good

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.680 
and because it has high power and good
accuracy<00:04:22.889> as<00:04:23.219> you<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.490> see<00:04:23.610> i'm<00:04:23.760> beating<00:04:24.000> UMP

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
accuracy as you can see i'm beating UMP

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.230 
accuracy as you can see i'm beating UMP
sort<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.900> range<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.400> ak-47<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.060> one<00:04:27.180> of

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
sort of range so the ak-47 is one of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.510 
sort of range so the ak-47 is one of
those<00:04:27.330> really<00:04:27.810> versatile<00:04:28.440> like<00:04:29.040> fast

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
those really versatile like fast

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.460 
those really versatile like fast
shooting<00:04:29.790> gun<00:04:30.090> nashik<00:04:30.750> names<00:04:30.930> are<00:04:31.110> powerful

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
shooting gun nashik names are powerful

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.990 
shooting gun nashik names are powerful
guns<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:31.710> I'm<00:04:31.740> 142<00:04:32.160> there<00:04:32.370> was<00:04:32.460> an<00:04:32.550> atar<00:04:32.790> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
guns but I'm 142 there was an atar that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.090 
guns but I'm 142 there was an atar that
could<00:04:33.120> do<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.600> obviously<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.350> ak-47

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
could do this and obviously the ak-47

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.940 
could do this and obviously the ak-47
but<00:04:35.910> its<00:04:36.300> dominant<00:04:37.080> over<00:04:37.200> mid<00:04:37.380> range<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.890> you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
but its dominant over mid range and you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.740 
but its dominant over mid range and you
want<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.400> be<00:04:38.460> careful<00:04:38.580> what<00:04:38.850> maps<00:04:39.060> using<00:04:39.330> on<00:04:39.540> I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
want to be careful what maps using on I

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.720 
want to be careful what maps using on I
mean<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:39.990> map<00:04:40.170> works<00:04:40.350> well<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:40.980> on<00:04:41.550> some

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
mean this map works well but and on some

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.850 
mean this map works well but and on some
of<00:04:41.790> the<00:04:41.880> maps<00:04:42.030> there<00:04:42.480> the<00:04:42.930> longer<00:04:43.260> ranges<00:04:43.620> and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
of the maps there the longer ranges and

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.380 
of the maps there the longer ranges and
as<00:04:43.980> you<00:04:44.040> can<00:04:44.160> see<00:04:44.190> here<00:04:44.670> I'm<00:04:45.120> gonna<00:04:45.210> do

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
as you can see here I'm gonna do

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.090 
as you can see here I'm gonna do
struggle<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.780> get<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.990> kill<00:04:46.230> but<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.950> shows

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
struggle to get that kill but that shows

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.170 
struggle to get that kill but that shows
the<00:04:47.310> power<00:04:47.460> you<00:04:47.640> want<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.820> try<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.000> keep<00:04:48.060> this

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
the power you want to try and keep this

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.030 
the power you want to try and keep this
thing<00:04:48.330> at<00:04:48.450> mid-range<00:04:48.650> if<00:04:49.650> you're<00:04:49.830> shooting

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
thing at mid-range if you're shooting

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.250 
thing at mid-range if you're shooting
people<00:04:50.370> long<00:04:50.550> range<00:04:50.820> I<00:04:51.060> mean<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.990> can<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.200> a

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
people long range I mean you can have a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.050 
people long range I mean you can have a
hard<00:04:52.440> time<00:04:52.620> because<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.010> recall<00:04:53.610> is<00:04:53.730> quite<00:04:54.030> a

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
hard time because the recall is quite a

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.250 
hard time because the recall is quite a
lot<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.740> ultimately<00:04:56.360> likely<00:04:57.360> 47<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:57.990> great

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
lot so ultimately likely 47 is a great

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.600 
lot so ultimately likely 47 is a great
gun<00:04:58.470> I'm<00:04:58.560> gonna<00:04:58.620> give<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.980> rushed<00:04:59.250> rating

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610

100 I'm gonna give it a 75 / pelvis guns
brilliant<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:06.150> really<00:05:06.360> do<00:05:06.540> after<00:05:06.840> you

right circumstances because if you're
all<00:05:10.890> persons<00:05:11.190> rushing<00:05:11.430> around<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.760> keeping

in that small small zone sleeping there

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.850 
in that small small zone sleeping there
like<00:05:14.760> a<00:05:14.790> close<00:05:15.150> call<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.690> situation<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:16.710> mean

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
like a close call the situation I mean

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.720 
like a close call the situation I mean
you<00:05:16.920> might<00:05:17.010> so<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.250> use<00:05:17.370> something<00:05:17.550> like<00:05:17.580> the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
you might so you use something like the

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.090 
you might so you use something like the
UFP<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.210> p90<00:05:18.780> or<00:05:19.440> one<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.770> fastest

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
to be better close range and if you look

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.410 
to be better close range and if you look
I'm<00:05:23.250> sitting<00:05:23.490> up<00:05:23.580> with<00:05:23.820> a<00:05:23.850> bit<00:05:24.060> more<00:05:24.090> rain

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
I'm sitting up with a bit more rain

I'm sitting up with a bit more rain
shape<00:05:24.750> we<00:05:24.840> try<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.110> pay<00:05:25.230> a<00:05:25.260> bit<00:05:25.440> more

defensively may be defending be flag on
domination<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.080> mean<00:05:28.800> then<00:05:28.919> you<00:05:29.040> might<00:05:29.430> want<00:05:29.460> to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
domination I mean then you might want to

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.040 
domination I mean then you might want to
be<00:05:29.669> using<00:05:29.850> some<00:05:30.000> baskin<00:05:30.419> something<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.020> a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
bit more accuracy of a long-range so

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.250 
bit more accuracy of a long-range so
this<00:05:32.700> gun<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.210> doesn't<00:05:33.630> really<00:05:33.720> fit<00:05:34.080> in

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
this gun it doesn't really fit in

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.650 
this gun it doesn't really fit in
brilliantly<00:05:35.010> but<00:05:35.250> you<00:05:35.370> have<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.730> you<00:05:36.540> have<00:05:36.570> to

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
brilliantly but you have to you have to

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.900 
brilliantly but you have to you have to
try<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:36.960> make<00:05:37.140> it<00:05:37.580> it's<00:05:38.580> one<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.820> more

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
try and make it it's one of the more

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.460 
try and make it it's one of the more
versatile<00:05:39.419> guns<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:39.990> pretty<00:05:40.380> much

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
versatile guns and it's pretty much

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.230 
versatile guns and it's pretty much
unbeatable<00:05:40.680> mid-range<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.850> mean<00:05:41.970> if<00:05:42.060> someone

going to be in the most of the time of
