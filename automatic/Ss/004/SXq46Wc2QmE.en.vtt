00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
little scene here which is very simple

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
little scene here which is very simple
just<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.480> text<00:00:22.039> 3-way<00:00:23.039> lighting<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
go into the camera which is the render

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.200 
go into the camera which is the render
icon<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.350> we're<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.460> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> scroll

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
icon then we're just going to scroll

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.369 
icon then we're just going to scroll
down<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> open<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> shading

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
down and you need to open up the shading

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.369 
down and you need to open up the shading
drop<00:00:46.590> down<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:50.120> make<00:00:51.120> sure<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.629> output<00:00:52.170> drop

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.770 
down is also there so if we want no
background<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.559> our<00:00:58.980> render<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
background at all in our render and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
background at all in our render and
we'll<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.980> transparency<00:01:01.980> throughout<00:01:02.640> then

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
we'll have transparency throughout then

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.140 
we'll have transparency throughout then
first<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.799> let's<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> look<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
first of all let's have a look at it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300 
first of all let's have a look at it
without<00:01:06.540> transparency<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.830> I'll<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.070> click

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
without transparency so I'll just click

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
without transparency so I'll just click
render<00:01:08.520> quickly<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.180> scene<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
render quickly my scene and you see that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
render quickly my scene and you see that
it's<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.020> disgusting<00:01:13.020> horrible<00:01:13.979> not

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

very nice-looking great thing and that's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
very nice-looking great thing and that's
how<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> render<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.380> come<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
how the render will come out so to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.130 
how the render will come out so to
change<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.220> we're<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
change that we're just going to the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
change that we're just going to the
shading<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> change<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> Alpha

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
shading we just need to change the Alpha

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.179 
shading we just need to change the Alpha
to<00:01:27.150> transparent<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> output<00:01:32.009> we

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
to transparent and then the output we

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.350 
to transparent and then the output we
want<00:01:32.369> RGB<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.570> which<00:01:34.439> stands<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.070> red<00:01:35.549> green

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
want RGB a which stands for red green

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.280 
want RGB a which stands for red green
blue<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> alpha<00:01:37.909> which<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.079> transparency<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
blue and alpha which is transparency and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.760 
blue and alpha which is transparency and
when<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.979> render<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.579> again<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.560> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
when we render this again you see it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.149 
when we render this again you see it's
on<00:01:43.890> our<00:01:44.040> checkers<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.450> stands<00:01:45.990> for

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
on our checkers which stands for

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
on our checkers which stands for
transparency<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:48.090> when<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> take<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.750> into

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
transparency so when I take this into

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
transparency so when I take this into
GIMP<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.340> finish<00:01:50.490> rendering

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
GIMP I'll just finish rendering

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.490 
GIMP I'll just finish rendering
I'll<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:52.290> put<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.590> desktop<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> there's<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I'll just put up my desktop so there's a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:08.150 
I'll just put up my desktop so there's a
PNG<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.420> up<00:02:00.420> GIMP<00:02:05.719> just<00:02:06.719> wave<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.899> allude<00:02:07.469> okay

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
PNG and up GIMP just wave it allude okay

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.890 
PNG and up GIMP just wave it allude okay
then<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.729> wanna<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.330> file<00:02:09.830> open

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.170 

open<00:02:15.900> our<00:02:16.020> image<00:02:16.320> up<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:17.400> very<00:02:17.610> big<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:17.850> we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
open our image up not very big but we

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.280 
open our image up not very big but we
can<00:02:18.330> make<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> bigger<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:20.480> then<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.840> make<00:02:21.990> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
can make it bigger and then I can make a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.180 
can make it bigger and then I can make a
new<00:02:22.650> layer<00:02:22.830> behind<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> layer

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
new layer behind it so you see the layer

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160 
new layer behind it so you see the layer
came<00:02:29.520> out<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.970> checkers<00:02:30.630> meaning

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
came out with that checkers meaning

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.410 
came out with that checkers meaning
transparency<00:02:32.010> I'm<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> fill<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
