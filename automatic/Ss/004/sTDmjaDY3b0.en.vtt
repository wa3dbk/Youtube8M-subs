specifically<00:03:43.189> in<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> tail<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.269> acts<00:03:44.479> as

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
specifically in the tail and it acts as

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.229 
specifically in the tail and it acts as
a<00:03:44.720> turbo<00:03:45.349> boost<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.370> ski<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:46.819> tail<00:03:47.030> of

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
a turbo boost to the ski and the tail of

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.119 
a turbo boost to the ski and the tail of
the<00:03:47.329> turn<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.019> we<00:03:48.139> have<00:03:48.259> intelligence<00:03:48.919> which

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
the turn so we have intelligence which

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.129 
the turn so we have intelligence which
really<00:03:49.519> stabilizes<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.479> whole<00:03:50.629> body<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:51.079> the

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
really stabilizes the whole body of the

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.409 
really stabilizes the whole body of the
ski<00:03:51.409> then<00:03:51.949> we<00:03:52.099> have<00:03:52.220> Kerr's<00:03:52.609> technology<00:03:53.269> which

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
ski then we have Kerr's technology which

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.659 
ski then we have Kerr's technology which
is<00:03:53.569> that<00:03:53.720> turbo<00:03:54.169> boost<00:03:54.439> at<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.069> tail<00:03:55.340> end<00:03:55.579> of

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
is that turbo boost at the tail end of

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.999 
is that turbo boost at the tail end of
the<00:03:55.790> scheme<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:57.319> sounds<00:03:57.650> like<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.799> lot<00:03:57.979> of

00:03:57.999 --> 00:03:58.009 
the scheme it sounds like a lot of

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.069 
the scheme it sounds like a lot of
technology<00:03:58.669> but<00:03:58.879> we've<00:03:59.060> actually<00:03:59.299> added<00:03:59.780> more

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
technology but we've actually added more

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.369 
technology but we've actually added more
and<00:04:00.319> that's<00:04:00.739> with<00:04:00.949> a<00:04:00.979> new<00:04:01.189> tri<00:04:01.549> flex<00:04:01.939> plate<00:04:02.379> so

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
and that's with a new tri flex plate so

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.080 
and that's with a new tri flex plate so
talking<00:04:03.739> about<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.040> Tri<00:04:04.310> flex<00:04:04.639> plate<00:04:04.909> which

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
talking about the Tri flex plate which

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.839 
talking about the Tri flex plate which
is<00:04:05.239> new<00:04:05.419> for<00:04:05.449> the<00:04:05.750> 1415<00:04:06.349> super<00:04:06.949> shape<00:04:07.159> line<00:04:07.400> you

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
is new for the 1415 super shape line you

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.509 
is new for the 1415 super shape line you
can<00:04:07.970> take<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.180> good<00:04:08.419> look<00:04:08.629> at<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.870> here<00:04:09.349> and<00:04:09.519> the

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
can take a good look at it here and the

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.759 
can take a good look at it here and the
the<00:04:10.819> plate<00:04:11.060> has<00:04:11.299> been<00:04:11.329> widened<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.139> a<00:04:12.409> better

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
the plate has been widened to a better

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.890 
the plate has been widened to a better
edge<00:04:13.009> pressure<00:04:13.340> directly<00:04:14.180> from<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:14.509> boot<00:04:14.720> to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
edge pressure directly from the boot to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.099 
edge pressure directly from the boot to
the<00:04:14.930> edge<00:04:15.190> we<00:04:16.190> also<00:04:16.459> use<00:04:16.909> a<00:04:16.940> floating<00:04:17.539> system

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
the edge we also use a floating system

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.170 
the edge we also use a floating system
three<00:04:18.859> out<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.219> four<00:04:19.430> sets<00:04:19.729> of<00:04:19.849> screws

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
three out of the four sets of screws

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.480 
three out of the four sets of screws
actually<00:04:20.630> float<00:04:20.989> within<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.469> plate<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
actually float within the plate so the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.230 
actually float within the plate so the
two<00:04:22.669> rear

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
two rear

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.990 
two rear
and<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.900> forward<00:04:24.350> screw<00:04:24.650> actually<00:04:25.370> floats<00:04:25.759> so

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
and the forward screw actually floats so

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.059 
and the forward screw actually floats so
that<00:04:26.150> plate<00:04:26.509> does<00:04:26.750> not<00:04:26.990> inhibit<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.680> Flex<00:04:27.919> of

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
that plate does not inhibit the Flex of

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.460 
that plate does not inhibit the Flex of
the<00:04:28.130> binding<00:04:28.520> at<00:04:28.940> all<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.389> only<00:04:29.690> fixed<00:04:30.080> set<00:04:30.289> is

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
the binding at all the only fixed set is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.189 
the binding at all the only fixed set is
that<00:04:30.889> second<00:04:31.550> set<00:04:31.819> from<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.419> toe<00:04:32.930> of<00:04:33.110> the

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
that second set from the toe of the

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.129 
that second set from the toe of the
plate<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:34.550> we've<00:04:34.699> got<00:04:34.849> a<00:04:34.910> wider<00:04:35.240> lighter<00:04:35.810> plate

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
plate so we've got a wider lighter plate

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.740 
plate so we've got a wider lighter plate
that<00:04:36.410> floats<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.520> more<00:04:37.819> importantly<00:04:38.330> we<00:04:38.539> use

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
that floats but more importantly we use

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.960 
that floats but more importantly we use
a<00:04:38.780> dynamic<00:04:39.229> rebound<00:04:40.039> system<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.729> tail<00:04:40.940> of

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
a dynamic rebound system in the tail of

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.120 
a dynamic rebound system in the tail of
the<00:04:41.210> plate<00:04:41.449> and<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.020> can<00:04:42.199> see<00:04:42.470> these<00:04:42.650> Springs

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
the plate and you can see these Springs

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.040 
the plate and you can see these Springs
right<00:04:43.370> underneath<00:04:43.759> my<00:04:43.970> finger<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.539> those

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
right underneath my finger and those

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.559 
right underneath my finger and those
Springs<00:04:45.440> as<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.160> go<00:04:46.310> through<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.759> turn<00:04:46.970> load

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
Springs as you go through the turn load

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.570 
Springs as you go through the turn load
up<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> tail<00:04:48.740> of<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.009> turn<00:04:49.190> want<00:04:49.460> to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
up and that the tail of the turn want to

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.110 
up and that the tail of the turn want to
release<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.660> add<00:04:50.870> more<00:04:51.880> turbo<00:04:52.880> boost

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
release and they add more turbo boost

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.180 
release and they add more turbo boost
out<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.389> the<00:04:53.569> tail<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.050> turn<00:04:54.259> just<00:04:55.039> like

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
out of the tail of the turn just like

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.129 
out of the tail of the turn just like
the<00:04:55.370> kinetic<00:04:55.820> energy<00:04:56.270> recovery<00:04:56.419> system

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
the kinetic energy recovery system

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.320 
the kinetic energy recovery system
that's<00:04:57.770> built<00:04:58.009> into<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.370> ski<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:58.880> add<00:04:59.090> the

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
that's built into the ski so you add the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.740 
that's built into the ski so you add the
cares

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750

really shoot you into that next turn we

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.659 
really shoot you into that next turn we

super<00:05:24.349> shape<00:05:24.560> line<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.400> can<00:05:25.550> think<00:05:25.759> about

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
super shape line and you can think about

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.320 
super shape line and you can think about
era<00:05:26.180> 3.0<00:05:26.840> s<00:05:27.050> almost<00:05:27.919> like<00:05:28.070> an<00:05:28.280> S<00:05:28.550> line<00:05:28.880> with<00:05:29.180> an

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
era 3.0 s almost like an S line with an

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.689 
era 3.0 s almost like an S line with an
Audi<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:30.229> this<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.680> we're<00:05:31.190> using<00:05:31.220> the

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
Audi so this is we're using the

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.820 
Audi so this is we're using the
technology<00:05:32.270> but<00:05:32.479> we've<00:05:32.630> refined<00:05:33.199> it<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.710> the

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
technology but we've refined it to the

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.920 
technology but we've refined it to the
performance<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.729> specifics<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.419> the

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
performance and the specifics of the

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.550 
performance and the specifics of the
super<00:05:36.289> shape<00:05:36.470> line<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:37.400> era<00:05:37.639> 3.0<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.570> rocker

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
super shape line so era 3.0 is rocker

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.520 
super shape line so era 3.0 is rocker
radius<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.789> rebound<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.599> we've<00:05:41.990> done<00:05:42.259> that

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
radius and rebound and we've done that

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.070 
radius and rebound and we've done that
same<00:05:43.280> technology<00:05:43.729> that<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.300> find<00:05:44.330> in<00:05:44.690> rev<00:05:44.900> in

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
same technology that you find in rev in

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.020 
same technology that you find in rev in
the<00:05:45.169> super<00:05:45.500> shape<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:45.919> we<00:05:46.039> widen<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.699> tip<00:05:46.880> of

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
the super shape so we widen the tip of

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.529 
the super shape so we widen the tip of
the<00:05:47.120> ski<00:05:47.949> narrowed<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.130> tail<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:50.030> that<00:05:50.060> adds

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
the ski narrowed the tail so that adds

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.749 
the ski narrowed the tail so that adds
that<00:05:50.900> that<00:05:51.009> progressive<00:05:52.009> radius<00:05:52.460> that<00:05:52.610> we

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
that that progressive radius that we

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.350 
that that progressive radius that we
talked<00:05:52.969> about<00:05:53.120> we've<00:05:54.110> also<00:05:54.440> added<00:05:54.889> a<00:05:55.280> speed<00:05:56.150> or

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
talked about we've also added a speed or

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.600 
talked about we've also added a speed or
race<00:05:56.630> rocker<00:05:56.990> which<00:05:57.349> is<00:05:57.500> just<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.830> met<00:05:58.190> small

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
race rocker which is just a met small

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.219 
race rocker which is just a met small
measured<00:05:59.060> amount<00:05:59.330> of<00:05:59.449> rocker<00:05:59.690> up<00:05:59.840> in<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.139> tip

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
measured amount of rocker up in the tip

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.249 
measured amount of rocker up in the tip
and<00:06:00.820> then<00:06:01.820> we<00:06:01.909> have<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.180> rebound<00:06:02.570> story<00:06:02.990> is

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
and then we have the rebound story is

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.860 
and then we have the rebound story is
the<00:06:03.949> kinetic<00:06:04.340> energy<00:06:04.759> recovery<00:06:04.909> system<00:06:05.719> that

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
the kinetic energy recovery system that

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.830 
the kinetic energy recovery system that
we<00:06:05.960> use<00:06:06.110> in<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.380> tail<00:06:06.590> so<00:06:07.250> we<00:06:07.400> have<00:06:07.570> race<00:06:08.570> or

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
we use in the tail so we have race or

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.439 
we use in the tail so we have race or
speed<00:06:09.139> rocker<00:06:09.759> progressive<00:06:10.759> radius<00:06:11.150> and<00:06:11.360> that

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
speed rocker progressive radius and that

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.339 
speed rocker progressive radius and that
very<00:06:11.690> v-shaped<00:06:12.380> wide<00:06:12.740> tip<00:06:13.099> narrower<00:06:13.610> tail

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
very v-shaped wide tip narrower tail

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.080 
very v-shaped wide tip narrower tail
progressive<00:06:15.349> sidecut<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:16.070> then<00:06:16.699> we<00:06:16.820> have<00:06:16.940> the

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
progressive sidecut and then we have the

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.659 
progressive sidecut and then we have the
cares<00:06:17.360> technology<00:06:18.080> as<00:06:18.289> our<00:06:18.650> rebound<00:06:19.159> and<00:06:19.340> that

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
cares technology as our rebound and that

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.950 
cares technology as our rebound and that
all<00:06:19.880> together<00:06:20.570> comes<00:06:21.020> and<00:06:21.699> equals<00:06:22.699> era<00:06:23.090> 3.0<00:06:23.719> s

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
all together comes and equals era 3.0 s

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.980 
all together comes and equals era 3.0 s
so<00:06:24.680> these<00:06:24.889> skis<00:06:25.280> have<00:06:26.000> as<00:06:26.210> much<00:06:26.419> performance

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
so these skis have as much performance

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.230 
so these skis have as much performance
as<00:06:27.199> they<00:06:27.320> have<00:06:27.440> technology<00:06:27.680> they<00:06:28.520> are<00:06:28.729> truly

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
as they have technology they are truly
