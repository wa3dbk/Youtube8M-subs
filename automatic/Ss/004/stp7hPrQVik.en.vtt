00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.850
 friend 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.400
 The game was developed and published by 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 clean entertainment only for pc and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 that was created in 2005 by jaime king 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.870
 with amounts collected from the sale of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 some actions for great land that are 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.910
 with the $ 10,000 loan from the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 Your brother is a Canadian developer. 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 based in Vancouver with brand of ninja 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.989
 and shank in his portfolio the history of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 game is very simple you will be 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 initially I am a scientist with 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 British airman who was arrested by a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 demon and transported by a world 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 completely mysterious bizarre its 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 the new life goal will be 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.920
 survive 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.629
 exploring the environment by learning to cope 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 with its new reality trying to find 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.830
 a way to get back home 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.409
 all surviving the monsters and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 finding food 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.710
 The goal of the game is simply to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.580
 survive the dangers of the forest and not 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.590
 to die of form 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 basically you should collect items from the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.360
 ground like peta on twigs 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
 excellent carrots among other things 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 to start to keep after 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.299
 collect the first items you will have the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.610
 necessary to build some 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.619
 more primitive materials to achieve 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.259
 More things like cut trees dig 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 holes and picks to break rocks 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.100
 The game does not have a basic rule about 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.159
 your survival 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.049
 once as the pea thorium and yet 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 when exploring the environment you will have 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.680
 open on your personal map 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.670
 although I did not see the activities of this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.320
 local 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.909
 the game features a system of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.189
 progression that release some news 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.780
 as you evolve levels 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.549
 when it comes to beto for now 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.200
 there are many achievements to be released 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.240
 with its evolution 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.740
 the gameplay of the game is very simple and 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 ease to get used to the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 camera is very large once you 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 you can change the angle to facilitate 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.550
 your view the variety of animals eaten 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.970
 and enemies is reasonable and comparisons with 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.890
 minecraft do not have many funds 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.870
 since in spite of being a game of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.880
 Surviving the construction of things is 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.670
 very minimalist and practically 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.590
 customized the good use of your inventory 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.000
 cause you can play good 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.370
 things to survive 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 some prefer to be more nomadic but 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.910
 it will be essential to stabilize in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.010
 some point on the map to develop 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.230
 some more advanced things like 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.030
 research machine and plantations 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.550
 Another tip is to stay close to 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.250
 animals because their scraps serve 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.810
 as fertilizer for plants and shrubs for 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.820
 get more food 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.520
 the game does not have a multiplayer version 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.330
 and the soundtrack, although simple, is 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.330
 very good taste 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.050
 gift was a very light game and his 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.700
 practically free price 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.740
 since you are currently buying a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.720
 license you take an additional 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.740
 approximate price of 10 reais for each 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.260
 one of the keys 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.020
 the game is worth very worth is the validity of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.209
 maps and the next updates make 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.300
 with which the game is very interesting 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.890
 Thinking about it our note 8 and mail 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.320
