00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
considered Ironwood just they call it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.799 
considered Ironwood just they call it
Ironwood

it underground for a hundred years pull

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.099 
it underground for a hundred years pull
it<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.359> it'll<00:00:21.359> show<00:00:21.420> no<00:00:21.720> signs<00:00:21.960> of

it out and it'll show no signs of
corrosion<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.590> doesn't<00:00:22.859> corrode<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.340> super

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
corrosion it doesn't corrode it's super

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.920 
corrosion it doesn't corrode it's super
super<00:00:24.420> dense<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> dense<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.210> termites<00:00:27.660> or

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
super dense so dense that termites or

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.980 
super dense so dense that termites or
any<00:00:28.109> bugs<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.529> even<00:00:28.970> mess<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
any bugs don't even mess with it it's a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
any bugs don't even mess with it it's a
so<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:31.920> resistant<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> termites<00:00:32.700> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so it's resistant to termites it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.270 
so it's resistant to termites it's
resistance<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> resistant<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> corroding<00:00:35.130> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
resistance to resistant to corroding and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.610 
resistance to resistant to corroding and
they<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.090> I've<00:00:36.960> even<00:00:37.140> heard<00:00:37.200> people<00:00:37.290> say<00:00:37.590> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
furring strip as opposed to just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
furring strip as opposed to just
slapping<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> one<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.400> tiger<00:01:11.670> wood

straight onto the house the reason for a
furring<00:01:14.340> strip<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.570> allows<00:01:15.890> water<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
furring strip is it allows water to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
water could get smushed up back there

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
water could get smushed up back there
and<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.270> tracked<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and just be tracked back there and you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330 
and just be tracked back there and you
know<00:01:40.770> could<00:01:41.210> start<00:01:42.210> leading<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> any<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
know could start leading to any kind of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.770 
know could start leading to any kind of
corrosion<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.820> any<00:01:45.000> wood<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.390> anything<00:01:45.570> else

corrosion of any wood or anything else

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.600 
corrosion of any wood or anything else
back<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> furring

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
back there but so we put the furring

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
back there but so we put the furring
strip<00:01:47.790> down<00:01:47.970> 16<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> center

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

strip down 16 on center
that's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.350> 1x2<00:01:50.130> furring<00:01:50.939> strip<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.600> an

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that's a 1x2 furring strip so it's an

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
that's a 1x2 furring strip so it's an
inch<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> wall<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.490> then<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.740> have

inch from the wall and then we you have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
inch from the wall and then we you have
to<00:01:55.979> pre-drill<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.939> tiger<00:01:57.240> wood<00:01:57.390> because

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
to pre-drill the the tiger wood because

it's so hard you have to pre-drill the
hole<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.369> it'll<00:01:59.549> it'll<00:01:59.909> split<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.869> we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
hole or it'll it'll split so we

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
at the at the edge here we we to make a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.990 
at the at the edge here we we to make a
cleaner<00:02:45.230> look<00:02:45.530> we're<00:02:45.980> doing<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.340> mitered

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
cleaner look we're doing a mitered

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.940 
cleaner look we're doing a mitered
corner<00:02:47.410> although<00:02:48.410> if<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.530> can<00:02:48.650> come<00:02:48.830> around

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
corner although if you can come around

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.190 
corner although if you can come around
and<00:02:49.430> kind<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:49.910> see<00:02:50.030> how<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.239> mitered<00:02:50.840> corner

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
and kind of see how the mitered corner

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.350 
and kind of see how the mitered corner
works<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:51.620> instead<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.640> having<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.000> showing

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
works but instead of having just showing

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
works but instead of having just showing
the<00:02:53.480> edge<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> shiplap<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.769> 45<00:02:55.519> on

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the edge of the shiplap you do a 45 on

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.900 
the edge of the shiplap you do a 45 on
that<00:02:56.180> you've<00:02:56.300> cut<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.570> 45<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.040> 45<00:02:58.400> angle<00:02:58.550> and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
that you've cut it 45 on a 45 angle and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.520 
that you've cut it 45 on a 45 angle and
you<00:02:59.120> bring<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.360> two<00:02:59.480> together<00:02:59.630> so<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.410> like

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you bring the two together so it's like

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.949 
you bring the two together so it's like
a<00:03:00.560> seamless<00:03:00.890> look<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.390> can<00:03:02.510> see<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.780> at<00:03:02.870> the
