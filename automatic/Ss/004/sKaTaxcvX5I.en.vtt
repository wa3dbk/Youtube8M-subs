but<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.800> definitely<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.310> decent<00:00:26.670> size<00:00:27.740> one

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
but it's definitely a decent size one

frogs that type of the thing they do
make<00:00:44.219> excellent<00:00:44.910> terrariums<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:46.500> these

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
make excellent terrariums with these

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.540 
make excellent terrariums with these
little<00:00:46.980> black<00:00:47.160> hatches<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.180> here

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
little black hatches that they have here

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.069 
little black hatches that they have here
you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.700> slide<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.059> back<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.449> forth<00:00:51.719> and

you can slide them back and forth and
what<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.160> does<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> allows<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> run

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

wires through the back of the screen

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.439 
wires through the back of the screen
however<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.789> problem<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.329> do

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
however this is one problem that I do

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a while I use these for crested geckos

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
a while I use these for crested geckos
before<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> keep<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.710> decent

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
before and you do need to keep a decent

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.090 
before and you do need to keep a decent
amount<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.400> humidity<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.909> their<00:01:09.080> problem<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
amount of humidity in their problem the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.760 
amount of humidity in their problem the
top<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> entirely<00:01:11.790> screen<00:01:12.409> there's<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:13.590> way

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
top is entirely screen there's no way

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.480 
top is entirely screen there's no way
really<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:15.030> offer<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.590> seal<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
really that they offer to seal these to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.510 
really that they offer to seal these to
keep<00:01:17.700> humidity<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.360> moisture<00:01:18.509> inside<00:01:19.280> also<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
keep humidity and moisture inside also I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
keep humidity and moisture inside also I
found<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
found that as you can see right here a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.520 
found that as you can see right here a
little<00:01:23.580> water<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.180> rust<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.720> D<00:01:24.869> crap<00:01:25.320> out

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.030 
one of my biggest issues with it another
thing<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:32.939> these<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.390> they<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:33.960> come<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
destroyed the crap out of it by just

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.050 
destroyed the crap out of it by just
clawing<00:01:47.490> at<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
clawing at it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
clawing at it
I<00:01:48.090> had<00:01:48.869> styrofoam<00:01:49.380> bits<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.369> as

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
I had styrofoam bits all around it as

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.850 
I had styrofoam bits all around it as
well<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:52.130> crickets<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.409> super<00:01:55.409> worms<00:01:55.560> things

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
well as crickets and super worms things

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
well as crickets and super worms things
like<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> will<00:01:56.369> barrel<00:01:56.759> right<00:01:57.060> into<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
like that will barrel right into it and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.300 
like that will barrel right into it and
get<00:01:57.750> behind<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.860> never<00:01:59.100> come<00:01:59.280> out

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
get behind it and really never come out

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
get behind it and really never come out
again<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:00.960> definitely<00:02:01.200> another

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
again so that was definitely another

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.270 
again so that was definitely another
problem<00:02:02.159> also<00:02:02.899> it's<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.439> easy<00:02:04.890> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
problem also it's really not easy to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.580 
problem also it's really not easy to
clean<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.000> start<00:02:06.329> washing<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.320> there's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
clean you start washing it if there's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.859 
clean you start washing it if there's
you<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:07.799> dried<00:02:08.250> gecko<00:02:08.550> poop<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you know dried gecko poop on there and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.059 
you know dried gecko poop on there and
or<00:02:09.989> something<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> need<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> clean

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
or something like that you need to clean

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.690 
or something like that you need to clean
off

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
off

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.059 
off
it's<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.600> gonna<00:02:12.780> rub<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.290> styrofoam<00:02:13.830> away

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it's just gonna rub the styrofoam away

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's just gonna rub the styrofoam away
and<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.990> just<00:02:16.020> gets<00:02:16.470> weaker<00:02:16.950> from<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:18.260> one

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and it just gets weaker from that one

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.960 
and it just gets weaker from that one
thing<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.770> about<00:02:19.920> these<00:02:20.130> though<00:02:20.370> is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
thing I do like about these though is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.500 
thing I do like about these though is
they<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.480> front<00:02:21.840> locking<00:02:22.380> doors<00:02:23.510> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
they do have front locking doors it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.809 
they do have front locking doors it's
definitely<00:02:25.110> nice<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.890> easy<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.340> clean<00:02:26.550> easy

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
definitely nice it's easy to clean easy

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.460 
definitely nice it's easy to clean easy
to<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:28.280> also<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:30.650> screen<00:02:31.650> lid<00:02:32.030> has<00:02:33.470> six

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to get in also the screen lid has six

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.510 
to get in also the screen lid has six
locks<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.750> twist<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> off<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
locks on it so you just twist it off and

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.490 
locks on it so you just twist it off and
you<00:02:38.520> pull<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.840> pretty<00:02:40.050> easy<00:02:40.260> from

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
you pull it out it's pretty easy from

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.460 
you pull it out it's pretty easy from
there<00:02:41.180> they<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.420> pretty<00:02:42.810> heavy<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.170> their

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
there they are pretty heavy for their

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.800 
there they are pretty heavy for their
size<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.730> guess<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.390> know<00:02:45.510> what

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
size but I guess that's you know what

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.100 
size but I guess that's you know what
what's<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.680> expected<00:02:47.390> there<00:02:48.390> are<00:02:48.570> vents

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
what's to be expected there are vents

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.900 
what's to be expected there are vents
down<00:02:49.350> here

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
down here

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
down here
what's<00:02:50.910> your<00:02:51.030> nice<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.080> also<00:02:52.290> feel<00:02:52.680> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
what's your nice but I also feel that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.350 
what's your nice but I also feel that
those<00:02:53.340> will<00:02:53.700> prove<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:55.850> humidity<00:02:56.850> loss<00:02:57.090> if

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
those will prove in a humidity loss if

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.860 
those will prove in a humidity loss if
you're<00:02:57.480> trying<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> keep<00:02:57.959> humidity<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.590> here

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
you're trying to keep humidity in here

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.030 
you're trying to keep humidity in here
but<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.930> definitely<00:03:01.110> say<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.560> these<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:01.950> one

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
but I definitely say that these are one

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.710 
but I definitely say that these are one
of<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> easier<00:03:02.519> things<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.970> run<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.390> chair<00:03:03.630> area

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of the easier things to run a chair area

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.509 
of the easier things to run a chair area
man<00:03:04.019> when<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.290> need<00:03:04.530> pumps<00:03:05.070> or<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.310> need<00:03:05.489> a

man when you need pumps or you need a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.380 
man when you need pumps or you need a
fogger<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.510> sorts<00:03:07.470> inside<00:03:08.220> without<00:03:08.550> having<00:03:09.209> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
fogger of sorts inside without having to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.449 
fogger of sorts inside without having to
deal<00:03:09.810> with<00:03:09.840> cutting<00:03:10.320> holes<00:03:10.590> into<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.100> screen

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
deal with cutting holes into a screen

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.600 
deal with cutting holes into a screen
top<00:03:11.670> or<00:03:11.910> something<00:03:12.239> along<00:03:12.480> those<00:03:12.660> lines<00:03:13.610> as

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
top or something along those lines as

with everything exit Aaron Hagan makes

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.960 
with everything exit Aaron Hagan makes
it's<00:03:17.160> expensive<00:03:19.340> don't<00:03:20.340> know<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.579> it's<00:03:20.700> really

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
it's expensive don't know if it's really

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.630 
it's expensive don't know if it's really
worth<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.360> price<00:03:21.600> but<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:23.220> able<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.489> get

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
worth the price but I was able to get

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.910 
worth the price but I was able to get
this<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:24.000> sale<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:25.160> ended<00:03:26.160> up<00:03:26.250> doing<00:03:26.430> it

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
this on sale so I ended up doing it

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.050 
this on sale so I ended up doing it
overall<00:03:28.920> I'd<00:03:29.070> definitely<00:03:29.430> say<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.880> is

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
overall I'd definitely say that this is

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.880 
overall I'd definitely say that this is
about<00:03:30.299> an<00:03:30.600> 8<00:03:30.750> out<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.989> 10<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.380> does<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.739> its

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
about an 8 out of 10 it does have its

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.240 
about an 8 out of 10 it does have its
flaws<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:34.410> glass<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.890> weak<00:03:36.079> but<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:38.010> fact

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
flaws the glass is weak but the fact

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.340 
flaws the glass is weak but the fact
that<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.579> does<00:03:38.760> hold<00:03:39.030> some<00:03:39.180> water<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:40.019> rated

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
that it does hold some water it is rated

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.400 
that it does hold some water it is rated
for<00:03:40.500> water<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:41.040> kind<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.489> nice<00:03:41.700> too<00:03:42.110> but<00:03:43.110> as<00:03:43.260> I

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
for water is kind of nice too but as I

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.400 
for water is kind of nice too but as I
said<00:03:43.590> some<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.950> downfalls<00:03:44.430> are<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.410> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
said some of the downfalls are the the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.310 
said some of the downfalls are the the
rock<00:03:46.620> wall<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.070> back<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:48.720> tossed

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
rock wall in the back and just tossed

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.350 
rock wall in the back and just tossed
mine<00:03:49.590> away<00:03:49.799> after<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.489> was<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.150> much

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
mine away after it was pretty much

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.920 
mine away after it was pretty much
destroyed<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.829> screen<00:03:53.160> top<00:03:53.400> I<00:03:54.269> figure

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
destroyed and the screen top I figure

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.370 
destroyed and the screen top I figure
you<00:03:55.110> could<00:03:55.380> put<00:03:55.829> some<00:03:56.780> like<00:03:57.780> Plexiglas

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
you could put some like Plexiglas

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
you could put some like Plexiglas
layered<00:03:58.709> over<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.269> but<00:04:00.860> it'll<00:04:01.860> only<00:04:01.890> last<00:04:02.190> for

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
layered over it but it'll only last for

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.990 
layered over it but it'll only last for
so<00:04:02.459> long<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.860> just<00:04:05.100> bends<00:04:05.370> too<00:04:05.760> easily

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
so long and it it just bends too easily

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.990 
so long and it it just bends too easily
I<00:04:06.450> mean<00:04:07.079> it's<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:07.560> really<00:04:08.400> not<00:04:08.609> terribly

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
I mean it's it's really not terribly

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.620 
I mean it's it's really not terribly
secured<00:04:09.480> in<00:04:09.600> there<00:04:10.700> overall<00:04:11.700> yeah<00:04:11.940> definitely

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
secured in there overall yeah definitely

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.870
