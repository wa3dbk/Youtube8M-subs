scare<00:01:48.750> last<00:01:48.899> against<00:01:49.259> cuckoo<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:49.979> may<00:01:50.430> be

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
scare last against cuckoo so they may be

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
scare last against cuckoo so they may be
not<00:01:50.700> playing<00:01:50.909> their<00:01:51.060> best<00:01:51.090> football<00:01:51.570> coming

not playing their best football coming

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
not playing their best football coming
in<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.710> Miller<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> last<00:01:53.460> two<00:01:53.610> weeks

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.889 
in and then Miller on the last two weeks
I<00:01:53.970> think<00:01:54.000> they've<00:01:54.240> always<00:01:54.390> scored<00:01:54.689> two

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
I think they've always scored two

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
I think they've always scored two

quarters i mean they koo koo had a

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.469 
quarters i mean they koo koo had a
chance<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.759> they<00:01:59.939> had<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.149> lead<00:02:00.329> in

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
chance you know they had to lead in

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
chance you know they had to lead in

a<00:02:11.250> close<00:02:11.370> game<00:02:11.459> poke<00:02:11.879> fun<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.569> win<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:12.930> whose

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
a close game poke fun all win but whose

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.850 
a close game poke fun all win but whose
think<00:02:13.690> they're<00:02:14.020> not<00:02:14.260> going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.530> score<00:02:14.740> an

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
think they're not going to score an

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.980 
think they're not going to score an
offense<00:02:15.220> right<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.630> what's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
offense right so I think what's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.170 
offense right so I think what's
happening<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.530> both<00:02:17.860> panoho<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.820> mililani

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
happening is both panoho in mililani

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.330 
happening is both panoho in mililani
they're<00:02:19.450> learning<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.990> win<00:02:20.140> ugly<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:21.190> have

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
they're learning to win ugly you have

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
they're learning to win ugly you have
basketball<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.910> play<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.240> many<00:02:22.360> games<00:02:22.480> you

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
basketball you play so many games you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.290 
basketball you play so many games you
could<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.680> a<00:02:23.710> run-and-gun<00:02:24.040> team<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.790> once<00:02:25.180> in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
could be a run-and-gun team but once in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.120 
could be a run-and-gun team but once in
a<00:02:25.390> while<00:02:25.540> team<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> slow<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.110> down<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:27.100> you

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
a while team to slow it down and you

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.500 
a while team to slow it down and you
have<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.520> win<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.670> close<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> game

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
have to win a close up the game

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.890 
have to win a close up the game
low-scoring<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.850> think<00:02:30.850> mililani<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> learning

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
low-scoring I think mililani is learning

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.630 
low-scoring I think mililani is learning
that<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.320> know<00:02:32.680> rod<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:33.070> willing<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
that you know rod is willing to just

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.540 
that you know rod is willing to just
give<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.390> bottom<00:02:34.690> line<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:36.040> he<00:02:36.190> only<00:02:36.340> gets

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
give the bottom line and if he only gets

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.270 
give the bottom line and if he only gets
50<00:02:37.000> yards<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:37.750> he<00:02:37.840> carries<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.200> 25<00:02:38.740> times<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
50 yards but he carries it 25 times and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.410 
50 yards but he carries it 25 times and
they<00:02:39.340> win<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.610> game<00:02:39.790> that's<00:02:40.000> what<00:02:40.210> they<00:02:40.300> have

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
they win the game that's what they have

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720 
they win the game that's what they have
to<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.690> right<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.740> think<00:02:41.770> one<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.190> all<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
to do right and I think one of all you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.160 
to do right and I think one of all you
know<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:42.970> first<00:02:43.270> close<00:02:43.570> game<00:02:43.810> they<00:02:43.960> have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
know that first close game they have

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.600 
know that first close game they have
once<00:02:44.440> again<00:02:44.590> seeing<00:02:44.860> what's<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.190> second<00:02:45.520> time

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
once again seeing what's the second time

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.800 
once again seeing what's the second time
are<00:02:45.760> all<00:02:45.850> saying<00:02:46.060> was<00:02:46.270> finally<00:02:46.570> got<00:02:46.720> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
are all saying was finally got the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.680 
are all saying was finally got the
defense<00:02:47.170> together<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.820> think<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> night

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
defense together and I think that night

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.930 
defense together and I think that night
they<00:02:49.990> realize<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.680> what<00:02:50.830> we<00:02:51.670> haven't

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
they realize you know what we haven't

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.760 
they realize you know what we haven't
had<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.060> many<00:02:52.330> games<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:53.020> have<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.380> too

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
had that many games you have that too

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.910 
had that many games you have that too
many<00:02:53.860> tight<00:02:54.280> games<00:02:54.580> none<00:02:55.090> until<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.740> now

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
many tight games none until now so now

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.850 
many tight games none until now so now
they<00:02:57.160> figured<00:02:57.520> out<00:02:57.670> how<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.510> win<00:02:59.110> ugly<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.740> you
