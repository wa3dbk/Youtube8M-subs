vomited on it and I wrecked it but

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.959 
vomited on it and I wrecked it but
that's<00:00:38.910> ok<00:00:39.329> because<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> books<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> it's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that's ok because this is books and it's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.290 
that's ok because this is books and it's
what<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.829> inside<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.890> matters<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:44.969> on

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
what is inside that matters and not on

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
what is inside that matters and not on
the<00:00:45.420> outside<00:00:46.010> though<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.219> outside<00:00:47.550> tends<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the outside though the outside tends to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.319 
the outside though the outside tends to
be<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.329> cool<00:00:48.629> most<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> time<00:00:50.329> anyways

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
be really cool most of the time anyways

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
be really cool most of the time anyways
