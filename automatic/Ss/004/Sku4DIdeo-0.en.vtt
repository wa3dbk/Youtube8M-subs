00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
thought it would and so yep that's the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.330 
thought it would and so yep that's the
end<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.810> video<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.410> once<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.950> get<00:02:04.160> your

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
end of the video and once you get your
