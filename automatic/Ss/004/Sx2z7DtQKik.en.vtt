between 1969 and 1972 NASA claims that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.580 
between 1969 and 1972 NASA claims that
put<00:00:16.670> 12<00:00:16.970> men<00:00:17.210> on<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.390> moon<00:00:17.630> several<00:00:18.380> years

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
put 12 men on the moon several years

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.840 
put 12 men on the moon several years
after<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:18.890> books<00:00:19.220> were<00:00:19.340> published<00:00:19.520> that

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
after that books were published that

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.359 
after that books were published that
accused<00:00:20.240> NASA<00:00:20.480> faking<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.260> landings<00:00:21.710> and

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
accused NASA faking the landings and

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.769 
accused NASA faking the landings and
they<00:00:22.550> claim<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.300> landings<00:00:23.630> were

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
they claim is that the landings were

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.810 
they claim is that the landings were
shot<00:00:24.050> in<00:00:24.200> a<00:00:24.290> TV<00:00:24.619> studio<00:00:24.800> there<00:00:25.460> have<00:00:25.550> also<00:00:25.700> been

shot in a TV studio there have also been

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.999 
shot in a TV studio there have also been
several<00:00:26.119> films<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:26.900> websites<00:00:27.320> devoted<00:00:27.590> to

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
several films and websites devoted to

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.679 
several films and websites devoted to
disproving<00:00:28.640> it<00:00:28.759> but<00:00:28.970> most<00:00:29.150> of<00:00:29.240> these<00:00:29.390> claims

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
disproving it but most of these claims

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.839 
disproving it but most of these claims
are<00:00:29.930> based<00:00:30.169> on<00:00:30.349> sloppy<00:00:30.650> science<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.430> wild

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
are based on sloppy science and wild

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.000 
are based on sloppy science and wild
speculation<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:32.840> experts<00:00:33.470> have<00:00:33.650> provided

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
speculation and experts have provided

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.860 
speculation and experts have provided
explanations<00:00:34.880> for<00:00:35.120> all<00:00:35.210> of<00:00:35.420> these<00:00:35.540> claims

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
explanations for all of these claims

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.870 
explanations for all of these claims
they<00:00:36.530> claim<00:00:36.770> that<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:37.070> rocket<00:00:37.399> capable<00:00:37.820> of

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
they claim that a rocket capable of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.400 
they claim that a rocket capable of
landing<00:00:38.210> on<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.420> moon<00:00:38.540> should<00:00:38.899> have<00:00:39.020> created

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
landing on the moon should have created

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.290 
landing on the moon should have created
a<00:00:39.470> crater<00:00:39.680> on<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.980> surface<00:00:40.489> but<00:00:40.970> there<00:00:41.149> is

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
a crater on the surface but there is

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.000 
a crater on the surface but there is
none<00:00:41.570> that's<00:00:41.840> because<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.410> rocket<00:00:42.739> didn't

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
none that's because the rocket didn't

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.130 
none that's because the rocket didn't
slam<00:00:43.280> into<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.670> moon<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:44.149> decelerated<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
slam into the moon it decelerated and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.680 
slam into the moon it decelerated and
only<00:00:45.469> had<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.649> 1.5<00:00:46.370> pound<00:00:46.789> per<00:00:47.059> inch<00:00:47.210> impact

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
only had a 1.5 pound per inch impact

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.020 
only had a 1.5 pound per inch impact
that's<00:00:48.289> less<00:00:48.559> than<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:48.829> human<00:00:49.010> there's<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.699> video

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
that's less than a human there's a video

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.880 
that's less than a human there's a video
showing<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:50.480> first<00:00:50.719> man<00:00:51.079> stepping<00:00:51.440> onto<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
showing the first man stepping onto the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.830 
showing the first man stepping onto the
moon<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.579> they<00:00:52.699> say<00:00:52.910> how<00:00:53.120> did<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.329> camera<00:00:53.660> get

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
moon so they say how did a camera get

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.810 
moon so they say how did a camera get
there<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.350> was<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.649> an<00:00:54.769> extending<00:00:55.339> arm<00:00:55.579> that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
there it was on an extending arm that

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.700 
there it was on an extending arm that
swung<00:00:56.120> out<00:00:56.359> from<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.690> ladder<00:00:56.899> for<00:00:57.530> this

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
swung out from the ladder for this

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.529 
swung out from the ladder for this
purpose<00:00:58.129> they<00:00:58.550> asked<00:00:58.730> why<00:00:59.059> don't<00:00:59.210> you<00:00:59.329> see

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
purpose they asked why don't you see

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.419 
purpose they asked why don't you see
stars<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.170> some<00:01:00.379> of<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.530> pictures<00:01:00.739> the

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
stars and some of the pictures the

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.250 
stars and some of the pictures the
cameras<00:01:01.789> exposures<00:01:02.329> were<00:01:02.510> set<00:01:02.719> very<00:01:02.989> fast

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
cameras exposures were set very fast

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.770 
cameras exposures were set very fast
shutter<00:01:03.649> speed<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.400> capture<00:01:04.760> bright<00:01:05.180> objects

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
shutter speed to capture bright objects

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.110 
shutter speed to capture bright objects
because<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.620> moon<00:01:06.860> was<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:07.190> direct<00:01:07.460> sunlight

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
because the moon was in direct sunlight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.000 
because the moon was in direct sunlight
they<00:01:08.540> say<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.870> astronauts<00:01:09.380> shadows<00:01:09.830> are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
they say the astronauts shadows are

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.620 
they say the astronauts shadows are
different<00:01:10.310> lengths<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:10.850> different<00:01:11.270> pictures

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
different lengths in different pictures

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.510 
different lengths in different pictures
and<00:01:11.900> this<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.409> simply<00:01:12.650> because<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.159> moon<00:01:13.310> has

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
and this is simply because the moon has

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.060 
and this is simply because the moon has
hills<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.120> shadows<00:01:14.990> appear<00:01:15.380> different

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
hills and shadows appear different

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010 
hills and shadows appear different
lengths<00:01:16.430> depending<00:01:17.090> on<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> steepness<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.900> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
lengths depending on the steepness of a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.960 
lengths depending on the steepness of a
hill<00:01:18.200> they<00:01:18.680> say<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:19.010> some<00:01:19.220> footage<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.730> fog

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
hill they say in some footage the fog

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.850 
hill they say in some footage the fog
appears<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.570> wave<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.410> vacuum<00:01:21.800> of

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
appears to wave but in the vacuum of

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.560 
appears to wave but in the vacuum of
space<00:01:21.920> there's<00:01:22.520> no<00:01:22.580> wind<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.330> shouldn't

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
space there's no wind so it shouldn't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.390 
space there's no wind so it shouldn't
wave<00:01:23.840> if<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.440> actually<00:01:24.770> watch<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.160> footage

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
wave if you actually watch the footage

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490 
wave if you actually watch the footage
though<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:26.150> only<00:01:26.240> waves<00:01:26.660> when<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> astronauts

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
though it only waves when the astronauts

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.260 
though it only waves when the astronauts
are<00:01:27.710> touching<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.160> flag<00:01:28.430> they<00:01:28.850> claim<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
are touching the flag they claim the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.760 
are touching the flag they claim the
astronauts<00:01:29.750> wouldn't<00:01:30.080> have<00:01:30.170> survived<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
astronauts wouldn't have survived the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.890 
astronauts wouldn't have survived the
Van<00:01:30.950> Allen<00:01:31.310> radiation<00:01:31.400> belt<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:32.630> even

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
Van Allen radiation belt but even

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.050 
Van Allen radiation belt but even
professor<00:01:33.350> James<00:01:33.650> a<00:01:33.890> venom<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.700> man<00:01:34.910> who

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
professor James a venom the man who

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.330 
professor James a venom the man who
discovered<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.600> radiation<00:01:36.170> belt<00:01:36.470> says<00:01:37.040> that

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
discovered the radiation belt says that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.040 
discovered the radiation belt says that
it<00:01:37.580> wouldn't<00:01:37.850> be<00:01:37.910> enough<00:01:38.120> radiation<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> harm

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
it wouldn't be enough radiation the harm

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.930 
it wouldn't be enough radiation the harm
then<00:01:39.260> they<00:01:39.800> say<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.130> pictures<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.760> moon

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
then they say the pictures of the moon

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.000 
then they say the pictures of the moon
look<00:01:41.210> too<00:01:41.420> perfect<00:01:41.660> so<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.470> must<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.770> been

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
look too perfect so they must have been

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.130 
look too perfect so they must have been
staged<00:01:43.310> but<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:44.150> reality<00:01:44.300> not<00:01:44.810> all<00:01:45.020> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
staged but in reality not all the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.290 
staged but in reality not all the
pictures<00:01:45.470> are<00:01:45.620> perfect<00:01:46.010> in<00:01:46.670> total<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> men

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
pictures are perfect in total the men
