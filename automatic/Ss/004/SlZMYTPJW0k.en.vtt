00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
not going to put the map on it we were

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.250 
not going to put the map on it we were
actually<00:04:38.270> sitting<00:04:38.390> in<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.630> Amazon<00:04:38.930> or<00:04:39.050> like

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
gonna order a map and then I was like

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.570 
gonna order a map and then I was like
hey<00:04:41.000> wait<00:04:41.330> let's<00:04:42.290> not<00:04:42.500> order<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> map<00:04:43.040> because

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
hey wait let's not order a map because

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.820 
hey wait let's not order a map because
we<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:44.000> you<00:04:44.660> know<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.930> digital<00:04:45.080> map<00:04:45.440> online

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
we have you know the digital map online

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.920 
we have you know the digital map online
it<00:04:46.340> was<00:04:46.460> a<00:04:46.490> good<00:04:46.580> idea<00:04:46.700> but<00:04:47.420> there's<00:04:47.600> no<00:04:47.690> reason

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
it was a good idea but there's no reason

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.420 
it was a good idea but there's no reason
to<00:04:47.990> have<00:04:48.080> two<00:04:48.230> maps<00:04:48.410> and<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.010> online<00:04:49.250> is

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
to have two maps and the one online is

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.820 
to have two maps and the one online is
easier<00:04:49.730> to<00:04:49.790> update<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.450> we<00:04:51.050> decided<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.560> this

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
easier to update so we decided that this

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.820 
easier to update so we decided that this
is<00:04:51.950> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:53.030> art<00:04:53.300> board<00:04:53.710> for<00:04:54.710> your

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
is going to be the art board for your

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.670 
is going to be the art board for your
art<00:04:55.040> that<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.000> send<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:57.200> put<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.470> up<00:04:57.560> on

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
art that you send in and put it up on

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.380 
art that you send in and put it up on
the<00:04:57.770> board<00:04:57.890> either<00:04:58.520> work<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.880> like<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.180> card

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
the board either work just like the card

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.930 
the board either work just like the card
frame<00:04:59.660> you<00:05:00.350> know<00:05:00.440> we'll<00:05:00.770> try<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.160> do<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.700> maybe

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
frame you know we'll try to do it maybe

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.310 
frame you know we'll try to do it maybe
in<00:05:02.150> rows<00:05:02.360> or<00:05:02.540> something<00:05:02.780> and<00:05:02.900> once<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.200> fills

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
in rows or something and once it fills

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.590 
in rows or something and once it fills
up<00:05:03.590> I'll<00:05:04.010> start<00:05:04.280> removing<00:05:04.520> stuff<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.300> make

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
up I'll start removing stuff to make

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.540 
up I'll start removing stuff to make
room<00:05:05.660> for<00:05:05.900> new<00:05:06.110> stuff<00:05:06.530> but<00:05:06.770> yeah<00:05:06.950> when<00:05:07.460> you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
room for new stuff but yeah when you
