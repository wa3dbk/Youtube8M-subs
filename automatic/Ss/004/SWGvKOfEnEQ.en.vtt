00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.930
 a true peculiarity in the realm of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.939
 conifer is the larch for it is 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.840
 the only conifer in winter 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.000
 his needles cast off the silhouette of his 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.100
 larch is slim and slender 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.870
 conical the tip of the maximum 40 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.650
 meter tall tree flats with 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:48.410
 increasing age from the bark of 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.150
 young larch is still smooth and green 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.150
 dyed to gray brown 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.640
 In the age she shows a greyish brown 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 scaly bark up to ten 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.650
 centimeter thick 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.650
 It also has deep reddish brown furrows 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.630
 The needles of the larches are soft and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.630
 front blunt or slightly pointed 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.990
 the needles are on young shoots 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.640
 single screw i arranged 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.619
 while they drifted into older ones 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.619
 rosette-like consist 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 in the autumn the needles of the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.630
 larches golden yellow before they fall off and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.090
 only small leaf bases and the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.370
 stay pegged 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.370
 This makes the bare branches look rough 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.790
 even before the removal of the needles begins 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.520
 between march and april the flowering of the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.390
 larks the first time the tree 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.580
 At least 15 years old is like all 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.400
 conifers is also the lark one 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 often that means male and female 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.480
 Blossoms come on a plant in front of the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.610
 Pollination takes over the wind 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.690
 male inflorescences can be recognized 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.640
 her egg-shaped almost bullet in women 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.600
 they are about a centimeter long and 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.630
 bright yellow green in big number 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 sit upside down at the course 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.690
 propel the lark, the single flower 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.780
 consists of stamens on one 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.269
 short still sitting under the shed 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.690
 shape lying on the bent end 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.510
 two poles of sack 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.580
 The female flowers are small cones 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.090
 the upright on the ice are 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.740
 they are about 25 centimeters more than 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.020
 twice the size of the male 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.670
 inflorescences 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.150
 they are particularly attractive through the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.950
 scrub reddish colored deck 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.570
 between them are the seed sheds 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.250
 each with two small seed plants 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.060
 the seeds are still in the fall of the same 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.400
 year ripe and are distributed by the wind 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 the light brown and about 3 mm long 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.170
 Seeds have a wing of theirs 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:31.420
 flying improves the empty one 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.730
 Woody cones still remain some 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.710
 years to stand with you 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.710
 on which they sit to fall off 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.470
 the european larch has one 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 pale root with a deeply branched 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.330
 heart root system so she can 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.980
 good on stony ground, too 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.900
 Anchor and survive violent storms 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.550
 almost every tree has a special one 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.220
 mushroom with which she lives in symbiosis 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:09.340
 The most common larch is the gold 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.680
 Roe the fine thread roots of the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.520
 mushrooms around spinning the tender root ends 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.070
 of the tree and dock there 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.290
 Now the mutual exchange begins 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.380
 the mushroom receives sugar and nutrients 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.380
 the tree sodium potassium and phosphorus 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.710
 the wood of the lark is appreciated for 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.440
 furniture construction and wall coverings it is 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.090
 tough as well as professional and lasting 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.090
 insensitive to fungus 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.340
 individual larks arrive 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.340
 biblical age of 6 100 years 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.710
 they do not get that old in the cities 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.750
 because you are against air pollution 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.220
 are sensitive 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.740
 Nevertheless, you will be happy in parks and 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.320
 planted for especially in the garden 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.390
 Golden autumn are these conifers 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.390
 attractive and striking
