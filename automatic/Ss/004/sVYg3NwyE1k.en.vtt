00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
National Forest and what you're looking

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.450 
National Forest and what you're looking
at<00:00:09.990> behind<00:00:10.139> me<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.770> is<00:00:10.799> evidence<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.370> a

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
at behind me here is evidence of a

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.180 
at behind me here is evidence of a
forest<00:00:11.820> thinning<00:00:12.120> project<00:00:12.809> now<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.650> first<00:00:14.010> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
forest thinning project now at first you

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.830 
forest thinning project now at first you
wonder<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.820> forest<00:00:15.150> thinning<00:00:15.269> has<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> do

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
wonder what forest thinning has to do

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.720 
wonder what forest thinning has to do
with<00:00:15.990> fire<00:00:16.170> preparedness<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
with fire preparedness but you got to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
with fire preparedness but you got to
understand<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> fire<00:00:18.630> triangle<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.650> fire

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
understand the fire triangle a fire

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.730 
understand the fire triangle a fire
needs<00:00:20.609> three<00:00:20.699> things<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.510> survive<00:00:21.690> it<00:00:22.440> needs

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
needs three things to survive it needs

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.760 
needs three things to survive it needs
oxygen<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.730> needs<00:00:24.029> heat<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.080> needs<00:00:25.289> fuel

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
oxygen it needs heat and it needs fuel

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.710 
oxygen it needs heat and it needs fuel
well<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.390> much<00:00:27.570> control

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
well we don't really have much control

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.080 
well we don't really have much control
over<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.320> oxygen<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> especially<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.939> some

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
over the oxygen and especially with some

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.790 
over the oxygen and especially with some
of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> lightning<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.930> sometimes<00:00:31.170> don't<00:00:31.590> have

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
of the lightning we sometimes don't have

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.470 
of the lightning we sometimes don't have
much<00:00:31.980> control<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.760> heat<00:00:32.970> portion<00:00:33.360> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
much control over the heat portion of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.660 
much control over the heat portion of
that<00:00:33.540> fire<00:00:33.780> triangle<00:00:34.260> either<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.430> do

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that fire triangle either but what we do

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
that fire triangle either but what we do
have<00:00:35.699> control<00:00:36.120> over<00:00:36.330> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> amount<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> fuel

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
have control over is the amount of fuel

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.639 
have control over is the amount of fuel
without<00:00:38.399> fuel<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.969> fire<00:00:39.000> can't<00:00:39.600> burn<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
without fuel a fire can't burn so what a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.530 
without fuel a fire can't burn so what a
forest<00:00:41.040> thinning<00:00:41.190> project<00:00:41.790> does<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
forest thinning project does is it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
forest thinning project does is it
reduces<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> amount<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> fuel<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:44.280> lessen

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
reduces that amount of fuel to lessen

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
reduces that amount of fuel to lessen
the<00:00:44.760> severity<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.390> fire<00:00:45.600> should<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.079> happen

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the severity of a fire should it happen

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.279 
the severity of a fire should it happen
in<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> area<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:48.270> historically<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.170> this

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
in this area so historically in this

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.990 
in this area so historically in this
area<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:49.950> standing<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.820> would

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
area where we're standing this would

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
area where we're standing this would
have<00:00:51.090> been<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> meadow<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.230> healthy<00:00:52.590> pretty

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
have been a meadow a very healthy pretty

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
have been a meadow a very healthy pretty
meadow<00:00:53.780> settlers<00:00:54.780> came<00:00:54.989> through<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.350> about

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
meadow settlers came through in about

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.520 
meadow settlers came through in about
the<00:00:55.770> 1980s<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.480> created<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the 1980s they actually created this

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
the 1980s they actually created this
area<00:00:59.100> they<00:00:59.520> made<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> plantation<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> they

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
area they made a plantation and they

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
area they made a plantation and they
planted<00:01:01.410> these<00:01:01.559> trees<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
planted these trees so these are a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
planted these trees so these are a
couple<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> decades<00:01:03.420> old<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.050> as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> see

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
couple of decades old and as you can see

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
couple of decades old and as you can see
the<00:01:05.070> trees<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.460> far<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:05.729> close<00:01:06.149> together

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the trees are far too close together

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.859 
the trees are far too close together
quite<00:01:07.110> unhealthy<00:01:07.410> not<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.340> large<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
quite unhealthy not very large so in a

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.130 
quite unhealthy not very large so in a
unplanned<00:01:10.860> fire<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:11.909> fuels<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.869> dry

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
unplanned fire these fuels on a very dry

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
unplanned fire these fuels on a very dry
day<00:01:13.200> could<00:01:13.830> turn<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.310> ladder<00:01:14.700> fuels

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
day could turn into ladder fuels

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.690 
day could turn into ladder fuels
building<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.260> forest<00:01:16.619> ground<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.520> these

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
building from the forest ground to these

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
building from the forest ground to these
small<00:01:18.150> trees<00:01:18.510> here<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.080> are<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.380> healthy

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
small trees here that are not healthy

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
small trees here that are not healthy
and<00:01:20.040> overgrown<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> larger

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and overgrown and into the larger

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
and overgrown and into the larger
portions<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.040> forest<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.119> our<00:01:24.479> crews

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
portions of the forest so our crews

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.320 
portions of the forest so our crews
today<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.470> reducing<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.610> ladder<00:01:26.909> fuels

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
today are reducing these ladder fuels

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
today are reducing these ladder fuels
and<00:01:27.750> helping<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> create<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and helping to create a more

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.060 
and helping to create a more
historically<00:01:30.000> proper<00:01:30.810> area<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
historically proper area all right so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.170 
historically proper area all right so
what<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> next<00:01:32.549> steps<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
what are the next steps for this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
what are the next steps for this
thinning<00:01:33.420> project<00:01:33.960> obviously<00:01:34.369> leaving<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
thinning project obviously leaving the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
thinning project obviously leaving the
trees<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.329> isn't<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
trees down like this isn't really

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
trees down like this isn't really
helping<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> fire<00:01:37.860> danger

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
helping much with the fire danger

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
helping much with the fire danger
they're<00:01:38.759> still<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> lead<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:40.290> sort

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
they're still going to lead to some sort

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
they're still going to lead to some sort
of<00:01:40.890> escalation<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> severity<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.509> an

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
of escalation of severity if an

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
of escalation of severity if an
unplanned<00:01:42.990> fire<00:01:43.320> were<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> occur<00:01:44.009> sitting

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
unplanned fire were to occur sitting

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.630 
unplanned fire were to occur sitting
like<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.600> what's<00:01:45.840> next<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.530> dozer<00:01:47.280> will

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
like this so what's next is a dozer will

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.010 
like this so what's next is a dozer will
come<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:48.060> our<00:01:48.090> crews<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.659> come<00:01:48.810> through

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
come through our crews will come through

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.139 
come through our crews will come through
with<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> bulldozer<00:01:49.890> push<00:01:50.640> these<00:01:50.850> piles

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
with the bulldozer push these piles

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.240 
with the bulldozer push these piles
together<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.930> then<00:01:52.290> we'll<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> prescribed

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
together and then we'll do a prescribed

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359 
together and then we'll do a prescribed
burn<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:54.509> case<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> prescribed<00:01:55.560> pile<00:01:56.009> burn

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
burn this case a prescribed pile burn

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
burn this case a prescribed pile burn
where<00:01:56.790> we'll<00:01:56.939> actually<00:01:57.119> set<00:01:57.479> fire<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.720> these

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
where we'll actually set fire to these

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.109 
where we'll actually set fire to these
piles<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.799> reduce<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.880> they<00:02:00.060> were

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
piles and reduce them so that they were

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.289 
piles and reduce them so that they were
no<00:02:00.270> longer<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.780> risk<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.469> fire<00:02:01.710> severity<00:02:02.299> pile
