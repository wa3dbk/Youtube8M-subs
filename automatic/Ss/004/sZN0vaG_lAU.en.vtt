to start with is probably the most
simple<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.600> actually<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.260> also

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
simple one but it's actually it's also

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
simple one but it's actually it's also
very<00:00:25.949> versatile<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:27.599> use<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> lot<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
very versatile can use it in a lot of

very versatile can use it in a lot of
different<00:00:28.439> styles<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:29.220> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> different

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
different styles a lot of different

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.860 
different styles a lot of different
contexts<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> power<00:00:32.219> chord

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
contexts and it's just a power chord

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.330 
contexts and it's just a power chord
which<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.170> you've<00:00:34.500> played<00:00:34.680> any<00:00:34.920> guitars

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which if you've played any guitars

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.830 
which if you've played any guitars
probably<00:00:36.059> something<00:00:36.329> you're<00:00:36.390> familiar<00:00:36.540> with

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
probably something you're familiar with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
probably something you're familiar with
because<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> first<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.280> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
because it's like the first thing you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760 
because it's like the first thing you
learn<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.420> rock<00:00:39.719> guitar<00:00:40.110> player<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.469> learn

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
learn as a rock guitar player you learn

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.049 
learn as a rock guitar player you learn
a<00:00:40.800> power<00:00:41.070> chord<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.520> then<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> never<00:00:41.820> learn

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a power chord and then you never learn

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
a power chord and then you never learn
anything<00:00:42.210> ever<00:00:42.660> again<00:00:43.340> um<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.079> here's<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anything ever again um so here's that so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.639 
anything ever again um so here's that so
basically<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.350> pick

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
basically all we're going to do is pick

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.600 
basically all we're going to do is pick
a<00:00:49.680> root

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a root

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.330 
a root
I'll<00:00:51.180> use<00:00:51.390> e<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> second<00:00:52.890> fret<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> D

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I'll use e on the second fret of the D

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.660 
I'll use e on the second fret of the D
string<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> play<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> root<00:00:55.800> along<00:00:56.489> with

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
string and you play the root along with

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.630 
string and you play the root along with
its<00:00:56.850> v<00:00:57.239> which<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> B<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> play<00:00:59.550> on

its v which is a B I'm going to play on

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.610 
its v which is a B I'm going to play on
the<00:00:59.730> g<00:00:59.910> string<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> 4th<00:01:00.539> fret<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.410> I've<00:01:01.469> got

the g string on the 4th fret so I've got

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.729 
the g string on the 4th fret so I've got
root<00:01:01.890> v<00:01:02.300> that's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.390> power<00:01:03.570> chord<00:01:03.930> root<00:01:04.350> 5th

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
root v that's a power chord root 5th

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.740 
root v that's a power chord root 5th
it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.400> note<00:01:05.549> chord

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.490 

do<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.840> feel<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.470> power<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:14.250> feel<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> power

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
do you feel the power I feel the power

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.819 
do you feel the power I feel the power
so<00:01:17.500> it's<00:01:18.130> very<00:01:18.250> simple<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:20.380> slide<00:01:20.649> the

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
so it's very simple you just slide the

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.090 
so it's very simple you just slide the
shape<00:01:21.039> around<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:22.210> sounds<00:01:22.600> like<00:01:22.630> rock<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
shape around and it sounds like rock it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.649 
shape around and it sounds like rock it
doesn't<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.580> sound<00:01:24.759> like<00:01:24.880> rock<00:01:25.119> but<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
doesn't have to sound like rock but it

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.999 
doesn't have to sound like rock but it
can<00:01:25.810> easily<00:01:25.840> sound<00:01:26.320> like<00:01:26.470> rock<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:28.860> we'll<00:01:29.860> just

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
can easily sound like rock so we'll just

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.800 
can easily sound like rock so we'll just
make<00:01:30.220> up<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.490> little<00:01:30.670> bass<00:01:30.880> line<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.659> get

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
make up a little bass line here to get

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.690 
make up a little bass line here to get
used<00:01:32.079> to<00:01:32.200> sliding<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.829> around<00:01:33.159> I'm<00:01:33.460> going<00:01:33.579> to

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
used to sliding that around I'm going to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.340 
used to sliding that around I'm going to
strum<00:01:34.090> it<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.670> way<00:01:36.789> stomach<00:01:37.299> guitars<00:01:37.630> kind<00:01:38.289> of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
strum it the way stomach guitars kind of

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.630 
strum it the way stomach guitars kind of
with<00:01:38.439> all<00:01:38.560> your<00:01:38.710> fingers<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.429> I'm<00:01:42.429> going<00:01:42.610> to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
with all your fingers and I'm going to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
with all your fingers and I'm going to
go<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:43.240> this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.870 

so<00:02:02.560> it's<00:02:02.710> kind<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:02.950> built<00:02:03.159> around<00:02:03.280> an<00:02:03.490> e-minor

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
so it's kind of built around an e-minor

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.450 
so it's kind of built around an e-minor
scale<00:02:04.180> I'm<00:02:04.540> just<00:02:04.750> doing<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.080> same<00:02:05.290> cord<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:06.399> a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
scale I'm just doing the same cord on a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:16.680 
scale I'm just doing the same cord on a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
can't see my dots but they are there so

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
can't see my dots but they are there so
I'll<00:02:20.800> play<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.190> again<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:21.790> play

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
I'll play that again and you can play

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:45.420 
I'll play that again and you can play
along<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.630> two<00:02:23.319> three<00:02:24.069> four<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
along with me two three four so the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.190 
along with me two three four so the
exact<00:02:46.150> strumming<00:02:46.540> pattern<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.019> right

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
exact strumming pattern with the right

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.080 
exact strumming pattern with the right
hand<00:02:47.440> doesn't<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.830> matter<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.790> idea<00:02:49.030> is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
hand doesn't really matter the idea is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.300 
hand doesn't really matter the idea is
to<00:02:49.269> just<00:02:49.510> start<00:02:50.350> moving<00:02:50.769> around<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
to just start moving around with the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.009 
to just start moving around with the
power<00:02:51.519> chords<00:02:52.060> experiment<00:02:52.780> with<00:02:52.870> some

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
power chords experiment with some

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.039 
power chords experiment with some
different<00:02:53.410> ideas<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.900> good

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
different ideas you know that's a good

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.069 
different ideas you know that's a good
one<00:02:59.260> the<00:03:00.220> idea<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.700> take<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.780> cord

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
one the idea is to just take the cord

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.490 
one the idea is to just take the cord
and<00:03:02.200> see<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.310> do<00:03:03.489> with<00:03:03.640> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and see what you can do with it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.530 
and see what you can do with it
