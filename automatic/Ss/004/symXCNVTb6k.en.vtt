right<00:02:19.360> on<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.690> edge<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:22.030> a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
right on the edge there and I get a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.490 
right on the edge there and I get a
little<00:02:22.360> section<00:02:23.580> wet

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
little section wet

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.540 
little section wet
start<00:02:27.220> off<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:27.610> one<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.820> our<00:02:27.970> straight<00:02:28.390> edges

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
start off with one of our straight edges

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.890 
start off with one of our straight edges
I'm<00:02:30.550> going<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.850> place<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.330> very<00:02:31.750> carefully

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
I'm going to place it very carefully

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.730 
I'm going to place it very carefully
right<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.740> crease<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.500> take<00:02:38.710> a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
right on that crease and then take a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.730 
right on that crease and then take a
little<00:02:38.920> bit<00:02:39.070> more<00:02:39.160> Mod<00:02:39.610> Podge<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.570> go<00:02:41.170> over<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
little bit more Mod Podge and go over it

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.220 
little bit more Mod Podge and go over it
and<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.040> be<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.730> generous<00:02:43.120> with<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and you can be really generous with the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.670 
and you can be really generous with the
Mod<00:02:44.410> Podge<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.880> top<00:02:46.480> layer<00:02:46.780> get<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.200> really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
Mod Podge on the top layer get it really

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.870 
Mod Podge on the top layer get it really
in<00:02:47.950> there<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.490> even<00:02:48.700> use<00:02:48.850> your

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
in there and you can even use your

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.800 
in there and you can even use your
fingers<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.720> kind<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.050> lay<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.320> down

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
fingers and just kind of lay it down

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.980 
fingers and just kind of lay it down
yeah<00:02:54.090> little<00:02:55.090> bit<00:02:55.240> because<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.630> want<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
yeah little bit because you want it to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.250 
yeah little bit because you want it to
really<00:02:56.410> be<00:02:57.570> saturated<00:02:58.570> in<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.080> it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
really be saturated in so that it's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.590 
really be saturated in so that it's
sticks<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.070> stays<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:01.240> don't<00:03:01.390> want<00:03:01.510> to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
sticks and it stays you don't want to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.580 
sticks and it stays you don't want to
risk<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.200> not<00:03:02.350> staying<00:03:03.390> here<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.510> go<00:03:04.720> kind<00:03:05.440> of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
risk it not staying here we go kind of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.650 
risk it not staying here we go kind of
wipe<00:03:06.130> off<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:06.970> use<00:03:07.120> your<00:03:07.150> fingers

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
wipe off you can just use your fingers

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.640 
wipe off you can just use your fingers
for<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> excess<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:09.000> again<00:03:10.410> nice<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
for the excess and again nice and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.460 
for the excess and again nice and
generous<00:03:12.360> right<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.720> edges<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
generous right on the edges and the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.680 
generous right on the edges and the
creases<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.340> want<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.940> see<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.270> Mod<00:03:16.420> Podge

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
creases you want to see the Mod Podge

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.310 
creases you want to see the Mod Podge
kind<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.170> going<00:03:17.410> underneath<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.310> inside<00:03:19.320> so

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
kind of going underneath and inside so

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.610 
kind of going underneath and inside so
that<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:21.010> sticks<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:21.910> stays<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.660> then

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that it really sticks and stays and then

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.710 
that it really sticks and stays and then
you<00:03:23.740> can<00:03:23.920> just<00:03:24.100> wipe<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.460> and<00:03:25.210> kind<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.540> take

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you can just wipe that and kind of take

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720 
you can just wipe that and kind of take
your<00:03:25.900> finger<00:03:26.230> over<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.770> piece<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.610> it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
your finger over the piece so that it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.310 
your finger over the piece so that it
doesn't<00:03:29.370> dry<00:03:30.370> with<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.270> white<00:03:31.480> color<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.959> top

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
doesn't dry with the white color on top

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.820 
doesn't dry with the white color on top
of<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.890> want<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> dry<00:03:33.550> clear<00:03:34.090> um<00:03:34.660> so<00:03:35.620> if

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
of it you want it to dry clear um so if

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.410 
of it you want it to dry clear um so if
it's<00:03:36.010> too<00:03:36.250> thick<00:03:36.520> it'll<00:03:36.820> dry<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.090> little<00:03:37.270> bit

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's too thick it'll dry a little bit

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.610 
it's too thick it'll dry a little bit
white<00:03:37.800> you<00:03:38.800> want<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.280> kind<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.620> okay

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
so I'm going to just finish up a couple

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.790 
so I'm going to just finish up a couple
more<00:03:44.040> sections<00:03:45.040> here<00:03:45.550> so<00:03:46.120> I'm<00:03:46.540> almost<00:03:47.530> done

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
more sections here so I'm almost done

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.040 
more sections here so I'm almost done
I've<00:03:48.070> got<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.550> little<00:03:49.209> bit<00:03:49.330> more<00:03:49.510> than<00:03:49.690> half<00:03:49.900> of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
I've got a little bit more than half of

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.420 
I've got a little bit more than half of
it<00:03:50.700> complete<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.570> I'm<00:03:53.530> going<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.830> go<00:03:53.950> ahead<00:03:54.130> and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
it complete so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610 
it complete so I'm going to go ahead and
just<00:03:54.580> start<00:03:54.820> covering<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:55.989> from<00:03:56.380> this

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
just start covering it now from this

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.790 
just start covering it now from this
edge<00:03:56.950> over<00:03:57.910> this<00:03:58.090> way<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.170> both<00:03:59.410> sides

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
edge over this way so that both sides

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.400 
edge over this way so that both sides
kind<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.310> cover<00:04:00.580> each<00:04:00.850> other<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:02.320> not

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
kind of cover each other and it's not

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.440 
kind of cover each other and it's not
all<00:04:02.650> just<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:03.250> way<00:04:03.459> over<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.060> it's<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.300> lot

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
all just one way over and it's a lot

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.540 
all just one way over and it's a lot
easier<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.900> start<00:04:04.959> on<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.410> edges<00:04:05.800> anyway<00:04:06.340> as

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
easier to start on the edges anyway as

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.509 
easier to start on the edges anyway as
opposed<00:04:07.269> to<00:04:07.390> starting<00:04:07.660> over<00:04:07.959> here<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.769> trying

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
opposed to starting over here and trying

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.050 
opposed to starting over here and trying
to<00:04:09.700> get<00:04:09.940> an<00:04:10.090> edge<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.780> line<00:04:11.290> up<00:04:11.470> perfectly<00:04:12.070> with

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
to get an edge to line up perfectly with

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.360 
to get an edge to line up perfectly with
the<00:04:13.420> front<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> heel<00:04:14.170> there<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:14.680> I'm<00:04:15.160> going

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
the front of the heel there so I'm going

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.790 
the front of the heel there so I'm going
to<00:04:15.459> go<00:04:15.550> ahead<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.910> just<00:04:16.030> finish<00:04:16.269> this

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
to go ahead and just finish this

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.120 
to go ahead and just finish this
so<00:04:18.800> as<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.460> can<00:04:19.610> see<00:04:19.670> um<00:04:20.600> everything<00:04:21.470> looks

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
so as you can see um everything looks

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.130 
so as you can see um everything looks
like<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:22.520> fitted<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.060> really<00:04:23.420> tightly<00:04:23.900> and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
like it's fitted in really tightly and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.550 
like it's fitted in really tightly and
snugly<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:25.540> there's<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.600> lot<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.110> different

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
snugly and there's a lot of different

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.100 
snugly and there's a lot of different
edges<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:28.280> different<00:04:28.670> shape<00:04:29.660> there's<00:04:29.900> really

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
edges and different shape there's really
