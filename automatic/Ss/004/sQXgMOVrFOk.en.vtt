00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 we have a final video with maxim 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.340
 that is, such a small instructive 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 the story that is if you sit down to count 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.839
 specifically the construction project your yes that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.440
 have you counted the timber counted with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.690
 frame 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.080
 besides you take for example 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.029
 videos that have been shot but also they have 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 each video if you take a profitable 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.269
 the house is a time period that is you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.939
 see the time period which 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.940
 would be required from one procedure to another 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.190
 in time you will be guided 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 time gradient you should consider 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 if i go to work i get impaired 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.590
 there suppose up to 1000 rubles there up to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.809
 2000 rubles to count the amount 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.920
 time you will be there 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.860
 big pile tool wagging 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.260
 buildings with some suppose in the rain and 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.600
 slush and so on sunny bright day 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.059
 when do you think too hard 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.070
 the amount of time you are 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.670
 need to invest you don't want 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.530
 not working just a day deserter get away 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.030
 useful work you do not pay for work 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 well, yes mounted 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.470
 either you just attach a log house 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.210
 children for 150 rubles each to come 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.090
 day check you take off log 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.030
 the house you count the amount of timber 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.550
 amount of work and it turns out that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.710
 it may be 25 percent. 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.310
 will it be cheaper to even build a house from 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.360
 twenty twenty two centimeters 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.539
 why talk about twenty two 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 centimeters for Tomsk Novosibirsk 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.759
 now suppose you don't need 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.440
 so warm home but then after how much 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.950
 you're thirty years old i'm 32 but substances 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.110
 another will be held on October 15 year-old children are on their way 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.440
 then I think now 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.980
 that 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.990
 go to nature grow on 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.620
 foods suppose a date if 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.660
 Generally syroed eat there about Russians 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.550
 the most sprouting buckwheat 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.760
 a tire this year that is salads 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.400
 i.e 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.890
 what can you live on so simply not 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.650
 bothers they love enough 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.490
 economy build mode bought 50 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.310
 kilogram buckwheat seeds or germinated 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.740
 kill so much salad just have time 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.020
 you are fed up like so this is all 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.660
 calculate and it will be optimal 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.270
 invest it all make a house because 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.840
 15 centimeters will not be purged enough 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.670
 20 Well, wherever my parent is 18 but 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.640
 cool 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.500
 if you make 22 or normal 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.930
 normal criteria when do more 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.860
 plaster under the frame there warm on 3 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.440
 centimeter get it around 250 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.540
 good warm capacious heavy construction 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.890
 which will regulate well a 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 fluid inside 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.350
 plaster from there and add clay 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 then she is a community of cool surprise then 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.760
 there is she excess moisture here takes 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.290
 skips and removes from home firstly 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.200
 it will be environmentally friendly 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 secondly it never burns out from within 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.140
 leaves your lutece 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.840
 either thin csp by 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.060
 Sven gap suppose to either flat 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.700
 Slate count can be through 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.790
 skype cheaper 12 top ten lead very 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.200
 flexible but instead of flat slate is quite 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.400
 that is suitable as an external 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.330
 finish this buffer will fit quietly 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.250
 that is, the house shrinks go can 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.740
 for example take a makita vansky plane 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.860
 15 wide 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 very good will be outside by these two 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.980
 to the parties 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.190
 from the inside out quickly just 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.870
 scold plane hay useful and then 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.850
 time when the house will shrink you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.560
 can live in peace or house will 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.630
 comfortable meaning you can some 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.459
 there is ground drift on suppose 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.330
 Sinatra outside is already covered with something 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.300
 dark kendo 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.220
 the same has a finished look not so much 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.390
 he is in the process in a year or two 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.640
 will be sheathed 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.760
 she will have a clear finished look 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.200
 already visual at heart will be calm then 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.930
 ru there jars outside to inside 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.550
 walked on the course volume and it will be but 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.130
 already as if there should be 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.450
 and then the need may have appeared 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.810
 you need when will not appear 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.210
 suppose the plaster inside can you 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 it will be like that and we put it on there 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.360
 rope or rope 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.569
 it was their easy men patched up 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.280
 assume decorative imitation 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.919
 something there ship style such 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.069
 when u live there don't burn if that 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.990
 country house that's all you need all 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.289
 just count count count 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.970
 count another category of time on another 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.400
 times is important and this is me 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.050
 there was a time for building an apartment house 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.330
 Kira 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:56.669
 the ark because she was there 2012 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:59.490
 there I pampered made another 60 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.210
 centimeters warm floor youtube talk 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.210
 here 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.279
 polystyrene on behalf of the bottom can really 

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:09.169
 fall when in a day we try on that 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.509
 set 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.249
 just really brow we went on 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.620
 beautiful here was the time I did it 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:17.650
 engaged in parallel what is the income and so 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.960
 Further, that is, when you need to count 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.669
 if if you have an income category from it 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.770
 yes it is necessary to calculate everything to be 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.349
 look quality sometimes 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.539
 specialist is better than you there three times 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.639
 spent more time and the same 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.430
 result but temporarily three times more 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.259
 It will be put to leave the forces and all the talk 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.569
 20 kilometers from the city may already be there 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:42.710
 strong on the flight anyway work all 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:45.110
 will still be well here is the whole nation so 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.150
 everything will be attentive so if this 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.129
 country house right to do and 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.060
 recommendations for heating to 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.090
 pleasing contour 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.470
 coolants on non-freezing because 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.660
 that even if he didn't freeze there before 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.600
 density but warms nowhere not pipes not 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.210
 break the surname expansion tank 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.400
 and after some amount of time 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.140
 decide to finish the attic was to appear 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.450
 financial opportunities better animations 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.190
 tuning fork after a while when 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.700
 inside on campus everything is ready when s give 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.320
 shrinkage and naturalness 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.360
 materials have already understood themselves 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.530
 sense to think about it because even 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.930
 mineral wool itself 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.820
 it can be cheaper i can it 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.860
 just like natural materials 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.000
 but the equivalent of time is first 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.400
 then it will be necessary to change if 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.740
 the skeletons then have some on 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.510
 Russian to remove the twist to 5 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.920
 general then she really appreciates with 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.670
 every year or loses all technical 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.770
 abilities 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.240
 because the amount of fluid that 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.490
 it still passes through it 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.400
 sooner or later you aim it 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.630
 definitely no heat capacity 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.900
 at home therefore 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.249
 in your case your case you make 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.469
 home 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:55.569
 correct conclusions that is like maxim 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.309
 how to contact me with 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.659
 with requests to control them on 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:01.179
 technological percentage that is how would 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:02.589
 we will start with a dense about this plan 

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:04.760
 to do that is if he decides 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:06.380
 by myself 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.780
 construction will just leave 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.950
 watch shoot videos 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.960
 negotiated as it should be properly 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.030
 manifest that is how we are together at night is 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.780
 do as far as possible in time 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.270
 and it will be the same 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.830
 the result is that he would for example be 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.840
 This was done by a man who is there 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.370
 For a long time engaged in building type 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.930
 english mode 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.930
 so probably on 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:35.240
 the video will end consultation with 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:40.850
 Maxim Maxim Many thanks to the audience 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.870
 thanks for our 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.550
 informative 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.170
 not close and brains 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.170
 we were Sergey Maxim and dates
