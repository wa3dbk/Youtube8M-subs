00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
and i think that uh not saying anything
is<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.970> worse<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.540> coming<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.200> telling

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
is way worse than coming out and telling
the<00:01:25.530> truth<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> saying<00:01:26.100> hey<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the truth and saying hey it's it's

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
the truth and saying hey it's it's
coming<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.750> later<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.080> know

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
coming out a little bit later you know

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200

anyway<00:01:28.590> though<00:01:28.710> um<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> most

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
anyway though um so that's the most
