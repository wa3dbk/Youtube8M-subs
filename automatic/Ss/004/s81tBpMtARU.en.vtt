 knows he never got there without so 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 since my beginning I wanted to make a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 video ensures that the victim is great 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.990
 sport always after that since I 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 a voice tic or maintaining 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.400
 it started it was 2011 2010 I know 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.810
 more if you like nxp saporta you had me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 made you want to make videos and I 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 started on iphone axes and a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.070
 miserable quality that exceeds the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 140p and now I 'm here 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.790
 recorded split ps3 and with TV 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 Swiss that I am so right now 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.860
 I do not have a lot of videos but it's 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469
 because 14 his show poultry and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 to the yankees at this moment more ample and 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.910
 so the Segovians several times then 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.440
 I take advantage of the little moments of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.940
 free time to make a video this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.940
 work to show my space 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.650
 I know my advantage does not play the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.930
 good time with posts at the cays 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.580
 and so that's all in all that's all and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.950
 I detached for April be ok on 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.630
 feet so we end up all of 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.990
 after that I was task and my device 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.790
 there we can see my ps3 which removes w so 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.010
 an official without anything at all I have a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.410
 well hack on the one I have 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 bought in 2009 because mafate labaki was 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.060
 60 gigas it's my year 320 that has me 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.760
 dropped I had it on the second day 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.649
 after the release in March and she told me 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.810
 dropped summer 2009 and we had separated by 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.229
 mg france had lasted only two days with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 the means of the time and knock the ai there 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.750
 we are there aude and because I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.630
 hold the brickyard in 2002 that I had 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.300
 facts prepared by a boxing ninja who 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 know each other and there are 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.140
 trailers now what I already had 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.539
 breaké I made bullshit too 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.360
 alas there is marex who in four points 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.310
 41 so that's a rule 4.21 the base is 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 here to do real time so she 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.890
 is in a carnage duel 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.720
 for those who know about it after 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.110
 rest will simply drop 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.660
 you can see my screen that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.280
 80 cm so good special for gaming and 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.900
 their good response time that old but 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.550
 no except this screen you can even 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.550
 add on meerman I delete people 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.720
 well when I can I scrutinize people 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.290
 so I 'm doing some tuning 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.520
 that's after where you're going to see but 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.690
 really all the games it's really a 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.100
 crazy thing not what I say since 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.720
 the beginning the ps3 had seen there that I have not 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.060
 could sell because it's really a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.710
 season a misery honestly that you 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.300
 roulette virtua tennis finally I really 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 a lot of game if you send a who 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.760
 please tell me if you want 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 also I think of a video on it there 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.060
 no problem I am at your disposal 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 so you tell me among the games you 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.560
 see is on trial limited and call of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.360
 I sold none of my first 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.360
 call of duty it was call of duty 4 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.769
 call of duty 4 that I have 10 years and n 2 and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.120
 I wrote month did four times the mode 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.010
 campaign and when I understood that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.550
 could play online and I loved it 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.890
 that and we need old games 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.360
 respond to me on pc and me on 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.069
 ps3 I was doing here you're not what we 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.660
 could play keyboard on ps3 wager 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.920
 that to expose by the specialists there I 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.560
 the redis my region that allows to do 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.980
 real time so to connect the cable 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.930
 ethernet that is there I plug the cable 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.310
 ethernet to my laptop that is 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.849
 plugged into wifi that makes a sharing of 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.769
 connection with my ps3 rex to do the 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.540
 lobbys blow all the bullshit we 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.980
 can make their tripods that is done 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.870
 for the mx 1000 which is my device 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.640
 Photo 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.140
 so 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.360
 I'm trying to focus but 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 I do not know I have everything new so 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.190
 I have trouble making the adjustments 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.020
 in real time after we will go to my 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.610
 ordi who is really I play that who 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.770
 was a copy that was made by my 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.230
 father and I do components and he 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.880
 helped me back up 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.430
 so they date a year ago the copy that there 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:57.760
 I will change some bath elements 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:59.170
 Swiss or a core i5 2500k you make 3,3 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.840
 giguère because I had over clock 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.070
 but I put them back normal I 'm recording 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.480
 many people ask me what I 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.410
 the recorded i repeat it hdp green for 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.450
 not that they take the lead but 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.420
 I really record with that which is the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.760
 their media tv a hd capture game so 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.170
 I found a glitch to record 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.120
 my ps3 who in hdmi 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.489
 I show you right away my 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.990
 principle is simple is that we leave the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.110
 port hdmi who is there and he is going 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.630
 yeah you will surely follow and who 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.820
 will take root in this splitter hdmi which 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.250
 will divide the signal into two parts 1 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.260
 which was worth to my TV there and another one that 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.520
 was worth Normandy in the pci card because 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.680
 that it's a pci card what you 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.200
 want to see there is a lot of 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.390
 pci doors on general motherboards 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.690
 like like a graphics card be 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.240
 plugged in is saved like that and there 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.160
 can see my screen in real time I 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.960
 go out my screen but there was a delay of 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.960
 latency which is not negligible 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.819
 my little I ramble 6850 so I do 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.969
 turn all the games of the contributions of the 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.199
 tram and all the games well we'll say and 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.399
 it's a rock at the time 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.319
 because it does not cost much and is 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:16.209
 really sheltered from the wind i have an asus 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:19.270
 dh 67 and here I bought a cd for the 

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:21.899
 last month and it was 240 ch ecafe 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:26.830
 month the focus 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:31.300
 that's 240 giga which allows the computer to 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.909
 standards and wants to break my life 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:40.300
 screen that he has nothing special on screen 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:43.340
 so kind with the media washer license 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.560
 like that since I changed the software 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.180
 to be able to record in hdmi to 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880
 can my performance index be 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.950
 to return that I have 24 GB of ram so 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.450
 the critical friends is me and I had 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.600
 had a price on both bars and eight 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.840
 so g24 giga so it serves for the 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.520
 renderings and play at the same time 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.630
 I record with me slides my actions 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.150
 pc and I do the editing with sony vegas 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.490
 this point I record my voice with a 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.650
 ulm 30 for comments and in 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.820
 deferred and there you are my tender cushion 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.250
 in which I get angry when I rage 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.710
 when decerto and georgia most 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.230
 of my voice with this mic because she 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.150
 is breaking that is a term peasant so 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.440
 really very practical like 15 who is 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.390
 that they have a longer duration of 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.490
 life of this game labaki triton that 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:39.110
 is no longer useful to me since there is 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.900
 the lkp that broke so I hope that 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.460
 the city of you will have liked 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.660
 well if you're not good at my 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.380
 bitch and you can do a little 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.120
 tower 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.100
 if you discover the video like that I 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.750
 know that animals that's the end of 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.070
 the video I hope will not want me anymore 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.960
 does it go too fast 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.940
 I have everything 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.590
 I did not prepare anything for that I did not talk 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.590
 but I of course but at the level of my 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.819
 oral I apologize if I'm looking for my dad 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.789
 no leaf so I hope it does not 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.370
 will be more of a master stroke with at the 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:10.220
 video it became a comment if 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.919
 you have questions about this 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.889
 man there behind you not necessarily 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:23.030
 both by two 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:24.499
 is not it also doubled tell you 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.840
 I would like to make video is real 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:31.550
 since this in both senses not very 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:34.930
 funny and actually I'm a little funny I 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.930
 am funny actually not in absolute 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.440
 and
