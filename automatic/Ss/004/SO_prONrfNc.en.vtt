I'm very excited and you go that's
portable<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.760> saw<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.450> circular<00:03:07.260> saw<00:03:07.470> as

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
portable I would saw and circular saw as

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.430 
portable I would saw and circular saw as
it<00:03:08.130> says<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:10.459> yeah<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.700> think<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.150> need<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.870> show

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
it says and yeah I think I need to show

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.870 
it says and yeah I think I need to show
you<00:03:13.970> how<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.090> works<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:18.319> hope<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.440> works<00:03:19.880> but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
you how it works so I hope it works but

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.420 
you how it works so I hope it works but
it's<00:03:21.299> sweeping<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:22.769> with<00:03:22.919> engineering

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it's sweeping so if with engineering

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.210 
it's sweeping so if with engineering
engineering<00:03:23.819> out<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:24.599> I'm<00:03:25.019> quite<00:03:25.410> solid<00:03:25.859> it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
engineering out so I'm quite solid it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.680 
engineering out so I'm quite solid it
should<00:03:26.430> work<00:03:26.639> properly<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:31.310> are<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.430> ready

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
should work properly so are you ready

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.159 
should work properly so are you ready
let's<00:03:33.690> count

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
let's count

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:57.479
