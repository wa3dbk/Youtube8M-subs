00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
is also in this 157 triad so that really

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.740 
is also in this 157 triad so that really
enhances<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.600> well<00:00:49.039> now<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.789> moon<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
enhances it as well now the moon is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.920 
enhances it as well now the moon is
forming<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> grand<00:00:53.219> trine<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> grand<00:00:54.719> trine

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
forming a grand trine and a grand trine

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.330 
forming a grand trine and a grand trine
is<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:56.039> beneficial<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> wonderful

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
is very very beneficial it's a wonderful

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.110 
is very very beneficial it's a wonderful
astrology<00:00:59.340> sacred<00:01:00.210> geometric<00:01:01.100> triangle<00:01:02.120> so

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
astrology sacred geometric triangle so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.390 
astrology sacred geometric triangle so
it's<00:01:03.270> three<00:01:03.510> times<00:01:03.690> 120<00:01:04.409> degrees<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's three times 120 degrees and so the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's three times 120 degrees and so the
moon<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.000> forming<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.479> grand<00:01:06.750> trine<00:01:07.020> with

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
moon is forming this grand trine with

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
moon is forming this grand trine with
Uranus<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.540> Jupiter<00:01:10.229> Venus

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
Uranus and with that Jupiter Venus

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
Uranus and with that Jupiter Venus
conjunction<00:01:11.790> which<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.869> on

there's still pretty close to each other
there<00:01:16.229> within<00:01:16.439> three<00:01:16.860> three<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> half

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
there within three three and a half

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.370 
there within three three and a half
degrees<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.060> each<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.900> that's<00:01:19.049> still
