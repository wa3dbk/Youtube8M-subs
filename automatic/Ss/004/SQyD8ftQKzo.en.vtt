00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.430
 with each set 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.459

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.859
 souilhe citizens 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.209
 you will see this part I do not have too much how we do not know 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.209
 think the gameplay speaks for itself says 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 picture the moment 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.669
 it's being a hell of a match going expenses have bet simple gameplay 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.499
 speaking interests 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.269
 alain parent can not talk about many very important things and to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 the first one she knows I do not know if you saw the lack of 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.150
 puget sound previous video 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.240
 there is this impression in the country 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.590
 socrates was not so many goals 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.560
 but if you know that the first goal we come to empty like his father 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 to go the nile day to day thank you really because I was not expecting 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.130
 as many games 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.390
 to ask him to change 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.710
 m but the success is there so there 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 so here I am thank you 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.010
 That makes me very happy 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 then I want to talk about them 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.950
 2 thing 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.180
 a little a bigger one 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.010
 still 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.550
 2 question its volume 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.530
 often in the early hours of Wednesday 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 on my wife 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.770
 the communication is that which explains all small and cries fell that day 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 pause someone what you do not use that lÃ¼thi 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.620
 percent in justice but it's all alex proyas 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.030
 for the rest of the country 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 a game 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 timothy geithner 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.110
 the rout the free kicks 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.220
 the inscriptions for his first debate place as we 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.760
 I think you'll like it 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.320
 nicolas in a configuration use for known players who have what 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.380
 we will find so I think his plan the crisis 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 like that over five million we tried to protest they were 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.049
 burned 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.290
 news 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.760
 m and then the second question that came back a lot 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 it does not begin 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.010
 do you want to ask why do you also have to 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.619
 our team 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.749
 it's a skating thing of myself we're all going to buy 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.749
 so we understand that it's still worth it in advance 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.269
 the world plays 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.290
 so know coppens laurans nor newspapers have ideas above and that's a 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.399
 excellent 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.719
 but they can also follow 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.989
 according to 95% chance launched on the theme that finds 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.029
 so my pleasure 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.079
 employees 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.079
 in fact on the floor between make it grow 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.929
 thank you not at all it's always 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:44.359
 peasants and have raised like the other 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.579
 dumas in how are both if some 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.840
 they have been told about me you have to understand it 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.690
 after it's on me for example I have a little preference for my 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.360
 upset because beyond the columns of the 10 sports my thing all 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.059
 simply 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:03.730
 then will come the turn that one speaks of saying more than 6,300 detainees colonies 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.109
 bishops who is important 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.930
 it's a certain sense of our mission it's like comparing 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.929
 Helen Kohl, he said, but let's talk thanks 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:17.549
 these testimonies indicate that his family is a business of 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.999
 permanent demolition without lisandro 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.189
 all the gratin was different so when stop comparing the two 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.129
 tenths of a second our five in 2006 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.129
 c afp 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.820
 a duty for this question 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.039
 I think about the article r 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.039
 Celine I hope you train imposed 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.739
 a year for so that's insults 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.939
 it's clean 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.689
 lotto 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.419
 I panicked you have to take into account know that a 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.669
 because for a year 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.709
 by the way 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.799
 the refereed 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.049
 the only goal of the mullahs they are less good too on the chain 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.829
 for you to have a try at the promoter a 100 bail where 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.599
 do I master it 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.849
 on a gameplay 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.969
 at the start of a gameplay video I do not know earlier 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.919
 yes but still not tell his name of the troop 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.090
 a video 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.949
 for sure I hope so it does not bother a scoop 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.129
 cambon 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.879
 m then when my grandmother had asked me to leave me your impressions 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.360
 in the comments of the first video 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.819
 the DG of tourism we liked it 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.319
 pleased with what is said 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.289
 super complicated things that no part-taking month a year spits out 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.909
 fire at all 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:40.949
 m so here we go 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.809

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:48.529

 places of life as if this guy 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.240
 however in one hand the other having no problem 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.669
 allard this part ends with a fullness 2 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.819
