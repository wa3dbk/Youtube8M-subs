00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.229 
we get a quick score because in games
like<00:03:49.800> this<00:03:50.130> where<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.850> kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.120> a

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
like this where it's kind of a

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.030 
like this where it's kind of a
back-and-forth<00:03:51.690> thing<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.590> want<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.890> have

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
back-and-forth thing you want to have

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.790 
back-and-forth thing you want to have
the<00:03:53.220> ball<00:03:53.430> last<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.180> felt<00:03:54.480> if<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.350> took<00:03:55.410> too

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
the ball last and I felt if I took too

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.890 
the ball last and I felt if I took too
much<00:03:55.950> time<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.700> last<00:03:57.120> Drive<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.780> then

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
much time on that last Drive and then

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900 
much time on that last Drive and then
scored<00:03:58.260> he<00:03:59.010> probably<00:03:59.340> would<00:03:59.550> have<00:03:59.610> had<00:03:59.760> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
scored he probably would have had the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.229 
scored he probably would have had the
ball<00:04:00.090> last<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.690> big<00:04:01.230> touchdown<00:04:02.070> quickly<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
ball last so a big touchdown quickly and

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.350 
ball last so a big touchdown quickly and
then<00:04:03.480> look<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.110> gets<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.280> snot<00:04:06.030> knocked

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
then look at that gets the snot knocked

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.900 
then look at that gets the snot knocked
