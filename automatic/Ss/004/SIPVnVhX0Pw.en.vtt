wildlife<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.920> not<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.070> dumb

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
wildlife right there not just dumb

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.340 
wildlife right there not just dumb
animals<00:00:44.820> they're<00:00:45.059> intelligent<00:00:45.600> sort<00:00:46.260> of

that with the monsters it's like not

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.750 
that with the monsters it's like not
really<00:01:21.740> sure<00:01:21.950> what<00:01:22.130> these<00:01:22.220> guys<00:01:22.400> are<00:01:22.460> all

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
really sure what these guys are all

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.450 
really sure what these guys are all
about<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:23.840> they're<00:01:24.380> they're<00:01:24.770> really<00:01:25.130> scary

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
about but they're they're really scary

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.770 
about but they're they're really scary
and<00:01:25.670> they're<00:01:25.940> really<00:01:26.150> messing<00:01:26.780> stuff<00:01:26.900> up<00:01:31.780> it's

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
and they're really messing stuff up it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.870 
and they're really messing stuff up it's
definitely<00:01:32.960> different<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.920> wildlife<00:01:34.399> you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
definitely different the wildlife you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.330 
definitely different the wildlife you
know<00:01:35.000> have<00:01:35.240> rules<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:36.050> they<00:01:36.080> follow<00:01:36.410> right<00:01:37.310> i

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
know have rules that they follow right i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.100 
know have rules that they follow right i
mean<00:01:37.520> certainly<00:01:37.910> we<00:01:38.240> don't<00:01:38.420> ever<00:01:38.570> want<00:01:38.840> things

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
mean certainly we don't ever want things

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.230 
mean certainly we don't ever want things
to<00:01:39.320> get<00:01:39.410> too<00:01:39.979> boring<00:01:40.399> particularly<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
to get too boring particularly in the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.550 
to get too boring particularly in the
early<00:01:41.300> on<00:01:41.570> when<00:01:41.780> you're<00:01:41.899> trying<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.170> find<00:01:42.440> the

early on when you're trying to find the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.380 
early on when you're trying to find the
monster<00:01:42.740> i<00:01:42.979> mean<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.220> really<00:01:43.640> good<00:01:43.820> sneaky

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.949 
was in left 4 dead but we've got sort of
a<00:01:58.100> variant<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.090> functions<00:01:59.330> much<00:01:59.750> the

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
a variant of that it functions much the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.660 
a variant of that it functions much the
same<00:02:00.110> way<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.160> gives<00:02:01.490> you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
same way and that you know it gives you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.480 
same way and that you know it gives you
some<00:02:01.850> highs<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.060> some<00:02:02.479> logos<00:02:03.160> you<00:02:04.160> know<00:02:04.220> keeps

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
some highs and some logos you know keeps

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.260 
some highs and some logos you know keeps
things<00:02:04.729> fresh

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.200 

we've<00:02:10.900> got<00:02:11.080> four<00:02:11.470> hunter<00:02:12.210> classes

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
we've got four hunter classes

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.330 
we've got four hunter classes
essentially<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.590> first<00:02:14.800> one<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.040> probably

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
essentially the first one and probably

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.460 
essentially the first one and probably
the<00:02:15.610> most<00:02:15.760> straightforward<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.960> assault

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the most straightforward is the assault

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.980 
the most straightforward is the assault
class<00:02:17.680> he's<00:02:18.460> all<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.450> dealing<00:02:19.900> as

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
class he's all about just dealing as

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.230 
class he's all about just dealing as
much<00:02:20.020> damage<00:02:20.470> as<00:02:20.710> possible<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.640> second<00:02:22.030> one

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
much damage as possible the second one

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840 
much damage as possible the second one
it<00:02:22.600> would<00:02:23.080> be<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:23.980> medic<00:02:24.250> class<00:02:24.370> again

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
it would be the the medic class again

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.330 
it would be the the medic class again
you<00:02:25.240> know<00:02:25.330> medic<00:02:25.930> class<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.320> pretty<00:02:26.890> obvious

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
you know medic class is pretty obvious

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.460 
you know medic class is pretty obvious
the<00:02:27.610> medics<00:02:27.880> also<00:02:28.180> have<00:02:28.450> sort<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.050> secondary

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the medics also have sort of a secondary

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.050 
the medics also have sort of a secondary
role<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.130> they<00:02:30.220> tend<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.670> weapons

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
role in that they tend to have weapons

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.990 
role in that they tend to have weapons
and<00:02:31.540> items<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.470> help<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.250> team<00:02:33.430> out<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:33.760> some

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and items that help the team out in some

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.720 
and items that help the team out in some
way<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.480> know<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.810> Val<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.590> example<00:02:36.040> she<00:02:36.490> has

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
way you know so Val for example she has

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.120 
way you know so Val for example she has
a<00:02:36.760> tranquilizer<00:02:37.660> dart<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.560> know<00:02:38.680> which<00:02:38.860> slows

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
a tranquilizer dart you know which slows

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.460 
a tranquilizer dart you know which slows
the<00:02:39.340> monster<00:02:39.700> down<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.390> third<00:02:40.690> would<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:40.960> a

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the monster down the third would be a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.070 
the monster down the third would be a
trapper<00:02:41.770> class<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.430> trapper<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.600> all<00:02:43.780> about

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
trapper class and trapper is all about

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.680 
trapper class and trapper is all about
location<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.150> controlling<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.270> monsters

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
location and controlling the monsters

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.450 
location and controlling the monsters
movement<00:02:47.170> right<00:02:47.380> everyone<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:48.040> follow<00:02:48.250> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
movement right everyone can follow the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.400 
movement right everyone can follow the
monsters<00:02:48.790> footprints<00:02:49.210> but<00:02:49.840> he's<00:02:49.990> got<00:02:50.170> tools

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
monsters footprints but he's got tools

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.380 
monsters footprints but he's got tools
that<00:02:50.680> said<00:02:50.890> go<00:02:51.160> beyond<00:02:51.520> that<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.240> of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
that said go beyond that and then of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.570 
that said go beyond that and then of
course<00:02:52.420> we've<00:02:52.990> got<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.410> sport<00:02:53.860> class<00:02:54.070> support

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
course we've got the sport class support

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.450 
course we've got the sport class support
classes<00:02:54.910> probably<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.660> would<00:02:56.200> say<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:57.220> more

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
classes probably I would say the more

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.150 
classes probably I would say the more
advanced<00:02:58.150> class<00:02:58.510> because<00:02:58.960> his<00:02:59.380> role<00:02:59.710> is<00:02:59.890> not

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
advanced class because his role is not

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.730 
advanced class because his role is not
as<00:03:00.400> clearly<00:03:00.700> defined<00:03:01.180> he<00:03:01.540> provides<00:03:01.930> tactical

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
as clearly defined he provides tactical

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.290 
as clearly defined he provides tactical
advantages<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> rest<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.090> team

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
advantages to the rest of the team

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.140 
advantages to the rest of the team
there's<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.080> nice<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:06.070> bit<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.430> daisy<00:03:06.760> chain

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
there's a nice little bit of daisy chain

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.700 
there's a nice little bit of daisy chain
you<00:03:07.510> know<00:03:07.600> action<00:03:07.990> that<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.200> can<00:03:08.350> kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.560> get

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
you know action that you can kind of get

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.530 
you know action that you can kind of get
going<00:03:09.010> whenever<00:03:09.280> everyone<00:03:09.670> sort<00:03:10.210> of<00:03:10.300> doing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
going whenever everyone sort of doing

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.720 
going whenever everyone sort of doing
their<00:03:10.690> job<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.500> know<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.710> monster<00:03:12.070> sees<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
their job you know the monster sees the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.670 
their job you know the monster sees the
medic<00:03:13.030> healing<00:03:13.780> people<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.170> goes<00:03:14.290> after<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
medic healing people and goes after the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.350 
medic healing people and goes after the
medic<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.100> then<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.340> course<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.820> support<00:03:16.209> guy

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
medic and then of course the support guy

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.940 
medic and then of course the support guy
shields<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.020> medic<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.410> then<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.800> monster

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
shields the medic so then the monster

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.040 
shields the medic so then the monster
comes<00:03:18.280> after<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.820> support<00:03:19.360> guy<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:19.750> this

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
comes after the support guy all this

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.930 
comes after the support guy all this
time<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.590> assault<00:03:20.860> guy<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.130> shooting<00:03:21.640> and

time the assault guy is shooting and
doing<00:03:22.150> damage<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.810> then<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.380> course<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:24.640> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
doing damage and then of course just to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.580 
doing damage and then of course just to
make<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.240> super<00:03:25.720> annoying<00:03:26.050> for<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.380> monster

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
make it super annoying for the monster

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
into his back to keep him from going

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.460 
into his back to keep him from going
anywhere

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.920 

that's<00:03:37.160> part<00:03:37.460> of<00:03:37.520> what<00:03:37.970> we<00:03:38.090> wanted<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.420> do<00:03:38.630> like

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that's part of what we wanted to do like

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.600 
that's part of what we wanted to do like
taking<00:03:39.410> what<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:39.650> learned<00:03:39.860> from<00:03:39.950> left<00:03:40.460> 4<00:03:40.580> dead

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
taking what we learned from left 4 dead

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.970 
taking what we learned from left 4 dead
about<00:03:40.940> cooperative<00:03:41.870> play<00:03:41.990> right<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.560> sort<00:03:42.920> of

about cooperative play right and sort of

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.280 
about cooperative play right and sort of
pushing<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.460> so<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.970> goal<00:03:44.150> ultimately<00:03:44.720> is

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
pushing it so the goal ultimately is

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.770 
pushing it so the goal ultimately is
easy<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.130> learn<00:03:46.280> difficult<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.030> master<00:03:47.450> we

easy to learn difficult to master we

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.510 
easy to learn difficult to master we
want<00:03:48.020> everyone<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> sort<00:03:48.980> of<00:03:49.040> be<00:03:49.130> able<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.400> come
