there the results of the spiciest are

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
there the results of the spiciest are
not<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:54.110> important<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:56.070> me<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
not really so important to me as a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
not really so important to me as a
player<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.420> six<00:00:57.719> cents<00:00:58.050> comes<00:00:58.260> out

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
player just because six cents comes out

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
player just because six cents comes out
in<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.649> week<00:01:00.920> yeah<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.690> six

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in a week yeah that's a thing so six

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.299 
in a week yeah that's a thing so six
tenths<00:01:04.140> comes<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> week<00:01:04.650> dragons<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:05.250> a

lot better I assume light shines get a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
lot better I assume light shines get a
little<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.710> better<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
little bit better but the thing is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980
