00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
was that everyone would get really sick

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.500 
was that everyone would get really sick
of<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> or<00:00:44.280> everyone<00:00:44.700> was<00:00:45.530> yeah<00:00:46.610> too<00:00:47.610> scared<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of it or everyone was yeah too scared to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
of it or everyone was yeah too scared to
try<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.840> again<00:00:49.610> every<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.000> has<00:00:51.120> such<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
try it again every because it has such a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.529 
try it again every because it has such a
reputation<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.960> being<00:00:52.020> awful<00:00:52.789> that<00:00:53.789> tonight
