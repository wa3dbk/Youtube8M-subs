00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.889
 gave glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.379
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.690
 Hello everyone, Kate, and today I want 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.240
 tell about the game mutant roadkill from 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.490
 developer glue mobile after installation 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.439
 games we will see something else like racing 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.870
 Rainer Well, if I may say so 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.090
 driver will not argue the gameplay 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.000
 here is monotonous like all radar 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.890
 moving forward knocking down the monster and getting 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.699
 coins for murder trying not to crash 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.829
 into obstacles 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.110
 here we are just moving 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.850
 real car and want to say 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.859
 the feeling of the game at first just 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.239
 breathtaking 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.190
 clumsy monsters fun hiding under 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.620
 wheels and obstacles at the beginning of the game 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.960
 pretty easy to go around however this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.710
 only first passing the second menu 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 your way 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.659
 companions will slow us down 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.739
 wanting fun ride with us is clear 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.389
 the case was refused 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.760
 they will not cling to 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:02.649
 board our meeting machine or at first 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.420
 pores are not a particular threat 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.580
 and just clinging overboard will 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.370
 rock our correspondent interfering with management and 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.140
 here is driving a little more we will face 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.969
 already more serious opponents 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.829
 who and knock on the hood in 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.960
 able to and just explode from 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.969
 clashes don't mind fighting them 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.250
 special bonuses will help us 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.439
 which we will receive when filling 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.890
 the scales on the left well and just pick up by 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.649
 the road 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.579
 general will not be bored as well as 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.590
 the game has a shop 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.689
 To get new punish us too 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.549
 will allow the truth of the price there is not much 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.829
 brutally and to save up some money 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.439
 will have to spend more than one hour per game 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.090
 but as wise people say free 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.490
 cheese is only in a mousetrap 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.500
 so either have patience either 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.539
 get ready to pay developers for 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.579
 new car by the way picture how are you 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.890
 see here expressed in a mix of graphics 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.109
 on the engine and cell technology elements 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.979
 shading from which is achieved special 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.380
 cartoon style 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.270
 perhaps it will seem superfluous to someone but 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 As for me, the game from such a move looks like 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 stylish and unusual and I have it all 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.289
