they<00:00:47.040> feel<00:00:47.220> lucky<00:00:47.580> all<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> stupid<00:00:48.750> stuff

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
they feel lucky all that stupid stuff

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.940 
they feel lucky all that stupid stuff
anyway<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.580> was<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> big<00:00:50.910> disappointment

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
anyway it was a big disappointment

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.300 
anyway it was a big disappointment
it's<00:00:52.950> it's<00:00:53.340> too<00:00:53.580> heavy<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> recoil<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
it's it's too heavy and the recoil is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.840 
it's it's too heavy and the recoil is
insane<00:00:57.060> so<00:00:57.450> you<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.810> one<00:00:57.990> shot<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.920> you've

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
insane so you take one shot and you've

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.550 
insane so you take one shot and you've
got<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.150> hidden<00:01:00.450> quite<00:01:00.840> good<00:01:01.080> on<00:01:01.200> that<00:01:01.230> first

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
got it hidden quite good on that first

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.960 
got it hidden quite good on that first
shot<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:01.950> if<00:01:02.220> you've<00:01:02.370> alerted<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
shot because if you've alerted them to

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.750 
shot because if you've alerted them to
your<00:01:03.210> presence<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:05.309> didn't<00:01:05.550> kill<00:01:05.640> him

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
your presence and you didn't kill him

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
your presence and you didn't kill him
with<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.150> shot<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:07.200> they're<00:01:07.410> faster

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
with the first shot then they're faster

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.790 
with the first shot then they're faster

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
hard to you simply cannot use the scope

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.430 
hard to you simply cannot use the scope
up<00:01:14.640> close<00:01:14.940> like<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.050> obvious<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
up close like you know that's obvious to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040 
up close like you know that's obvious to
say<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.740> fact<00:01:17.130> I've<00:01:17.940> used<00:01:18.240> four<00:01:18.479> times<00:01:18.510> scope

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
say in fact I've used four times scope

say in fact I've used four times scope
with<00:01:19.320> sniper<00:01:19.830> rifles<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.369> close<00:01:20.640> before<00:01:20.930> it's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
with sniper rifles are close before it's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.840 
with sniper rifles are close before it's
um<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.280> difficult<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.670> sky

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
um but that's really difficult with sky

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
um but that's really difficult with sky
because<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.479> far<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.900> flies<00:01:25.050> off

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because you can see how far it flies off

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.460 
because you can see how far it flies off
the<00:01:25.590> recoil<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.369> incredible<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> might

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the recoil is just incredible you might

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.060 
the recoil is just incredible you might
also<00:01:28.619> notice<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.270> I'm<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.470> best<00:01:31.500> team

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070

also obviously don't know this map I'm
walking<00:01:45.090> around<00:01:45.210> trying<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> figure<00:01:46.049> out

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
walking around trying to figure out

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.230 
walking around trying to figure out
where'd<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.399> through<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.700> maze<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
where'd it go through this maze of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
where'd it go through this maze of
crates<00:01:48.619> normally<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.740> barrel<00:01:50.190> through

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
crates normally I just barrel through

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.090 
crates normally I just barrel through
them<00:01:50.580> on<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.000> capture<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> flag<00:01:52.100> up

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

them on my way to capture a flag up
close<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.789> see<00:01:54.000> no<00:01:54.270> scraping<00:01:55.130> it's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
close as you can see no scraping it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.950 
close as you can see no scraping it's
quite<00:01:56.369> powerful<00:01:56.580> that's<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> upside<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
know if you haven't done this trial just

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.180 
know if you haven't done this trial just
run<00:03:09.840> around<00:03:09.960> only<00:03:10.320> there<00:03:10.530> with<00:03:10.650> your<00:03:10.770> sidearm

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
run around only there with your sidearm

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.430 
run around only there with your sidearm
and<00:03:11.430> see<00:03:11.550> how<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.900> think<00:03:12.930> that'll<00:03:13.290> do

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
and see how you go so I think that'll do

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.530 
and see how you go so I think that'll do
I<00:03:13.650> think<00:03:14.010> you've<00:03:14.250> had<00:03:14.370> enough<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.970> watching<00:03:15.270> me

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
I think you've had enough of watching me

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.600 
I think you've had enough of watching me
run<00:03:15.690> around<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:15.990> shot<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.350> back<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:17.490> if

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
run around get shot in the back but if

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.520 
run around get shot in the back but if
you<00:03:17.640> were<00:03:17.820> looking<00:03:17.970> forward<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.390> using<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.870> 44

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
you were looking forward to using the 44

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.010 
you were looking forward to using the 44
Magnum<00:03:19.560> scopes<00:03:20.400> when<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:20.850> around<00:03:21.060> 44<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
Magnum scopes when you get around 44 and

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.350 
Magnum scopes when you get around 44 and
then<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.980> what<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.190> looks<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:24.240> I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
then this is what it looks like and I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.540 
then this is what it looks like and I
hope<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.660> been<00:03:24.720> useful<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.860> least<00:03:26.040> one

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
hope it's been useful for at least one

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.280 
hope it's been useful for at least one
person<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> femoral<00:03:28.080> signing<00:03:28.920> off

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
