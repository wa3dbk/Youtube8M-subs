but<00:01:18.490> yeah<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:19.610> really<00:01:19.760> not<00:01:20.000> hard<00:01:20.180> once<00:01:20.480> you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
but yeah it's really not hard once you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.950 
but yeah it's really not hard once you
learn<00:01:20.780> how<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:20.990> do<00:01:21.260> it<00:01:21.760> but<00:01:22.760> um<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.270> see<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.660> lot<00:01:23.840> of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
learn how to do it but um I see a lot of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.790 
learn how to do it but um I see a lot of
people<00:01:24.290> on<00:01:24.380> YouTube<00:01:24.410> they<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.550> uh<00:01:26.800> hook

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
people on YouTube they like to uh hook

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.890 
people on YouTube they like to uh hook
their<00:01:28.040> leg<00:01:28.250> on<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> horseback<00:01:29.210> they<00:01:29.690> cook

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
their leg on to the horseback they cook

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.180 
their leg on to the horseback they cook
their<00:01:30.050> foot<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.530> over<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.800> horse's

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
their foot right over the horse's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.420 
their foot right over the horse's
backbone<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.030> then<00:01:33.020> they<00:01:33.230> scooch<00:01:33.830> themselves

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
backbone and then they scooch themselves

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.420 
backbone and then they scooch themselves
up<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:35.350> hey<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.380> guess<00:01:36.650> how<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:36.860> works<00:01:37.040> too<00:01:37.400> but

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
up and hey I guess how it works too but

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.630 
up and hey I guess how it works too but
this<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.450> lot<00:01:38.780> easier<00:01:39.080> it's<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.920> lot<00:01:40.430> less

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
this is a lot easier it's a lot less

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.100 
this is a lot easier it's a lot less
effort<00:01:40.850> once<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.330> learn<00:01:41.480> how<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.660> do<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.930> but

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
effort once you learn how to do it but

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.280 
effort once you learn how to do it but
to<00:01:42.650> start<00:01:43.010> it's<00:01:43.490> probably<00:01:43.910> better<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.420> like

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
to start it's probably better to like

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.590 
to start it's probably better to like
hook<00:01:45.890> your<00:01:46.100> leg<00:01:46.250> over<00:01:46.460> their<00:01:46.700> back<00:01:46.880> I'm<00:01:47.270> not

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
hook your leg over their back I'm not

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.450 
hook your leg over their back I'm not
going<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:47.840> do<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.050> because<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.530> looks<00:01:49.070> kind<00:01:49.340> of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
going to do it because it looks kind of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.650 
going to do it because it looks kind of
painful<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.660> horse<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:52.330> yeah<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.540> could

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
painful to the horse but yeah you could

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.810 
painful to the horse but yeah you could
start<00:01:53.900> by<00:01:53.960> hooking<00:01:54.260> your<00:01:54.470> leg<00:01:54.650> over<00:01:55.280> their

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
start by hooking your leg over their

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.000 
start by hooking your leg over their
back<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.180> eventually<00:01:56.380> you'll<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.440> learn<00:01:57.800> to

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
back and eventually you'll just learn to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.700 
back and eventually you'll just learn to
use<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.580> momentum<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.240> your<00:01:59.270> leg<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.229> swim<00:02:00.530> all

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
use the momentum of your leg to swim all

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.180 
use the momentum of your leg to swim all
the<00:02:00.770> way<00:02:00.950> up<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.340> over<00:02:01.640> onto<00:02:02.479> their<00:02:02.750> back<00:02:03.190> yeah

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
the way up and over onto their back yeah

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.680 
the way up and over onto their back yeah
she's<00:02:04.460> being<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.790> really<00:02:05.030> good<00:02:05.210> model<00:02:05.420> right

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
she's being a really good model right

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.210 
she's being a really good model right
now<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> haven't<00:02:06.110> had<00:02:06.260> rain<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.710> very<00:02:06.890> many<00:02:07.100> of
