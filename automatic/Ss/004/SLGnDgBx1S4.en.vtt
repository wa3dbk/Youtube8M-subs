footage<00:00:59.710> if<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:00.860> see<00:01:01.070> something<00:01:01.309> that's<00:01:01.580> a

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
footage if I see something that's a

footage if I see something that's a
blatant<00:01:02.089> fake<00:01:02.330> I<00:01:02.510> may<00:01:02.689> chime<00:01:03.019> in<00:01:03.260> but<00:01:03.710> for<00:01:03.920> the

next crater and you know footage like

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.450 
next crater and you know footage like
this<00:01:37.460> if<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.450> was<00:01:38.510> crisp<00:01:39.440> clear<00:01:39.830> high-def

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
this if this was crisp clear high-def

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.620 
this if this was crisp clear high-def
footage<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.600> would<00:01:41.750> be<00:01:41.870> something<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.380> see

unfortunately<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.810> quality<00:01:44.990> makes<00:01:45.620> it<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.890> bit

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
unfortunately the quality makes it a bit

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.450 
unfortunately the quality makes it a bit
tough<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:48.560> go<00:01:48.710> much<00:01:48.920> further<00:01:49.130> than<00:01:49.310> that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460

learned on how to get your quality up
and<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.650> lot<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.979> eyepieces<00:01:58.400> these<00:01:58.790> days

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
and a lot of the eyepieces these days

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.450 
and a lot of the eyepieces these days
are<00:01:59.420> actually<00:01:59.750> optical<00:02:00.500> plastic<00:02:00.979> from<00:02:01.159> China

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
are actually optical plastic from China

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.760 
are actually optical plastic from China
they're<00:02:01.729> junk<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.260> be<00:02:03.380> careful

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
they're junk so you have to be careful

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.890 
they're junk so you have to be careful
with<00:02:03.860> your<00:02:03.979> eyepieces<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:05.090> at<00:02:05.210> any<00:02:05.390> rate<00:02:05.479> his

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
with your eyepieces but at any rate his

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.020 
with your eyepieces but at any rate his
footage<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.500> getting<00:02:07.159> better<00:02:07.369> I've<00:02:07.580> seen<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
footage is getting better I've seen it

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.690 
footage is getting better I've seen it
but<00:02:08.810> this<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> crazy<00:02:09.440> thing<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.280> it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
but this is a crazy thing you know it

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.640 
but this is a crazy thing you know it
looks<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.180> it's<00:02:11.390> almost<00:02:11.750> right<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:12.500> at

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
looks like it's almost right there at

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.570 
looks like it's almost right there at
the<00:02:12.769> moon<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:14.480> honest<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:16.280> think

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the moon and to be honest I don't think

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.430 
the moon and to be honest I don't think
that<00:02:16.849> that's<00:02:17.000> really<00:02:17.330> possible<00:02:17.690> with

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that that's really possible with

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.470 
that that's really possible with
everything<00:02:19.249> that<00:02:19.340> I've<00:02:19.519> come<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.090> think<00:02:20.359> is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
everything that I've come to think is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.929 
everything that I've come to think is
probably<00:02:20.749> true<00:02:21.319> nonetheless<00:02:22.099> here's<00:02:22.700> this

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
probably true nonetheless here's this

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.520 
probably true nonetheless here's this
footage<00:02:23.329> so<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.629> mean

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
footage so I mean

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100 
footage so I mean
everything<00:02:25.490> we<00:02:25.640> get<00:02:25.850> on<00:02:25.970> film<00:02:26.240> helps<00:02:26.780> us<00:02:26.930> learn

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
everything we get on film helps us learn

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.190 
everything we get on film helps us learn
something<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.480> thank<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.600> Randy<00:02:29.900> that's<00:02:30.020> a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
something and thank you Randy that's a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.530 
something and thank you Randy that's a
heck<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.620> catch<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.220> man<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.180> too<00:02:32.390> bad

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
heck of a catch and man it's too bad

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.160 
heck of a catch and man it's too bad
that<00:02:32.810> wasn't<00:02:33.020> sharp<00:02:33.590> HD<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:35.050> it'd<00:02:36.050> be

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that wasn't sharp HD because it'd be

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.010 
that wasn't sharp HD because it'd be
something<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.560> see<00:02:37.240> anyhow<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.510> went<00:02:38.690> out<00:02:38.840> last

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
something to see anyhow I went out last

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.140 
something to see anyhow I went out last
night<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.710> shot<00:02:39.980> Jupiter<00:02:40.490> as<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.730> remember

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
night and I shot Jupiter as you remember

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.570 
night and I shot Jupiter as you remember
I've<00:02:41.750> been<00:02:42.020> witnessing<00:02:42.290> Jupiter<00:02:43.190> turning

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
I've been witnessing Jupiter turning

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
I've been witnessing Jupiter turning
blue<00:02:43.959> happened<00:02:44.959> back<00:02:45.830> in<00:02:46.070> 2013<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.880> believe<00:02:47.030> and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
blue happened back in 2013 I believe and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.449 
blue happened back in 2013 I believe and
then<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.780> posted<00:02:47.959> footage<00:02:48.380> recently<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:49.430> I

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
then I posted footage recently so what I

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.230 
then I posted footage recently so what I
did<00:02:49.580> last<00:02:49.910> night

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
did last night

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.630 
did last night
is<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.660> did<00:02:50.810> some<00:02:50.990> experiments<00:02:51.490> what<00:02:52.490> you're

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
is I did some experiments what you're

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.540 
is I did some experiments what you're
looking<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.030> here<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.740> what<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.370> do

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
looking at here is what you have to do

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.100 
looking at here is what you have to do
when<00:02:55.790> you're<00:02:55.880> taking<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.390> still<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> get<00:02:56.959> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
when you're taking is still to get the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.870 
when you're taking is still to get the
moon's<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.560> overexposed<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.459> planet

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
moon's is overexposed the planet

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.710 
moon's is overexposed the planet
otherwise<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.550> moons<00:03:01.550> get<00:03:01.880> lost<00:03:02.180> because

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
otherwise the moons get lost because

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.390 
otherwise the moons get lost because
they're<00:03:03.050> not<00:03:03.170> bright<00:03:03.500> enough<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.950> keep<00:03:04.100> pace

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
they're not bright enough to keep pace

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.830 
they're not bright enough to keep pace
with<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.870> perfectly<00:03:05.870> focused<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.720> know

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
with a perfectly focused and you know

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.380 
with a perfectly focused and you know
when<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.200> adjust<00:03:09.830> your<00:03:10.070> f-stop<00:03:10.220> when<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.270> get

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
when you adjust your f-stop when you get

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.240 
when you adjust your f-stop when you get
the<00:03:11.540> planetary<00:03:12.140> disc<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:13.010> moons

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
the planetary disc and the moons

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.040 
the planetary disc and the moons
disappear<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.540> that's<00:03:15.140> what<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:17.050> now

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
disappear so that's what this is now

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.020 
disappear so that's what this is now
what<00:03:18.230> I'm<00:03:18.320> gonna<00:03:18.410> do<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.100> show<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.640> still

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
what I'm gonna do is just show a still

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.940 
what I'm gonna do is just show a still
or<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:20.390> here<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.810> scene<00:03:21.050> was<00:03:21.320> horrible<00:03:21.739> last

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
or two here the scene was horrible last

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.560 
or two here the scene was horrible last
night<00:03:22.130> we're<00:03:22.310> having<00:03:22.610> kind<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:23.000> Santa<00:03:23.360> Anna

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
night we're having kind of a Santa Anna

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.470 
night we're having kind of a Santa Anna
here<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.800> wind<00:03:25.040> was<00:03:25.220> kicking<00:03:25.610> up<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.000> air<00:03:26.150> has

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
here the wind was kicking up the air has

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.199 
here the wind was kicking up the air has
been<00:03:26.510> very<00:03:27.080> warm<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.730> interesting<00:03:28.970> to

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
been very warm but it's interesting to

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.220 
been very warm but it's interesting to
see<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.540> moons<00:03:30.110> in<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:30.890> way<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:33.019> is

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
see the moons in this way so here is

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.520 
see the moons in this way so here is
Jupiter<00:03:34.030> through<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.060> 12<00:03:35.720> millimeter<00:03:36.290> eyepiece

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
Jupiter through a 12 millimeter eyepiece

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.650 
Jupiter through a 12 millimeter eyepiece
using<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.370> projection<00:03:37.820> method<00:03:38.390> where<00:03:38.630> you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
using a projection method where you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.780 
using a projection method where you
project<00:03:39.110> out<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:39.950> eyepiece<00:03:40.340> into<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
project out of the eyepiece into the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.320 
project out of the eyepiece into the
camera<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:43.040> seeing<00:03:43.280> was<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:43.730> bad<00:03:43.970> that

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
camera and the seeing was so bad that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.420 
camera and the seeing was so bad that
you're<00:03:45.110> not<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.530> get<00:03:45.739> too<00:03:46.070> much<00:03:46.220> better

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
you're not going to get too much better

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.800 
you're not going to get too much better
than<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.820> on<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> night<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.390> this

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
than this on a night like this

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.530 
than this on a night like this
now<00:03:48.350> here's<00:03:48.530> video<00:03:48.920> run<00:03:49.459> with<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> 26

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
now here's video run with a 26

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.990 
now here's video run with a 26
millimeter<00:03:51.080> eyepiece<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.430> ran<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.820> for<00:03:52.970> a

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
millimeter eyepiece and I ran it for a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.120 
millimeter eyepiece and I ran it for a
long<00:03:53.209> time<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.170> saw<00:03:54.440> no<00:03:54.739> color<00:03:55.040> change

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
long time and I saw no color change

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.240 
long time and I saw no color change
although<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.959> will<00:03:57.200> notice<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.950> stills

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
although you will notice in the stills

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.810 
although you will notice in the stills
and<00:03:58.459> in<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:58.730> video<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.989> upper<00:04:00.470> limb<00:04:00.820> maybe

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
and in this video the upper limb maybe

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.880 
and in this video the upper limb maybe
from<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.269> 9<00:04:02.540> o'clock<00:04:02.690> all<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.380> way<00:04:03.470> over<00:04:03.769> to

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
from the 9 o'clock all the way over to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.370 
from the 9 o'clock all the way over to
the<00:04:03.980> 3<00:04:04.250> o'clock<00:04:04.610> position<00:04:04.780> there<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.989> very

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
the 3 o'clock position there is a very

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.280 
the 3 o'clock position there is a very
slight<00:04:06.769> blue<00:04:07.190> tinge<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:08.060> every<00:04:08.900> image<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.260> took

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
slight blue tinge on every image I took

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.130 
slight blue tinge on every image I took
last<00:04:09.709> night<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:11.090> may<00:04:11.329> be<00:04:11.390> tough<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:11.989> to

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
last night it may be tough for you to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.780 
last night it may be tough for you to
see<00:04:12.290> once<00:04:12.620> this<00:04:12.799> is<00:04:12.950> encoded<00:04:13.400> because<00:04:13.610> it's

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
see once this is encoded because it's

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.789 
see once this is encoded because it's
tough<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> see<00:04:14.329> in<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.570> raw<00:04:14.690> video<00:04:14.930> in<00:04:15.380> some<00:04:15.650> of

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
tough to see in the raw video in some of
