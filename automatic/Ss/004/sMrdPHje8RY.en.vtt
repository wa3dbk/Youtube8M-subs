00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
don't even want to run the risk of

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.190 
don't even want to run the risk of
putting<00:00:31.130> them<00:00:31.369> in<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.670> in<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.150> vacuum

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
putting them in the in the vacuum

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.860 
putting them in the in the vacuum
to<00:00:34.010> their<00:00:34.489> fours<00:00:34.790> in<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> vacuum<00:00:35.390> packed

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
to their fours in the vacuum packed

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.170 
to their fours in the vacuum packed
machine<00:00:36.260> because<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:37.070> don't<00:00:37.580> want<00:00:37.640> them<00:00:37.910> I

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
machine because I don't want them I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.330 
machine because I don't want them I
don't<00:00:38.809> want<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.020> thing<00:00:39.320> squishing<00:00:39.949> juice

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
don't want that thing squishing juice

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.500 
don't want that thing squishing juice
out<00:00:40.699> of<00:00:41.270> them<00:00:41.540> before<00:00:42.410> they<00:00:42.559> get<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.949> grill

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
out of them before they get to the grill

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.610 
out of them before they get to the grill
so<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:44.570> think<00:00:44.629> we're<00:00:44.930> just<00:00:45.080> going<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.290> stack

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
so I think we're just going to stack

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.000 
so I think we're just going to stack
them<00:00:45.830> may<00:00:46.010> be<00:00:46.040> too<00:00:47.030> high<00:00:47.300> at<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.750> most<00:00:48.010> like

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
them may be too high at the most like

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.619 
them may be too high at the most like
this<00:00:49.360> cover<00:00:50.360> them<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:50.769> some<00:00:51.769> saran<00:00:52.160> wrap<00:00:52.629> so

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
this cover them with some saran wrap so

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.890 
this cover them with some saran wrap so
they<00:00:54.220> keep<00:00:55.220> their<00:00:55.430> blue<00:00:55.699> they're<00:00:56.269> nice<00:00:56.479> red

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
they keep their blue they're nice red

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.920 
they keep their blue they're nice red
