00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.270 
if like us your mirror is really old
it's<00:00:50.230> worth<00:00:50.469> just<00:00:50.500> giving<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> quick<00:00:51.219> paint

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
it's worth just giving it a quick paint

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.310 
it's worth just giving it a quick paint
sand<00:00:54.280> down<00:00:54.519> the<00:00:54.579> mirror<00:00:54.909> as<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.600> enables<00:00:56.109> the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
sand down the mirror as this enables the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
sand down the mirror as this enables the
paint<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:56.800> stick<00:00:56.829> better<00:00:57.449> wipe<00:00:58.449> away<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.929> dust

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
paint to stick better wipe away the dust

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.439 
paint to stick better wipe away the dust
do<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.750> reaction<00:01:01.929> right<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.890> is<00:01:03.010> time<00:01:03.449> to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
do the reaction right so it is time to

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.010 
do the reaction right so it is time to
paint<00:01:05.369> we've<00:01:06.369> definitely<00:01:06.610> with<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.180> paint

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.880 

Lego<00:01:11.020> time<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:13.509> run<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:13.960> lid<00:01:14.289> bit<00:01:14.770> of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
Lego time so I just run the lid bit of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.820 
Lego time so I just run the lid bit of
glue<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.430> hot<00:01:15.610> glue<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.210> then<00:01:17.200> I'm<00:01:17.500> going<00:01:17.680> to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
glue the hot glue and then I'm going to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.540 
glue the hot glue and then I'm going to
stick<00:01:18.159> it<00:01:18.189> on<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.899> side<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.280> first

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
stick it on the side that's the first

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.830 
stick it on the side that's the first
one<00:01:21.789> done<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.670> can<00:01:24.789> put<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.030> leg<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.330> all<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
one done you can put the leg up all the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.109 
one done you can put the leg up all the
way<00:01:25.990> up<00:01:26.200> running<00:01:26.710> along<00:01:26.979> but<00:01:27.310> actually<00:01:27.819> we're

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
way up running along but actually we're

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.760 
way up running along but actually we're
not<00:01:28.240> going<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.479> stick<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.080> pieces<00:01:29.319> all<00:01:29.740> around

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
not going to stick the pieces all around

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.100 
not going to stick the pieces all around
so<00:01:30.520> we're<00:01:30.819> going<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.000> save<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> bit<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.720> Lego

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
so we're going to save on a bit of Lego

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.699 
so we're going to save on a bit of Lego
