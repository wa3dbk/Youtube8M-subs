00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.760 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:40.040> fact<00:04:40.580> iphone<00:04:41.180> 4<00:04:41.479> delivers<00:04:41.960> up<00:04:42.139> to<00:04:42.200> forty

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.719 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty
percent<00:04:43.100> more<00:04:43.370> talk<00:04:43.580> time<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:46.130> started

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
percent more talk time and we started

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.020 
percent more talk time and we started
with<00:04:47.229> completely<00:04:48.229> opposing<00:04:48.650> goals<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.370> we

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
with completely opposing goals and we

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.360 
with completely opposing goals and we
wanted<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.360> make<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:50.690> iphone<00:04:51.200> more<00:04:51.830> capable

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
wanted to make this iphone more capable

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.240 
wanted to make this iphone more capable
we<00:04:52.639> wanted<00:04:52.940> to<00:04:52.970> add<00:04:53.180> more<00:04:53.450> feature<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.440> yet<00:04:55.130> at

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.830 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at
the<00:04:55.310> same<00:04:55.370> time<00:04:55.580> we<00:04:56.270> wanted<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.570> make<00:04:56.690> it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
the same time we wanted to make it

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.409 
the same time we wanted to make it
smaller<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.410> even<00:04:57.770> thinner<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:59.210> lets

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
smaller and even thinner and that lets

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.219 
smaller and even thinner and that lets
us<00:04:59.539> some<00:04:59.750> really<00:05:00.169> surprising<00:05:00.350> innovation<00:05:02.229> we

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
us some really surprising innovation we

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.990 
us some really surprising innovation we
developed<00:05:03.680> an<00:05:03.770> entirely<00:05:04.310> new<00:05:04.490> grade

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
developed an entirely new grade

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.080 
developed an entirely new grade
stainless<00:05:05.660> steel<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.680> after<00:05:07.010> machining<00:05:07.430> is

stainless steel that after machining is

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.230 
stainless steel that after machining is
incredibly<00:05:09.020> strong<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:10.250> also<00:05:10.460> remarkably

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240

giving<00:05:17.840> us<00:05:18.050> more<00:05:18.260> internal<00:05:18.800> volume<00:05:20.500> we<00:05:21.500> also

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
giving us more internal volume we also

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.560 
giving us more internal volume we also
developed<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.340> custom<00:05:22.729> glass<00:05:22.910> that's
