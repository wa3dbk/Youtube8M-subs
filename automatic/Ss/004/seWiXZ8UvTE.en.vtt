I'm<00:00:06.930> blade<00:00:07.170> balancing<00:00:08.269> I've<00:00:09.269> been<00:00:09.420> looking<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
I'm blade balancing I've been looking a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.740 
I'm blade balancing I've been looking a
lot<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.320> tutorials<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:11.040> YouTube<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.849> stuff

like<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.259> blade<00:00:13.469> balancing<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:15.049> lot

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
like that with blade balancing and a lot

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.340 
like that with blade balancing and a lot
of<00:00:16.160> what<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.369> guys<00:00:18.300> seem<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.869> doing<00:00:19.050> is

of what the guys seem to be doing is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.920 
of what the guys seem to be doing is
they<00:00:19.560> seem<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.039> getting<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:21.570> know<00:00:21.720> some

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
they seem to be getting a you know some

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.460 
they seem to be getting a you know some
kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> line<00:00:22.500> connector<00:00:23.130> deal<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
kind of a line connector deal and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.580 
kind of a line connector deal and
connecting<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.910> blades<00:00:26.910> ups<00:00:27.980> like<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
connecting the blades ups like so

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
connecting the blades ups like so
putting<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.009> some<00:00:32.520> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> system<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
putting them on some kind of system to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.990 
putting them on some kind of system to
like<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> heavier<00:00:35.730> blade

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
like see which is the heavier blade

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.139 
like see which is the heavier blade
which<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.450> lighter<00:00:36.840> blade<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.610> they're

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
which is lighter blade and then they're

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.810 
which is lighter blade and then they're
doing<00:00:39.660> their<00:00:39.780> blade<00:00:40.020> tracking<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:40.820> my

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
doing their blade tracking now my

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.209 
doing their blade tracking now my
question<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.690> access<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> really

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
question is I have access to a really

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.889 
question is I have access to a really
precision<00:00:44.730> scale<00:00:45.090> because<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.480> work<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
precision scale because I work in the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.959 
precision scale because I work in the
jewelry<00:00:46.230> industry<00:00:46.309> I'm<00:00:47.309> wondering<00:00:47.579> if<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
jewelry industry I'm wondering if it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.830 
jewelry industry I'm wondering if it
would<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.210> better<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.700> just<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> weigh<00:00:51.059> one

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
would be better for me just to weigh one

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
would be better for me just to weigh one
on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> scale<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.800> weigh<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> other<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.430> on

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
on the scale and weigh the other one on

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.170 
on the scale and weigh the other one on
the<00:00:53.699> scale<00:00:53.940> individually<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.699> see<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the scale individually and see which is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.979 
the scale individually and see which is
the<00:00:57.360> heavier<00:00:57.629> blade<00:00:57.960> add<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
the heavier blade add a little bit of

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
the heavier blade add a little bit of
tape<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.289> lighter<00:01:01.649> blade<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.370> him<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
tape to the lighter blade to get him to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.700 
tape to the lighter blade to get him to
the<00:01:02.640> same<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> same<00:01:05.700> way<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.710> there

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the same to the same way and then there

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.600 
the same to the same way and then there
was<00:01:07.770> something<00:01:08.100> about<00:01:10.250> balancing<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
was something about balancing it in the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
was something about balancing it in the
center<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> see<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.799> where<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> where

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
center to see you know where the where

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.050 
center to see you know where the where
the<00:01:14.850> blade<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:16.130> was<00:01:17.130> balanced<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.909> then

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the blade was was balanced and then

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
the blade was was balanced and then
making<00:01:18.299> adjustments<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> tape<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.549> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
making adjustments from the tape so if I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
making adjustments from the tape so if I
don't<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.240> use<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> those<00:01:22.820> blade

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
don't have to use one of those blade

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
don't have to use one of those blade
balancing<00:01:24.450> things<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:25.020> mean<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
balancing things I mean I would think it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.490 
balancing things I mean I would think it
may<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.180> easy<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
may be just just as easy if I have a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
may be just just as easy if I have a
really<00:01:29.450> precision<00:01:30.450> scale<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.900> front<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> me

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
really precision scale in front of me

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.510 
really precision scale in front of me
all<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> time<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
all the time I would think it to be the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.749 
all the time I would think it to be the
same<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:32.970> doing<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.930> without<00:01:34.140> having<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
same as doing this without having to you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.149 
same as doing this without having to you
know<00:01:35.790> rig<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.079> balance<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> watch

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
know rig it up and balance it and watch

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.890 
know rig it up and balance it and watch
it<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:38.880> piece<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.390> tape<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it and put a little piece of tape and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.490 
it and put a little piece of tape and
wait<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> move<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.759> down<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> yeah

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
wait for it to move up or down so yeah

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
wait for it to move up or down so yeah
that's<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.220> question<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
that's my question I want to know if I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
that's my question I want to know if I
can<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.720> weigh<00:01:46.439> these<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
can just weigh these out and then if I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.200 
can just weigh these out and then if I
can<00:01:48.360> somehow<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:49.079> find<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.060> find<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
can somehow like find the find the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.200 
can somehow like find the find the
middle<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.990> balance<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> blade<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
middle of the balance on the blade and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.170 
middle of the balance on the blade and
maybe<00:01:54.210> Pullo<00:01:54.600> more<00:01:55.049> tape<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
maybe Pullo more tape here or there to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.859 
maybe Pullo more tape here or there to
kind<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> level<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> yep<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.600> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
kind of level it out so yep that's it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
kind of level it out so yep that's it
that's<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.829> my<00:02:02.100> question<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.000> you
