again here on the other side I just made

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.540 
again here on the other side I just made
a<00:03:57.840> small<00:03:58.260> incision<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.069> get<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.310> started

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
a small incision just to get it started

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.130 
the rest of the attachment that's it
pretty<00:04:11.879> simple

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.540 

just<00:04:19.140> comes<00:04:19.380> apart<00:04:19.530> when<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.070> things<00:04:20.310> been

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.550 
just comes apart when the things been

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.730 
just comes apart when the things been
cooked<00:04:21.020> that's<00:04:22.020> when<00:04:22.170> you've<00:04:22.290> got<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.500> raw

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
cooked that's when you've got a raw

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.080 
cooked that's when you've got a raw
chicken<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:24.450> doesn't<00:04:24.750> come<00:04:24.870> apart<00:04:24.960> too<00:04:25.380> easy

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
chicken it doesn't come apart too easy

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.720 
chicken it doesn't come apart too easy
but<00:04:27.290> in<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.410> nutshell<00:04:28.620> that's<00:04:29.010> pretty<00:04:29.250> much<00:04:29.430> it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
but in a nutshell that's pretty much it

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.150 
but in a nutshell that's pretty much it
just<00:04:29.970> run<00:04:30.690> your<00:04:30.810> fingers<00:04:31.170> over<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.500> rest<00:04:32.040> of

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
just run your fingers over the rest of

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.830 
just run your fingers over the rest of
the<00:04:32.250> carcass<00:04:32.520> here<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.000> can<00:04:33.180> pull<00:04:33.390> off<00:04:33.540> a

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the carcass here you can pull off a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.930 
the carcass here you can pull off a
little<00:04:34.590> bits<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:34.950> pieces<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.310> meat<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:35.880> you

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
little bits and pieces of meat so you

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.140 
little bits and pieces of meat so you
don't<00:04:36.240> throw<00:04:37.170> anything<00:04:37.470> out<00:04:37.740> or<00:04:37.800> waste<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.460> you

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.570 

can<00:04:42.150> usually<00:04:42.300> get<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> pretty<00:04:43.190> pretty<00:04:44.190> healthy

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
can usually get a pretty pretty healthy

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.750 
can usually get a pretty pretty healthy
stack<00:04:44.880> here<00:04:45.770> not<00:04:46.770> enough<00:04:47.010> to<00:04:47.160> make<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.340> sandwich

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760

I<00:04:56.360> always<00:04:57.360> pulled<00:04:57.719> this<00:04:57.809> out<00:04:58.020> for<00:04:58.229> my<00:04:58.319> little

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
I always pulled this out for my little

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:09.040 
I always pulled this out for my little
ones<00:04:58.710> they<00:04:59.039> love

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.310 

and<00:05:10.050> that's<00:05:10.350> about<00:05:10.530> it<00:05:10.710> guys<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:13.050> you<00:05:13.140> can<00:05:13.170> see

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
and that's about it guys so you can see

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:23.830 
and that's about it guys so you can see
it<00:05:13.590> gets<00:05:13.770> pretty<00:05:14.040> messy<00:05:14.280> no<00:05:15.240> doubt<00:05:15.480> about<00:05:15.630> that

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.260 

I<00:05:23.870> guess<00:05:24.830> we<00:05:24.980> can<00:05:25.130> take<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.520> step<00:05:25.730> further<00:05:26.000> if

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
I guess we can take it a step further if

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.590 
I guess we can take it a step further if
you'd<00:05:26.419> like<00:05:26.600> take<00:05:27.590> one<00:05:27.620> of<00:05:27.889> these<00:05:28.600> chicken

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.250 
you'd like take one of these chicken
legs<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:31.270> show<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.360> how<00:05:32.510> to<00:05:32.570> separate<00:05:33.020> that

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
legs and show you how to separate that

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.990 
legs and show you how to separate that
from<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.620> thigh<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.110> can<00:05:36.260> see<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:37.790> just

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
from the thigh so you can see you just

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.850 
from the thigh so you can see you just
pull<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:38.270> apart<00:05:38.360> right<00:05:38.720> there<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.230> nice<00:05:39.590> little

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
pull it apart right there a nice little

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.340 
pull it apart right there a nice little
slice<00:05:40.250> do<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:41.180> hit<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.450> socket<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.139> if<00:05:42.260> you
