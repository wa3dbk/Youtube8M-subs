one thing to note that's really the
highlight<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:30.090> our<00:01:30.299> system<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> how

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
highlight of our system is how

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
highlight of our system is how
adjustable<00:01:31.619> our<00:01:31.740> system<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.490> comes

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
adjustable our system is when it comes

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.690 
adjustable our system is when it comes
to<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.329> separate<00:01:34.020> brake<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> shift<00:01:34.979> letter

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to a separate brake and shift letter

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.679 
to a separate brake and shift letter
with<00:01:36.420> all<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:37.850> fitting<00:01:38.850> tools<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
with all the new fitting tools and the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
with all the new fitting tools and the
dedication<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.409> shops<00:01:40.650> are<00:01:40.890> putting<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
dedication at shops are putting to the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.420 
dedication at shops are putting to the
fit<00:01:41.790> systems<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> their<00:01:42.869> stores<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:44.280> really

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
fit systems in their stores it's really

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
fit systems in their stores it's really
nice<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.970> something<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.479> either

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
nice to have something that can either

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.530 
nice to have something that can either
adjust<00:01:46.049> either<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> shifter<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.360> brake

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
adjust either the shifter or the brake

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.020 
adjust either the shifter or the brake
lever<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> you're<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.009> limited<00:01:50.280> by<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> shin

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
lever and you're not limited by the shin

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
lever and you're not limited by the shin
this<00:01:51.540> gives<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> infinite<00:01:52.460> adjustability

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this gives you infinite adjustability

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.060 
this gives you infinite adjustability
for<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> riders<00:01:54.240> hand<00:01:54.420> position<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.590> again

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for the riders hand position and again

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.399 
for the riders hand position and again
we<00:01:56.189> mentioned<00:01:56.579> briefly<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.540> outer<00:01:57.719> cage<00:01:58.049> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we mentioned briefly the outer cage on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
we mentioned briefly the outer cage on
the<00:01:58.680> rear<00:01:58.829> derailleur<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.520> now<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> unique

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
the rear derailleur is now the unique

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.719 
the rear derailleur is now the unique
carbon<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.649> still<00:02:01.829> magnesium<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
carbon and it's still magnesium on the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539 
carbon and it's still magnesium on the
back<00:02:02.909> side<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> upgrade

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
back side of this so that's the upgrade

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.850 
back side of this so that's the upgrade
when<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> comes<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> carbon<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.740> other

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
when it comes to the carbon the other

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.910 
when it comes to the carbon the other
thing<00:02:08.129> we've<00:02:08.340> done<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.610> gone<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
thing we've done is gone to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.699 
a really sweet new Zephyr silver finish
that<00:02:20.000> really<00:02:20.300> helps<00:02:20.540> separate<00:02:20.959> us<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.380> really

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
that really helps separate us and really

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.160 
that really helps separate us and really
compliments<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> UD<00:02:22.550> carbon<00:02:22.760> finish<00:02:23.300> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
compliments the UD carbon finish and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.559 
compliments the UD carbon finish and
really<00:02:24.410> helps<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.950> logos<00:02:25.670> stand<00:02:26.030> out<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
really helps the logos stand out on the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.690 
really helps the logos stand out on the
alloy<00:02:26.989> components<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:27.920> does<00:02:28.100> give<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.459> a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
alloy components so it does give you a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.970 
alloy components so it does give you a
nice<00:02:29.150> benefit<00:02:29.690> there<00:02:30.250> when<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.370> comes<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:32.980> hold

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
nice benefit there when it comes to hold

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.199

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
break is one of the newest components in

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.270 
break is one of the newest components in
a<00:02:48.319> line<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.120> basically<00:02:50.330> taken<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:51.410> brake

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
a line we have basically taken a brake

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.430 
a line we have basically taken a brake
caliper<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.480> everyone's<00:02:53.870> familiar<00:02:53.989> with

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
caliper that everyone's familiar with

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.550 
caliper that everyone's familiar with
being<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> red<00:02:55.340> caliper<00:02:55.850> forgings<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.810> we've

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
being the red caliper forgings and we've

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.520 
being the red caliper forgings and we've
done<00:02:57.739> some<00:02:58.069> machining<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:00.080> we've<00:03:00.319> also

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
done some machining to it and we've also

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.090 
done some machining to it and we've also
added<00:03:01.750> pad<00:03:02.750> holders<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.470> are<00:03:03.530> not<00:03:03.769> machined

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
added pad holders that are not machined

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.009 
added pad holders that are not machined
out<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.970> there<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.299> slight<00:03:05.750> weight

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
out so there is a slight weight

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.140 
out so there is a slight weight
difference<00:03:06.440> between<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.860> two<00:03:07.150> components

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
difference between the two components

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.220 
difference between the two components
but<00:03:08.239> you're<00:03:08.390> still<00:03:08.569> getting<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.959> great

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
but you're still getting the great

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.650 
but you're still getting the great
adjustability<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:10.640> every<00:03:10.970> shot<00:03:11.180> mechanic

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
adjustability that every shot mechanic

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.150 
adjustability that every shot mechanic
drinks<00:03:11.989> about<00:03:12.080> when<00:03:12.530> you're<00:03:12.650> setting<00:03:12.950> up<00:03:13.069> a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
drinks about when you're setting up a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.520 
drinks about when you're setting up a
bike<00:03:13.340> which<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.180> basically<00:03:14.570> an<00:03:14.870> external

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
bike which is basically an external

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.800 
bike which is basically an external
center<00:03:15.799> adjust<00:03:16.220> makes<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.940> super<00:03:17.239> easy<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.540> set

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
center adjust makes it super easy to set

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.930 
center adjust makes it super easy to set
up<00:03:17.840> you're<00:03:18.470> also<00:03:18.650> getting<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.340> nice<00:03:19.549> spring

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
up you're also getting a nice spring

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.390 
up you're also getting a nice spring
tension<00:03:20.359> adjust<00:03:20.720> here<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.890> side<00:03:22.100> which

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
tension adjust here on the side which

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.860 
tension adjust here on the side which
really<00:03:22.700> goes<00:03:22.880> hand<00:03:23.150> in<00:03:23.299> hand<00:03:23.359> with<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
really goes hand in hand with the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.080 
really goes hand in hand with the
adjustability<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.890> shift<00:03:25.130> lever<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:26.000> you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
adjustability of the shift lever so you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.630 
adjustability of the shift lever so you
can<00:03:26.269> really<00:03:26.480> fine<00:03:26.900> tune<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.620> system<00:03:27.829> for<00:03:28.609> the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
can really fine tune the system for the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.819 
can really fine tune the system for the
rider<00:03:28.970> for<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.019> length<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.290> their<00:03:30.410> hand<00:03:30.650> and

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
rider for the length of their hand and

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.530 
rider for the length of their hand and
also<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> amount<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.549> pole<00:03:31.790> or<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> return

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
also the amount of pole or the return

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.720 
also the amount of pole or the return
they<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:32.989> have<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.380> their<00:03:33.560> system<00:03:33.980> so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
they like to have on their system so

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.180 
they like to have on their system so
again<00:03:35.000> we<00:03:35.150> have<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.359> fully<00:03:36.190> oversized

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
again we have a fully oversized

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.370 
again we have a fully oversized
skeletonized<00:03:37.940> red<00:03:38.269> forging<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.200> we've

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
skeletonized red forging that we've

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.130 
skeletonized red forging that we've
taken<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.430> forest<00:03:40.700> level<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.269> again<00:03:41.900> it's

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
taken to the forest level and again it's

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.979 
taken to the forest level and again it's
a<00:03:42.350> little<00:03:42.980> bit<00:03:43.100> of<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.220> weight<00:03:43.400> savings<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.750> our

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
a little bit of a weight savings on our

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.710 
a little bit of a weight savings on our
system<00:03:45.410> when<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.040> combine<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.549> UD<00:03:46.880> carbon

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.470 
system when you combine the UD carbon
and<00:03:48.140> also<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.530> new<00:03:48.680> 6000<00:03:49.280> series<00:03:49.480> forgings

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
and also the new 6000 series forgings

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.110 
and also the new 6000 series forgings
that<00:03:50.660> we<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.900> on<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.290> on<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.769> brakes<00:03:52.120> we're

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
that we have on the on the brakes we're

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.740 
that we have on the on the brakes we're
