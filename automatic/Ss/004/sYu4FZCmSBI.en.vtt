00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so that's obviously trying to rival with

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.510 
so that's obviously trying to rival with
google<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.510> those<00:01:12.659> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> companies<00:01:13.530> HTC

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520

those<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> things<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
those kind of things that have the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.249 
those kind of things that have the
bigger<00:01:17.090> displays<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:19.110> nice

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bigger displays which look really nice

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.730 
bigger displays which look really nice
and<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.049> current<00:01:22.290> iphone

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and I don't know the current iphone

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350 
and I don't know the current iphone
screen<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.400> seems<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.909> old<00:01:24.119> now

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
screen just seems a little bit old now

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
screen just seems a little bit old now
like<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:24.900> been<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.170> size<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.680> while

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like it's been that size for a while

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
like it's been that size for a while
they've<00:01:26.189> never<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.549> changed<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.450> all

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
they've never really changed it at all

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.960 
they've never really changed it at all
so<00:01:28.350> it'd<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.650> nice<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> possibly<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.759> an

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
so it'd be nice to possibly have an

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.819 
so it'd be nice to possibly have an
edge-to-edge<00:01:30.150> display<00:01:30.810> that'd<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.619> quite

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
edge-to-edge display that'd be quite

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.100 
edge-to-edge display that'd be quite
nice<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
nice like to see that also there's the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.280 
nice like to see that also there's the
possibility<00:01:34.460> again<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.790> NFC<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.200> if

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
possibility again of NFC I don't know if

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.830 
possibility again of NFC I don't know if
you<00:01:37.380> guys<00:01:37.530> heard<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.189> originally<00:01:38.939> NFC<00:01:39.479> was

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you guys heard but originally NFC was

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
you guys heard but originally NFC was
coming<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> iphone<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> couple

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
coming to the iphone and then a couple

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
coming to the iphone and then a couple
of<00:01:41.670> weeks<00:01:41.729> ago<00:01:42.049> definitely<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.140> ruled<00:01:43.350> out

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
of weeks ago definitely was ruled out

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
of weeks ago definitely was ruled out
but<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.009> apparently<00:01:44.130> according<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but now apparently according to the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.080 
but now apparently according to the
source<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:45.840> NFC<00:01:46.500> chip<00:01:46.770> could<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.460> implemented

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
source an NFC chip could be implemented

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
source an NFC chip could be implemented
so<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.960> good<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.350> lastly

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so that would be good and lastly

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
so that would be good and lastly
apparently<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> iphone<00:01:51.299> five<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.540> feature

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
apparently the iphone five will feature

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
apparently the iphone five will feature
a<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.560> new<00:01:53.040> scratch<00:01:53.430> resistant<00:01:53.970> metal<00:01:54.180> design

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
a or new scratch resistant metal design

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
a or new scratch resistant metal design
similar<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.740> iphone<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
similar to the iphone one do you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.880 
similar to the iphone one do you
remember<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> iphone<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.079> looked<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> little

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

fashion conscious and I read an article
in<00:03:39.560> gizmodo<00:03:40.250> which<00:03:40.550> said<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:40.900> comparing<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
in gizmodo which said that comparing the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.540 
in gizmodo which said that comparing the
white<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.380> black<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.860> black<00:03:43.280> one<00:03:43.520> is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
white and the black the black one is

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.940 
white and the black the black one is
definitely<00:03:44.090> better<00:03:44.240> because<00:03:44.750> with<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.770> white

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
definitely better because with the white

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.920 
definitely better because with the white

saying<00:04:07.760> basically<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.750> black<00:04:08.930> one<00:04:09.200> just

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
