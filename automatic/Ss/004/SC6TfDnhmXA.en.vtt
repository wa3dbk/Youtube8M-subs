00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 video it is a bit different video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
 have you worked me what I'm going 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.840
 namely helping x a lot once 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 youtubers in the netherlands who make videos 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 or want to make videos 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.120
 just not very good for them 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.890
 is this video many of you know that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390
 I played and max and billy in the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.949
 vibrating machine boy girl 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 you can do this series online next week 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 in the description and in thin film doe 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 so I also come along and that movie 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 has been shot while making his seria 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.490
 where in that series see how max 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.289
 worship make a movie and lay it 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.270
 completely how that film was made 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 then I thought okay to myself why 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.329
 not I'm going to some things 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 tell about making videos 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 for the people who want a channel 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.770
 and how exactly 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.879
 should sit 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.710
 we always start with the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.510
 videos that you want to make think carefully 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 after what you want to make is also there 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.110
 for that it is close to what you like 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 think youtube is all about you as 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.010
 person you have to put yourself forward 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 come and most important thing is to choose 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.559
 what you want to make there is a whole 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 big difference between drama comedy 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.309
 entertainment went live stylishly it is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 such a world of difference and tit 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 easy to start with is vlogging 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.909
 so from very simple you grab the camera and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.189
 This is a follow those now 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.020
 the room goes on with you 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.880
 which asked only please remember if I 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.439
 go vlogging it can be very difficult on 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 some moments but not very many 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.369
 people from what crash loudly one x peat 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
 today so if you used to 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.880
 make is high for the is something you have 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 making you not making you a 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.509
 a good example comes to the fore 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.060
 I always want banjomovies 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.189
 make sure there is something in the video that way 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 bizarre that a fucked up is that there 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.790
 lingers like in the last thing the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.740
 actually fuck the tortilla like that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.119
 man I think that is really something bizarre city 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 stay with many people 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.170
 the magical adventures of village teal yes 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.170
 man 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.130
 first 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.170
 good times watch bad times 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.240
 ludo anyway 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.340
 euro then you come to the next one 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.530
 namely making drama is drama 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.840
 extremely difficult in the background jebo 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.489
 rods of breaking bath if you like it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.420
 series have not seen that you must 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.220
 actually 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 doubt if you want to make windows from 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 breaking bath 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.739
 shows how i find that difficult and beautiful 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.660
 drama can be for drama you already have 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.400
 good actors first 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.459
 You have to think about those plots that you 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.019
 makes drama is extremely difficult if you 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.519
 never have made videos can 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.470
 Begin the drama with you too 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.600
 direct yourself all the greatest possible 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.519
 challenge ever started with myself 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.200
 on youtube was live style 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.850
 nice and dirty with some friends before 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.769
 the camera and start with it 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.120
 assemble because let's be honest one 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.709
 bit of cocks with some friends 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600
 everyone can and it is always 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.970
 nice that you have fun with your friends 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.530
 plus you always talk about what you like and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.060
 of course that demand a lot of people 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.720
 wonder and horses how are you in that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.400
 for goodness sake boys started looking too 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.380
 but agree it is not a live couple 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.680
 bit more humor but still 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.840
 I knew from a beautiful forest I am going 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.200
 within five tips and what day can complete 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.200
 processing 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.459
 For example, people and saw you 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:20.269
 are still drinking and sweeping 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:24.560
 burgundy red on nl3 for the many hours 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:37.269
 back also you can be boss from the school as 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:37.269
 watch the tv and yes i feel the vrt 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.510
 probably with the victim now 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 no watching tv but a filling and that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.200
 your retirement age has gone 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:04.970
 you can save that no 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:06.950
 gas field or simply looking forward to not fuck 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.629
 you 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.000
 then has been a piece of one of the 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.010
 Earlier banjo movies and see how 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.910
 bad we were about four five years 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.440
 ago 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.419
 only by thinking about what you want 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.889
 you can also make something really nice 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.570
 make good what people want 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.520
 and that is really important 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.620
 you have to have something that people go to 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.720
 would like to see if that excuses 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.090
 deadly or whatever its thinking about 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.440
 something strong something is good for you 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.870
 example of being of course the 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.110
 excuses when I came in 2009 with the fresh 50 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.400
 I was always late and everywhere 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.200
 I am not now 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.360
 ok i am that now i am up 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.160
 potter but you don't know how 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.139
 closer to my light look for something 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.389
 close to you and increases that 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.669
 the camera is experiencing a show 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.440
 invent something better if necessary if you have one 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.880
 few interesting about that is it quite fat 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.800
 look like you would be riding a horse 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.050
 with nice music underneath and one 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.610
 gopro camera on your helmet are serious 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.750
 side to find thousands of videos about 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.950
 ballet that are good 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.450
 in fact I think that is something 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.340
 thousands of videos can be made 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.080
 he is concerned about football that are fat 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.169

 you have what you can do with 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.349
