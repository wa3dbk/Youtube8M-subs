home screen on the intercept I've had a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
home screen on the intercept I've had a
problem<00:01:04.170> where<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.949> tap<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> home<00:01:05.519> button

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
problem where if you tap the home button

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
problem where if you tap the home button
occasionally<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.600> doesn't<00:01:06.960> respond<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
occasionally it doesn't respond and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
occasionally it doesn't respond and
because<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> soft<00:01:08.970> button<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
because it's a soft button and not a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
because it's a soft button and not a
physical<00:01:10.020> hardware<00:01:10.500> button<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> sometimes

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
physical hardware button you sometimes

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
physical hardware button you sometimes
don't<00:01:11.610> even<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.150> you've<00:01:12.270> hit<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> key

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
don't even know if you've hit the key

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
don't even know if you've hit the key
properly<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> i<00:01:14.610> find<00:01:14.939> myself<00:01:15.090> tapping<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
properly so i find myself tapping the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.330 
properly so i find myself tapping the
button<00:01:15.900> five<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.380> six<00:01:16.560> times<00:01:16.650> before<00:01:17.250> it

button five or six times before it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
button five or six times before it
finally<00:01:17.549> gets<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.090> home<00:01:18.210> screen<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.140> may

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
finally gets to the home screen this may

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.300 
finally gets to the home screen this may
take<00:01:19.560> five<00:01:20.220> seconds<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> worst<00:01:21.210> case<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
take five seconds in the worst case and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870 
take five seconds in the worst case and
occasionally<00:01:23.310> even<00:01:23.610> brings<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.880> recently

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
occasionally even brings up the recently

occasionally even brings up the recently
used<00:01:26.909> applications<00:01:27.270> window<00:01:28.080> rather<00:01:28.320> than<00:01:28.590> the

used applications window rather than the
home<00:01:28.799> screen<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> back<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
home screen and you have to back out of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
home screen and you have to back out of
that<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.659> home<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.860> small

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that to get home so it's a small

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010 
that to get home so it's a small
annoyance<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.600> does<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> frustrating

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
annoyance but it does get frustrating

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
annoyance but it does get frustrating
when<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.619> run<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> few<00:01:35.400> times<00:01:35.460> every

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
when you run into this a few times every

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
when you run into this a few times every
day<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.680> other<00:01:37.680> people<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.070> reported<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
day and other people I've reported the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.980 
day and other people I've reported the
same<00:01:38.759> problem<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> intercept<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
same problem with the intercept so it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
same problem with the intercept so it
does<00:01:40.110> seem<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.560> fundamental<00:01:40.829> problem

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
does seem to be a fundamental problem

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
does seem to be a fundamental problem
with<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.000> phone<00:01:42.560> with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> Optimus<00:01:44.130> I've

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
with the phone with the Optimus I've

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
with the phone with the Optimus I've
never<00:01:44.490> had<00:01:44.700> any<00:01:44.880> problem<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> because

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
never had any problem like that because

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
never had any problem like that because
you<00:01:46.079> do<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> hardware<00:01:46.770> buttons<00:01:47.250> which

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you do have the hardware buttons which

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.030 
you do have the hardware buttons which
tell<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.630> immediately<00:01:49.049> through<00:01:49.680> tactile

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
tell you immediately through tactile

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.649 
tell you immediately through tactile
feedback<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.820> hit<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> button<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.509> not

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
feedback if you hit the button or not

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.020 
feedback if you hit the button or not
and<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.680> seems<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.310> responsive<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and it seems to be so responsive and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
and it seems to be so responsive and
never<00:01:54.149> lags<00:01:54.689> behind<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.579> always<00:01:56.579> goes<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
never lags behind and always goes to the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.289 
never lags behind and always goes to the
home<00:01:57.149> screen<00:01:57.180> immediately<00:01:59.149> let's<00:02:00.149> try

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
home screen immediately let's try

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.539 
home screen immediately let's try
running<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> software<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> we'll<00:02:02.340> load<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
running the software so we'll load the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120 
running the software so we'll load the
browser's<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.390> I'll<00:02:03.540> tap<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.469> each<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.860> at

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
browser's here I'll tap on each one at

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.240 
browser's here I'll tap on each one at
the<00:02:05.219> same<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:06.860> they<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.920> have

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the same time they do have

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
the same time they do have
accelerometers<00:02:08.849> built<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:10.140> view

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
accelerometers built in so you can view

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010 
accelerometers built in so you can view
web<00:02:10.979> pages<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.970> applications

in portrait or landscape mode and now
let's<00:02:21.300> try<00:02:21.510> loading<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.900> web<00:02:22.050> page<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:23.070> we'll

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
let's try loading a web page so we'll

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.000 
let's try loading a web page so we'll
bring<00:02:23.460> up<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> menu<00:02:23.850> screen<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> my

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
bring up the menu screen and go to my

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.790 
bring up the menu screen and go to my
bookmarks<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.110> let's<00:02:28.110> start<00:02:28.350> by<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.590> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
bookmarks and let's start by going to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.060 
bookmarks and let's start by going to
ESPN<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> Optimus

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
ESPN you can see that the Optimus

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.730 
ESPN you can see that the Optimus
finished<00:02:35.820> rendering<00:02:36.060> before<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.140> intercept

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
finished rendering before the intercept

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.530 
finished rendering before the intercept
it<00:02:37.860> even<00:02:38.070> started<00:02:38.400> rendering<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.000> I've<00:02:39.390> done

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it even started rendering and I've done

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.000 
it even started rendering and I've done
this<00:02:39.660> over<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.050> over<00:02:40.140> again<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.620> does<00:02:40.830> seem

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
this over and over again this does seem

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.190 
this over and over again this does seem
to<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.520> pretty<00:02:42.150> standard<00:02:42.660> result<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
to be a pretty standard result the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.990 
to be a pretty standard result the
Optimus<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.650> much<00:02:44.010> faster<00:02:44.220> loading<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
Optimus is much faster loading and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.300 
Optimus is much faster loading and
rendering<00:02:45.450> web<00:02:45.630> pages<00:02:46.050> let's<00:02:47.010> try<00:02:47.220> another

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
rendering web pages let's try another

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:55.090 
rendering web pages let's try another
one<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:50.130> time<00:02:50.370> we'll<00:02:50.610> load<00:02:50.820> accuweather<00:02:53.270> and

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
one this time we'll load accuweather and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.010 
one this time we'll load accuweather and
once<00:02:56.100> again<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.610> Optimus<00:02:57.180> easily<00:02:57.630> meets<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
once again the Optimus easily meets the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.990 
once again the Optimus easily meets the
intercept<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:59.370> let's<00:02:59.580> load<00:02:59.760> more

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
intercept now let's load more

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.960 
intercept now let's load more
complicated<00:03:00.540> page<00:03:00.840> something<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.970> slash

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
complicated page something like slash

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.880 
complicated page something like slash
dot

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.250 

the<00:03:10.430> optimist<00:03:10.850> have<00:03:10.970> started<00:03:11.360> displaying<00:03:12.160> and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the optimist have started displaying and

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.590 
the optimist have started displaying and
is<00:03:15.260> finished<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.640> intercept<00:03:17.240> is<00:03:17.360> still

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
is finished the intercept is still

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.670 
is finished the intercept is still
working<00:03:17.990> loading<00:03:18.980> those<00:03:19.190> ads<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.760> sidebars

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
these are both on Wi-Fi by the way still

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.430 
these are both on Wi-Fi by the way still
rendering<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.440> finished<00:03:31.390> now<00:03:32.390> another<00:03:32.870> big

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
rendering and finished now another big

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.720 
rendering and finished now another big
place<00:03:33.680> where<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.980> notice<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.430> increased

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
place where you notice the increased

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.000 
place where you notice the increased
responsiveness<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> Optimus<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.260> when

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
responsiveness of the Optimus is when

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.820 
responsiveness of the Optimus is when
you<00:03:37.130> use<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.489> pinch<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:38.180> zoom<00:03:38.209> feature<00:03:38.989> will

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
you use the pinch to zoom feature will

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.650 
you use the pinch to zoom feature will
just<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.310> here<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:40.970> very<00:03:41.300> smooth

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
just do that here and it's very smooth

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.650 
just do that here and it's very smooth
and<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:41.959> responds<00:03:42.410> immediately<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:44.239> get<00:03:44.420> good

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and it responds immediately you get good

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.600 
and it responds immediately you get good
feedback<00:03:44.900> on<00:03:45.350> your<00:03:45.530> action<00:03:45.920> on<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.850> intercept

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
feedback on your action on the intercept

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.680 
feedback on your action on the intercept
occasionally<00:03:49.610> you'll<00:03:49.760> start<00:03:50.090> pinching<00:03:50.330> and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
occasionally you'll start pinching and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.420 
occasionally you'll start pinching and
it<00:03:50.780> won't<00:03:50.989> respond<00:03:51.380> for<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.620> few<00:03:51.830> seconds<00:03:52.220> and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
it won't respond for a few seconds and

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.640 
it won't respond for a few seconds and
even<00:03:53.330> when<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.570> does<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.989> can<00:03:54.140> tell<00:03:54.290> it's<00:03:54.470> just

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
even when it does you can tell it's just

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.350 
even when it does you can tell it's just
a<00:03:54.739> little<00:03:55.010> bit<00:03:55.130> jerkier<00:03:55.760> doesn't<00:03:56.180> quite

here<00:04:18.340> okay<00:04:19.690> now<00:04:20.690> let's<00:04:20.720> do<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.650> quick<00:04:21.859> speed

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
here okay now let's do a quick speed

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.790 
here okay now let's do a quick speed
test<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.880> show<00:04:23.090> how<00:04:23.360> fast<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.229> two<00:04:24.380> phones<00:04:24.590> are

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
test to show how fast the two phones are

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.060 
test to show how fast the two phones are
in<00:04:24.830> terms<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.220> networking<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.590> we'll<00:04:27.710> do<00:04:27.860> one

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
in terms of networking so we'll do one

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.230 
in terms of networking so we'll do one
and<00:04:28.220> then<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.460> other<00:04:28.490> so<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:28.910> they're<00:04:29.150> not

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
and then the other so that they're not

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.330 
and then the other so that they're not

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.320 

okay<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.430> going<00:04:56.670> at<00:04:56.850> about<00:04:57.030> eight

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
okay so it's going at about eight

actually an unusual result usually the

Samsung is quite a bit slower than the

glitch<00:05:30.750> in<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.170> network<00:05:31.500> but<00:05:32.040> you<00:05:32.130> can<00:05:32.280> see

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
glitch in the network but you can see

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.070 
glitch in the network but you can see
that<00:05:32.460> for<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.790> most<00:05:32.940> part<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.690> phones<00:05:33.870> are<00:05:33.990> at

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
that for the most part the phones are at

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.500 
that for the most part the phones are at
least<00:05:34.200> comparable<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:35.010> terms<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.820> Wi-Fi<00:05:36.180> speed

what's<00:05:37.020> more<00:05:37.170> important<00:05:37.590> i<00:05:37.680> think<00:05:37.710> is

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
what's more important i think is

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.010 
what's more important i think is
rendering<00:05:38.430> speed<00:05:38.670> especially<00:05:39.660> in<00:05:39.960> that

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
rendering speed especially in that

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.070 
rendering speed especially in that

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470

the<00:05:49.410> intercept<00:05:49.800> right<00:05:49.980> now<00:05:50.160> so<00:05:50.370> i<00:05:50.400> can't<00:05:50.700> show

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
the intercept right now so i can't show

the intercept right now so i can't show
you<00:05:50.940> that<00:05:51.090> but<00:05:51.990> we<00:05:52.110> can<00:05:52.140> at<00:05:52.290> least<00:05:52.380> get<00:05:52.650> an<00:05:52.740> idea

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
you that but we can at least get an idea

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:11.239 
you that but we can at least get an idea
of<00:05:53.040> how<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.250> optimist<00:05:53.790> performs

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:11.249 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:20.110 

alright<00:06:11.999> about<00:06:12.209> 1.3<00:06:12.839> mega<00:06:13.079> bits<00:06:13.229> download

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.870 

and<00:06:20.240> just<00:06:21.229> under<00:06:21.440> 600<00:06:21.740> kilobits<00:06:22.310> per<00:06:22.430> second

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880

upload<00:06:23.210> speed<00:06:23.479> so<00:06:23.720> pretty<00:06:24.020> good<00:06:24.310> the<00:06:25.310> Optimus

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
upload speed so pretty good the Optimus

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.840 
upload speed so pretty good the Optimus
does<00:06:26.090> have<00:06:26.330> evdo<00:06:26.810> rev<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.530> in<00:06:27.979> comparison<00:06:28.820> with

does have evdo rev a in comparison with
Samsung's<00:06:29.510> evdo<00:06:30.199> rev<00:06:30.320> 0<00:06:30.590> so<00:06:31.340> this<00:06:31.580> does<00:06:31.790> have

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
Samsung's evdo rev 0 so this does have

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.700 
Samsung's evdo rev 0 so this does have
somewhat<00:06:32.300> faster<00:06:32.660> capability<00:06:33.260> in<00:06:33.350> terms<00:06:33.590> of
