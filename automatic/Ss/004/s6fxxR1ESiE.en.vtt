so for our drinking and cooking water we

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.309 
so for our drinking and cooking water we
put<00:00:02.970> it<00:00:03.060> through<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.270> distiller<00:00:03.810> as<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.140> just

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
put it through the distiller as I just

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.410 
put it through the distiller as I just
showed<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.920> normally<00:00:05.549> bring<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.089> to

pinch of salt to the water if you're

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220

minerals<00:00:28.080> from<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.320> body<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> want

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

minerals from the body but if you want
to<00:00:29.820> add<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.210> life<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.750> put<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> pinch<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to add some life to can put a pinch of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.650 
to add some life to can put a pinch of
salt<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.710> sea<00:00:31.980> salt<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.430> good<00:00:32.669> salt<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.360> give<00:00:33.570> it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
salt in sea salt a good salt and give it

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.540 
salt in sea salt a good salt and give it
a<00:00:33.750> stir<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:34.920> energize

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a stir and that will actually energize

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
a stir and that will actually energize
the<00:00:35.730> water<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.390> even<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.930> positive

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the water you can even put some positive

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560 
the water you can even put some positive
intention<00:00:37.980> into<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.309> water<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.420> it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
intention into the water because it's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
intention into the water because it's
very<00:00:39.719> impressionable<00:00:40.460> all<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:42.149> other

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
very impressionable all right some other

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850 
very impressionable all right some other
things<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.899> do<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> supercharge<00:00:43.590> your

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
things you can do to supercharge your

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
things you can do to supercharge your
water<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.850> new<00:00:45.660> product<00:00:45.899> called<00:00:46.140> add

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
water if is a new product called add

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.630 
water if is a new product called add
your<00:00:46.649> clarity<00:00:47.010> which<00:00:48.050> basically<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.640> form

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
your clarity which basically is a form

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
your clarity which basically is a form
from<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.030> hundred<00:00:51.120> percent<00:00:51.300> pure<00:00:51.780> black<00:00:52.110> mica

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
from one hundred percent pure black mica

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
from one hundred percent pure black mica
which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.809> rock

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
which is I think it's like a from a rock

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
which is I think it's like a from a rock
similar<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> zeolite<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.690> amazing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
similar to zeolite so it's an amazing

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.680 
similar to zeolite so it's an amazing
detoxification<00:00:59.300> mineralizing<00:01:01.129> liquid<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
detoxification mineralizing liquid and

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
detoxification mineralizing liquid and
it<00:01:03.690> totally<00:01:03.930> restructures<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.890> water<00:01:05.129> will

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it totally restructures your water will

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.149 
it totally restructures your water will
actually<00:01:05.790> pull<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> say<00:01:07.680> Dana<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
actually pull if you say Dana of a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.859 
actually pull if you say Dana of a
chlorine<00:01:08.460> filter<00:01:08.820> will<00:01:09.000> pull<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
chlorine filter will pull some of the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.420 
chlorine filter will pull some of the
fluoride<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> chlorine<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> water

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
fluoride and chlorine out of the water

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
fluoride and chlorine out of the water
it's<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:13.040> good<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.280> removing<00:01:14.700> toxins<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's that good for removing toxins so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's that good for removing toxins so
you<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> few<00:01:15.930> drops<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.590> into

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you just put a few drops of that into

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.600 
you just put a few drops of that into
your<00:01:16.950> water<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:21.049> then<00:01:22.049> you've<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.610> charged

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
your water and then you've got a charged

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.910 
your water and then you've got a charged
mineralized<00:01:24.240> water<00:01:24.540> another<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.650> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
mineralized water another thing you can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.670 
mineralized water another thing you can
do<00:01:26.130> though<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.909> recommend<00:01:27.540> doing<00:01:27.869> edgy

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
do though I don't recommend doing edgy

clarity and crystal energy but crystal

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
clarity and crystal energy but crystal
energy<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.290> also<00:01:31.619> something<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
energy is also something that you can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.780 
energy is also something that you can
put<00:01:32.490> into<00:01:32.700> water<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.630> highly<00:01:33.960> alkaline<00:01:34.790> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
put into water it's highly alkaline it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
put into water it's highly alkaline it
makes<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> water<00:01:36.360> wetter<00:01:36.720> which<00:01:37.170> means

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
makes the water wetter which means

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
makes the water wetter which means
nutrients<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:39.119> yourselves

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
nutrients can get in to yourselves

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
nutrients can get in to yourselves
easier<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> waste<00:01:40.409> products<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> come<00:01:41.579> out

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
easier and waste products can come out

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580 
easier and waste products can come out
of<00:01:41.850> yourselves<00:01:42.180> easier<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.110> makes<00:01:43.320> water

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
of yourselves easier so it makes water

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.340 
of yourselves easier so it makes water
more<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.149> glacial<00:01:45.149> milk<00:01:45.450> water<00:01:45.659> save<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
more like glacial milk water save of the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.020 
more like glacial milk water save of the
hunters<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.460> these<00:01:47.579> long<00:01:47.850> live

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.819 
hunters and some of these long live
communities<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> guy<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.200> developed<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
communities the guy that developed this

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.010 
communities the guy that developed this
developed<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.880> trying<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> emulate<00:01:51.659> these

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
developed it trying to emulate these

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.080 
developed it trying to emulate these
waters<00:01:52.560> coming<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.189> pristine<00:01:53.610> glacial

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
waters coming from pristine glacial

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
waters coming from pristine glacial
areas<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.229> another<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.740> can

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
areas so that's another way you can

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.580 
areas so that's another way you can
improve<00:01:56.729> say<00:01:57.240> distilled<00:01:57.689> water<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.110> any<00:01:58.320> water

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
improve say distilled water or any water

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
improve say distilled water or any water
for<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> matter<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.820> much<00:02:00.479> more

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
for that matter and make it much more

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
for that matter and make it much more
bioavailable<00:02:01.130> which<00:02:02.130> means<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.759> dissipates

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
bioavailable which means it dissipates

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.260 
bioavailable which means it dissipates
up<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.979> enhances<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.340> uptake<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.700> nutrients

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
up or enhances the uptake of nutrients

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
up or enhances the uptake of nutrients
and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.140> expulsion<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:08.209> metabolic<00:02:09.209> wastes

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and the expulsion of metabolic wastes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.170 
and the expulsion of metabolic wastes
from<00:02:09.720> their<00:02:09.929> cells<00:02:10.819> another<00:02:11.819> thing<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.060> can

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
from their cells another thing you can

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
from their cells another thing you can
do<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.629> got<00:02:13.140> mega<00:02:13.379> hydrate

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
do I've got mega hydrate

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.800 
do I've got mega hydrate
here<00:02:14.159> these<00:02:14.549> are<00:02:14.610> capsules<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.450> can<00:02:15.659> actually

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
here these are capsules you can actually

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.289 
here these are capsules you can actually
tip<00:02:16.110> them<00:02:16.260> into<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> water<00:02:17.180> similar<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
tip them into the water similar to

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.240 
tip them into the water similar to
crystal<00:02:18.659> energy<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.739> don't<00:02:19.920> need<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.159> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
crystal energy but you don't need to you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.830 
crystal energy but you don't need to you
can<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.640> put<00:02:20.790> them<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.420> take<00:02:21.689> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
can actually just put them to take the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.470 
can actually just put them to take the
capsules<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.560> they'll<00:02:23.519> actually<00:02:23.760> hydrate

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
capsules and they'll actually hydrate

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.880 
capsules and they'll actually hydrate
you<00:02:24.629> from<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> inside<00:02:25.049> out<00:02:25.290> they'll

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you from the inside out they'll

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.490 
you from the inside out they'll
basically<00:02:26.519> make<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.030> fluids<00:02:27.689> in<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.959> body

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
basically make the fluids in your body

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.850 
basically make the fluids in your body
uptake<00:02:29.069> minerals<00:02:29.519> better<00:02:30.079> expel<00:02:31.079> the<00:02:31.440> wastes

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
uptake minerals better expel the wastes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.580 
uptake minerals better expel the wastes
etc<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.579> there<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.329> few<00:02:33.360> ways<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.319> there

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
etc so there just a few ways and there

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.140 
etc so there just a few ways and there
are<00:02:34.680> many<00:02:34.829> other<00:02:35.040> ways<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.849> can

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
are many other ways that you can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.229 
are many other ways that you can
supercharge<00:02:36.810> your<00:02:37.110> water<00:02:38.000> purify<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.030> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
supercharge your water purify it and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.360 
supercharge your water purify it and
then<00:02:39.420> supercharge<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.170> again<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.010> hopefully

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
then supercharge it again so hopefully

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.429 
then supercharge it again so hopefully
that's<00:02:41.549> given<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.209> few<00:02:42.659> ideas<00:02:42.690> as<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> what

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
that's given you a few ideas as to what

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.140 
that's given you a few ideas as to what
you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.310> drinking<00:02:44.519> water<00:02:44.730> I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
you can do with drinking water I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
you can do with drinking water I
definitely<00:02:45.569> like<00:02:45.840> pure<00:02:46.109> water<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.560> that's

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
definitely like pure water and that's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.470 
definitely like pure water and that's
why<00:02:46.859> I<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:47.099> for<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.310> whole<00:02:47.519> house<00:02:47.790> system<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
why I go for the whole house system and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.569 
why I go for the whole house system and
the<00:02:48.870> distiller<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:49.859> charging<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> with

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
the distiller and then charging it with

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.239 
the distiller and then charging it with
these<00:02:50.760> products
