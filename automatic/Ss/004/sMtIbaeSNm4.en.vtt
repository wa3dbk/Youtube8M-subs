00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.699 
original by the way i'm not going to say
what<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.700> means<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.120> um<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.200> video<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
what it means but um so for this video I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.400 
what it means but um so for this video I
said<00:02:41.069> do<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> different<00:02:41.760> twist<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.959> because<00:02:43.380> I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
said do a different twist so because I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.070 
said do a different twist so because I
have<00:02:43.680> these<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.489> thought<00:02:45.060> why<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.450> also<00:02:45.750> brings

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
have these I thought why not also brings

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080 
have these I thought why not also brings
some<00:02:46.410> old<00:02:46.739> issues<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.610> pretty<00:02:47.820> much<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
some old issues that pretty much the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.390 
some old issues that pretty much the
three<00:02:48.360> iconic<00:02:48.780> air<00:02:49.140> jordan<00:02:49.590> ones<00:02:49.800> i<00:02:50.040> mean

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
obviously they're not the original ones

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.530 
obviously they're not the original ones
but<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.350> were<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.730> retros<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.239> don't
