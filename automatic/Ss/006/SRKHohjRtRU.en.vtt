person<00:01:13.590> he's<00:01:14.010> playing<00:01:14.250> against<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:15.420> his<00:01:15.689> own

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
person he's playing against just his own

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
ability to play the shots he look at hit

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.300 
ability to play the shots he look at hit
those<00:01:18.630> shots<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.380> genius<00:01:19.890> shots<00:01:20.159> he

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
those shots that are genius shots he

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
those shots that are genius shots he
look<00:01:20.490> makes<00:01:20.670> him<00:01:20.790> look<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.090> everyday<00:01:21.420> shot

look makes him look like everyday shot
so<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.320> certainly<00:01:23.130> has<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so he certainly has got all the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.020 
so he certainly has got all the
abilities<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.890> world<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
abilities in the world and I think the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
abilities in the world and I think the
main<00:01:27.210> thing<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> he's<00:01:27.960> got<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> he<00:01:28.439> he

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
main thing is that he's got is he he

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
main thing is that he's got is he he
just<00:01:29.159> plays<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.579> under<00:01:29.820> pressure<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
just plays well under pressure and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
just plays well under pressure and
that's<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> thing<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:32.220> takes<00:01:32.490> him

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that's the thing that put takes him

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
that's the thing that put takes him
apart<00:01:32.909> from<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.329> other<00:01:33.450> players<00:01:33.750> well

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
apart from all the other players well

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
apart from all the other players well
Rod<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.619> hear<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:35.040> people<00:01:35.310> say<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> phrase

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
Rod we hear some people say the phrase

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.569 
Rod we hear some people say the phrase
greatest<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.750> times<00:01:37.110> he's<00:01:37.350> only<00:01:37.500> 24<00:01:38.100> when

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
greatest of all times he's only 24 when

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.719 
greatest of all times he's only 24 when
you<00:01:38.670> hear<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> say<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
you hear that what would you say to that

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.730 
you hear that what would you say to that
well<00:01:41.729> he's<00:01:41.880> certainly<00:01:42.000> capable<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:43.259> making<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
well he's certainly capable of making it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
well he's certainly capable of making it
but<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.790> age<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.299> probably<00:01:45.750> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
but I think at this age is probably a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.480 
but I think at this age is probably a
little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.200> too<00:01:46.380> young<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.829> anybody<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.369> be

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
little bit too young to anybody to be

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.569 
little bit too young to anybody to be
saying<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.350> he<00:01:49.350> certainly<00:01:49.680> has<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.369> all

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
saying that but he certainly has got all

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.020

the<00:01:50.909> shots<00:01:51.149> he's<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.659> everything<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the shots he's got everything that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
the shots he's got everything that
anybody<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.780> as<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> tennis<00:01:55.439> player

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
anybody would want in as a tennis player

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.910 
anybody would want in as a tennis player
so<00:01:55.979> I'd<00:01:56.520> say<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.270> let's<00:01:57.930> let<00:01:58.649> him<00:01:58.799> get

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so I'd say you know let's let him get

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
so I'd say you know let's let him get
further<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.520> down<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> line<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.360> say<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
further on down the line and say that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.080 
further on down the line and say that
that<00:02:01.560> he's<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> greatest<00:02:02.430> person<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.939> ever

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that he's the greatest person that ever

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
that he's the greatest person that ever
played<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> game<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.530> he's<00:02:04.890> certainly

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
played the game I think he's certainly

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.119 
played the game I think he's certainly
capable<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.500> whether<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.009> look

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
capable of it you know whether you look

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.300 
capable of it you know whether you look
at<00:02:08.690> joe's<00:02:09.690> pizza

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
at joe's pizza

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.100 
at joe's pizza
purrs<00:02:10.520> who<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:11.030> thought<00:02:11.390> when<00:02:11.660> he<00:02:11.780> came<00:02:11.959> along

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
purrs who I thought when he came along

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.839 
purrs who I thought when he came along
he<00:02:12.530> was<00:02:12.680> had<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.160> great<00:02:13.340> person

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
he was had to be the great person

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.449 
he was had to be the great person
yourself<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:15.230> Rogers<00:02:15.980> got<00:02:16.130> all<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
yourself like but Rogers got all the

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.760 
yourself like but Rogers got all the
shots<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.030> certainly<00:02:17.989> capable<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.470> being<00:02:18.650> a

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
shots and certainly capable of being a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.470 
shots and certainly capable of being a
great<00:02:18.950> player<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.489> hopefully<00:02:19.910> he<00:02:20.420> will

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
great player and hopefully he will

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.809 
great player and hopefully he will
continue<00:02:20.780> with<00:02:21.080> his<00:02:21.230> game<00:02:21.500> he<00:02:21.770> loves<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.610> game

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
continue with his game he loves the game

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.760 
continue with his game he loves the game
he<00:02:23.030> respects<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> game<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:24.650> that's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
he respects the game and I think that's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.080 
he respects the game and I think that's
one<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.220> big<00:02:25.959> feelings<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.200> he<00:02:27.500> seems<00:02:27.890> to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
one of the big feelings that he seems to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.970 
one of the big feelings that he seems to
protrude<00:02:29.090> was<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.840> great<00:02:30.050> great<00:02:30.410> shot<00:02:30.709> maker

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
protrude was the great great shot maker

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.780 
protrude was the great great shot maker
he's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.370> great<00:02:31.640> player<00:02:32.560> Steve<00:02:33.560> would<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.640> do

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
he's a great player Steve would you do

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.160 
he's a great player Steve would you do
that<00:02:34.910> for<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.180> greatest<00:02:35.599> of<00:02:35.690> all<00:02:35.810> times<00:02:36.019> how

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
that for a greatest of all times how

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.589 
that for a greatest of all times how
does<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.380> register<00:02:36.769> with<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.360> think<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
does that register with you I think on a

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.780 
does that register with you I think on a
relative<00:02:39.140> basis<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.370> couldn't<00:02:40.670> make

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
relative basis that you couldn't make

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.789 
relative basis that you couldn't make
that<00:02:40.819> argument<00:02:41.150> yet<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:42.140> know<00:02:42.230> it's<00:02:42.350> respect

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
that argument yet you know it's respect

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.680 
that argument yet you know it's respect
due<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.069> Pete<00:02:43.250> Sampras<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.850> rod<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.630> many

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
due to Pete Sampras and rod and so many

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.110 
due to Pete Sampras and rod and so many
other<00:02:44.930> great<00:02:45.019> players<00:02:45.319> on<00:02:45.830> an<00:02:46.160> absolute<00:02:46.370> basis

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
other great players on an absolute basis

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.330 
other great players on an absolute basis
i<00:02:47.150> think<00:02:47.450> unequivocally<00:02:48.200> roger<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
i think unequivocally roger is the the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.550 
i think unequivocally roger is the the
most<00:02:49.370> talented<00:02:50.000> greatest<00:02:50.959> player<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.170> all

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
most talented greatest player of all

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.890 
most talented greatest player of all
time<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:52.069> think<00:02:52.880> tennis<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.330> general<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.750> bar

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
time I think tennis in general the bar

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.110 
time I think tennis in general the bar
has<00:02:54.110> been<00:02:54.140> raised<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.950> high<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.489> he's<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.880> top

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
has been raised so high and he's the top

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.970 
has been raised so high and he's the top
of<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.630> think<00:02:57.380> he's<00:02:57.470> actually<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.920> of

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
of it so I think he's actually one of

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.410 
of it so I think he's actually one of
the<00:02:58.069> greatest<00:02:58.310> athletes<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> history<00:02:59.360> of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
the greatest athletes in the history of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.539 
the greatest athletes in the history of
sports<00:02:59.720> why<00:03:00.349> is<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.680> then<00:03:00.830> ste<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.310> there's

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
sports why is it then ste that there's

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.580 
sports why is it then ste that there's
so<00:03:01.700> few<00:03:01.730> people<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.690> general<00:03:02.720> sporting

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
so few people in the general sporting

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.559 
so few people in the general sporting
public<00:03:03.920> or<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:04.549> beginning<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.269> learn

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
public or just now beginning to learn

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.600 
public or just now beginning to learn
about<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:06.019> guy<00:03:06.230> when<00:03:06.739> he's<00:03:06.890> accomplished<00:03:07.519> so

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
about this guy when he's accomplished so

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.500 
about this guy when he's accomplished so
much<00:03:07.640> already<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.410> think<00:03:09.730> he<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.760> not<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.060> person

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
much already I think he is not a person

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.120 
much already I think he is not a person
who<00:03:11.540> was<00:03:11.690> going<00:03:11.720> out<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.349> seeking<00:03:12.920> attention

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
who was going out in seeking attention

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.610 
who was going out in seeking attention
he<00:03:13.849> is<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:13.970> person<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.480> warrants<00:03:15.170> attention

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
he is a person that warrants attention

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.920 
he is a person that warrants attention
and<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.730> gestation<00:03:17.269> period<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.630> probably

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
and so the gestation period is probably

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.560 
and so the gestation period is probably
a<00:03:18.019> little<00:03:18.470> longer<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.850> coming<00:03:20.269> on<00:03:20.390> now

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
a little longer and it's coming on now

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.390 
a little longer and it's coming on now

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
think that the one one thing I thought

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.390 
think that the one one thing I thought
stay<00:05:11.250> visit<00:05:11.670> you<00:05:12.410> Roger<00:05:13.410> needs<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.980> challenge

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
stay visit you Roger needs a challenge

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.950 
stay visit you Roger needs a challenge
it<00:05:14.670> needs<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.210> competitor<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.810> have<00:05:15.900> a

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
it needs a competitor to have a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.710 
it needs a competitor to have a
challenge<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:17.130> nadal<00:05:17.970> may<00:05:18.240> be<00:05:18.300> a<00:05:18.420> great

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
challenge and if nadal may be a great

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.210 
challenge and if nadal may be a great
challenge<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.380> think<00:05:19.590> gradak<00:05:19.980> is<00:05:20.100> a

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
challenge and I think gradak is a

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
challenge and I think gradak is a
challenge<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.330> you're<00:05:21.690> going<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.870> have<00:05:21.930> a

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
challenge and so you're going to have a

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.040 
challenge and so you're going to have a
competitive<00:05:22.890> juices<00:05:23.640> there<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.870> will

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
competitive juices there and that will

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.100 
competitive juices there and that will
expand<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.950> make<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.570> tennis<00:05:27.570> game<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.050> the
