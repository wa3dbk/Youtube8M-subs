you're really able to look also able to
be<00:00:54.350> categorized<00:00:54.890> into<00:00:55.129> about<00:00:55.460> three

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
be categorized into about three

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.119 
be categorized into about three
different<00:00:56.650> maybe<00:00:57.650> four<00:00:58.989> colors<00:00:59.989> maybe<00:01:00.860> three

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
different maybe four colors maybe three

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.880 
different maybe four colors maybe three

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
okay so if you look even at the money

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.240 
okay so if you look even at the money
system<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.610> poor<00:01:05.110> medium<00:01:06.110> rich<00:01:06.409> okay

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
optimal extreme isn't the earth also

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.190 
optimal extreme isn't the earth also
divided<00:01:31.579> like<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.060> yeah<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.450> two<00:01:32.630> poles<00:01:32.840> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
divided like that yeah the two poles and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.789 
divided like that yeah the two poles and
you<00:01:33.259> have<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.380> center<00:01:33.740> point<00:01:35.409> if<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.530> look<00:01:36.679> at

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
you have a center point if you look at

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.709 
you have a center point if you look at
the<00:01:36.920> lines<00:01:37.159> everything<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.179> blaring<00:01:38.450> on

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
the lines everything is blaring on

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.429 
the lines everything is blaring on
separation<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.460> have<00:01:40.579> different<00:01:40.850> oh<00:01:41.439> and

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
separation you have different oh and

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.160 
separation you have different oh and
