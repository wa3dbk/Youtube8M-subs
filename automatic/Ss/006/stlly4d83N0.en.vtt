00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.500
 hi friends how are they servetto castle 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.630
 president of the wall and today I love you 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.610
 talk about a topic that I think 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.680
 very important the abandonment of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.600
 pets have been put to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.210
 think what relationship can exist between 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.740
 abandoning a pet 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.060
 because we think it's an old toy 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 or a simple object that has no life or 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.380
 who does not have feelings thoughts 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.079
 go as anything we want to 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.480
 the trash with the consequences that this 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.730
 action can have on our children 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.000
 what are we teaching them to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.560
 the children when we throw to the street to a 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.020
 pet because it is a nuisance 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.110
 because it's expensive to keep it because it's done 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 pee all the time good we're going to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.560
 watch this next video that is material 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.050
 original of the wall 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.130
 where it gives us a very clear message of what 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.680
 is what we teach children 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.300
 when we abandon our general of 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.400

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.620

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.100

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.030
 to be taking care of it you have to give it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.130
 eating you have to take it to the doctor is a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.190
 clog and poop all the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 time but nothing you'll understand is 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.090
 part of growing 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.470
 We can not be together I want you to know 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.540
 that I 'm really sorry 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.540
 to me how are we going to see 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.870
 I'm very repeated the animals are not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.270
 objects we should not even call 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250
 the pets are our companions 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.010
 life and he's always on the bike to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.879
 we 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.879
 person 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.180
 but why 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.010
 I am part of your family and please do not 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290
 say nonsense look you have to be 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.610
 caring you have to feed him there is 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.230
 take you to the doctor 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.770
 you are a nuisance and this team makes you 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.550
 for all the time you will understand it is 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.550
 part of growing 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.970
 the first good for us 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.970
 they were there 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.400
 and nobody noticed a 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.650
 strange behavior this is very 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.240
 important since they were so 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.100
 used to carry out this type 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.440
 of practices that for them were 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.600
 absolutely abnormal if you or I 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.030
 we were in a place where there 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.040
 many people and we had planned to take 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.140
 a machine pistol and kill the 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.240
 people surely the people that we 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.280
 some could not perceive if we are 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.690
 nervous or not but someone that we 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.730
 I knew he saw that we are 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.190
 behaving in some strange way 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.870
 different a little weird could you say what 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.420
 What's wrong with you? 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.580
 happening that you feel bad or something 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.460
 and here the important thing is that as I said 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.110
 nobody noticed or felt that they had 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 some strange behavior 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.170
 the next important step to define 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.360
 here is that when the clinical psychiatrist 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.960
 of the fbi spoke with the parents of these 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.960
 boys
