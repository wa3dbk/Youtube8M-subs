00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.540 
okay so there you have it there's the
sleeves<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.390> kind<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.410> bent<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.040> bit<00:02:21.250> but

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
sleeves I kind of like bent a bit but

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.339 
sleeves I kind of like bent a bit but
they<00:02:22.150> usually<00:02:22.270> get<00:02:22.540> straightened<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:23.110> when

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
they usually get straightened out when

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.050 
they usually get straightened out when
they're<00:02:23.470> bent<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.860> when<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.880> actually

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
they're bent like this when you actually

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.870 
they're bent like this when you actually
play<00:02:25.360> with<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.599> cards<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.550> didn't<00:02:27.550> really<00:02:27.670> had

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
play with the cards I didn't really had

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.050 
play with the cards I didn't really had
like<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.090> holofoil<00:02:28.690> back<00:02:29.050> though<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:30.060> never

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
like a holofoil back though I never

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.030 
like a holofoil back though I never
really<00:02:31.510> liked<00:02:31.750> sleeves<00:02:32.080> off<00:02:32.349> low<00:02:32.560> backs<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:32.980> I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
really liked sleeves off low backs but I

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.220 
really liked sleeves off low backs but I
