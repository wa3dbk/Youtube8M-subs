the<00:02:19.910> only<00:02:20.180> minor<00:02:20.480> complaint<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:21.530> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the only minor complaint I have here is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
the only minor complaint I have here is
that<00:02:21.800> he<00:02:22.100> kind<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.760> appears<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.360> no<00:02:23.570> neck

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
that he kind of appears to have no neck

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.680 
that he kind of appears to have no neck
I<00:02:24.459> think<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> fault<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.300> Cape

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
I think this is the fault of the Cape

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.860 
I think this is the fault of the Cape
but<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.800> only<00:02:27.920> makes<00:02:28.190> them<00:02:28.310> look<00:02:28.760> mildly<00:02:29.390> goofy

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
but it only makes them look mildly goofy

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:41.190 
but it only makes them look mildly goofy
it's<00:02:30.320> still<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> pretty<00:02:31.040> good<00:02:31.220> head<00:02:31.400> sculpt

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200
