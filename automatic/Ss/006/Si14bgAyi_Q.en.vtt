like<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:02.190> in<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.460> last<00:00:02.639> video<00:00:02.909> I<00:00:02.939> had<00:00:03.120> a

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
like this so in the last video I had a

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.720 
like this so in the last video I had a
bunch<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.449> issues<00:00:03.780> in<00:00:04.170> regards<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> cloth<00:00:05.310> not

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
bunch of issues in regards to cloth not

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.330 
bunch of issues in regards to cloth not
behaving<00:00:06.060> properly<00:00:06.890> and<00:00:07.890> then<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.130> got<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
behaving properly and then I got a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.709 
behaving properly and then I got a
around<00:00:09.150> them<00:00:09.540> by<00:00:10.790> simply<00:00:11.790> instantiating<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
around them by simply instantiating the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.099 
around them by simply instantiating the
ship<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.170> runtime<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.540> then<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.719> actually

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
ship at runtime and then one actually

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.029 
ship at runtime and then one actually
gets<00:00:16.320> destroyed

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
gets destroyed

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.670 
gets destroyed
I<00:00:17.070> simply<00:00:18.000> reinstate<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.289> different

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I simply reinstate it in a different

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.150 
I simply reinstate it in a different
position

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
position

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210 
position
I<00:00:20.340> don't<00:00:21.300> reuse<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.439> ship<00:00:22.619> anymore

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
I don't reuse the ship anymore

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.870 
I don't reuse the ship anymore
I<00:00:23.250> simply<00:00:24.650> recreate<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.160> seems<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
I simply recreate it it seems to be the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
I simply recreate it it seems to be the
only<00:00:26.910> way<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.900> around<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.740> issues<00:00:29.130> with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
only way to get around the issues with

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.209 
only way to get around the issues with
cloth<00:00:30.320> then<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.410> works<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:33.950> also<00:00:34.950> made<00:00:35.190> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
cloth then it works I also made it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.410 
cloth then it works I also made it
possible<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.940> view<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> damage<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> ship

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
possible to view the damage to the ship

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.740 
possible to view the damage to the ship
by<00:00:40.460> creating<00:00:41.460> particle<00:00:42.059> effects<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> ship

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
by creating particle effects on the ship

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
by creating particle effects on the ship
itself<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.350> here<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> lower<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> ship's<00:00:44.640> health

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
itself I here I lower the ship's health

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.529 
itself I here I lower the ship's health
and<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.350> more<00:00:46.500> fires<00:00:46.770> appear<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and more and more fires appear on the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
and more and more fires appear on the
ship<00:00:48.719> itself<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:50.270> raise<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.600> lower<00:00:52.340> sail

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
ship itself as I raise or lower sail

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.490 
ship itself as I raise or lower sail
health<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.110> become<00:00:55.410> tattered

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
health you can see them become tattered

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.630 
health you can see them become tattered
now<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> course<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> ship<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.489> be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now of course the ship is not gonna be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
now of course the ship is not gonna be
moving<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.239> quickly<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.170> this

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
moving this quickly when it's this

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.460 
moving this quickly when it's this
damaged<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.570> idea<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:06.470> for

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
damaged but you get the idea I think for

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.370 
damaged but you get the idea I think for
the<00:01:07.950> actual<00:01:08.540> effects<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:10.020> thinking<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the actual effects I was thinking it

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.700 
the actual effects I was thinking it
would<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.500> nice<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.610> use<00:01:12.000> them<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.229> primary

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
would be nice to use them as a primary

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340 
would be nice to use them as a primary
means<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.400> showing<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> damage<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
means of showing the damage down to the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
means of showing the damage down to the
ship<00:01:16.619> rather<00:01:17.310> than<00:01:17.490> having<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
ship rather than having some kind of a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.429 
ship rather than having some kind of a
health<00:01:18.600> bar<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> fast<00:01:20.939> also<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> wind

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
health bar or and fast also for the wind

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
health bar or and fast also for the wind
you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> pennant<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you can actually see that the pennant is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.240 
you can actually see that the pennant is
a<00:01:24.210> great<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.110> displaying<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.860> way<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a great way of displaying which way the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
a great way of displaying which way the
wind<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> flowing<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.200> even<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
wind is flowing so I don't even have to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.499 
wind is flowing so I don't even have to
use<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.100> gizmo<00:01:29.310> right<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> wind<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
use this gizmo right here for the wind I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.440 
use this gizmo right here for the wind I
can<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> pennant<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.520> course

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
can just look at the pennant of course

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.859 
can just look at the pennant of course
chances<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> camera

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
chances are for the game the camera

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.890 
chances are for the game the camera
might<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.710> close<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
might not be this close to it not this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
might not be this close to it not this
close<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> ship<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.710> mean<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.130> maybe<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
close to the ship I mean so maybe the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.450 
close to the ship I mean so maybe the
pan<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.360> be<00:01:42.509> visible<00:01:42.750> we'll<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:44.310> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
pan will not be visible we'll see if it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.010 
pan will not be visible we'll see if it
is<00:01:44.549> visible<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.149> definitely<00:01:45.659> would<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is visible I definitely would like to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
is visible I definitely would like to
avoid<00:01:46.500> having<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.840> UI<00:01:48.840> elements<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
avoid having to use UI elements if I can

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.620 
avoid having to use UI elements if I can
just<00:01:50.970> use<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.869> environment<00:01:52.680> itself<00:01:54.979> as<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
just use the environment itself as I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.230 
just use the environment itself as I
added<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.810> particles<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.850> smoke

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
added these particles here of smoke

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.709 
added these particles here of smoke
particles<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.960> quickly<00:02:01.350> realized<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
particles I quickly realized that I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.530 
particles I quickly realized that I
cannot<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.290> wind<00:02:04.500> zone<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.390> make<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
cannot use the wind zone to make the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350 
cannot use the wind zone to make the
enemies<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.700> wind<00:02:08.700> zone<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.209> not

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
enemies because wind zone is not

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.130 
enemies because wind zone is not
accessible<00:02:09.810> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> script<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> mesh

previous<00:02:11.680> video<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:12.190> also<00:02:13.180> could<00:02:13.450> not<00:02:13.480> access

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
previous video I also could not access

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.699 
previous video I also could not access
any<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.620> these<00:02:14.950> properties<00:02:15.400> right<00:02:15.819> here<00:02:16.709> from

scripting<00:02:18.250> either<00:02:18.490> none<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.630> seems<00:02:20.410> to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
scripting either none of this seems to

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.360 
scripting either none of this seems to
be<00:02:20.590> available<00:02:22.140> which<00:02:23.140> meant<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.040> actually

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
be available which meant that I actually

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670 
be available which meant that I actually
had<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.970> modify<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> position<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
had to modify the position of the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.949 
had to modify the position of the
particles<00:02:27.220> one<00:02:27.640> at<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.940> time<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.420> order<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.780> make

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
particles one at a time in order to make

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.260 
particles one at a time in order to make
them<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:30.010> affected<00:02:30.490> by<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.670> way<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
them be affected by the way that's the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.980 
them be affected by the way that's the
way<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.450> see<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> right<00:02:32.140> now<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.660> it's<00:02:34.810> kind<00:02:34.959> of

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
way you see it right now so it's kind of

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.710 
way you see it right now so it's kind of
a<00:02:35.080> hacky<00:02:35.320> way<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> do<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.950> but<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.989> does<00:02:38.200> work

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a hacky way to do it but it does work

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.910 
a hacky way to do it but it does work
here<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.989> actually<00:02:41.140> see<00:02:41.319> me<00:02:41.560> train<00:02:41.890> for

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
here you can actually see me train for

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.060 
here you can actually see me train for
all<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> particles<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.540> adding<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.800> wind

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
all the particles and adding the wind

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.800 
all the particles and adding the wind
movement<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.580> them<00:02:46.560> hacky<00:02:47.560> bucket<00:02:47.890> works

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
movement to them hacky bucket works

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.840 
movement to them hacky bucket works
and<00:02:49.810> speaking<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.860> wind<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.670> wind

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
and speaking of the wind the wind

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.449 
and speaking of the wind the wind
actually<00:02:52.390> affects<00:02:52.750> movement<00:02:53.050> now<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
actually affects movement now so if I

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.130 
actually affects movement now so if I
was<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> move<00:02:54.970> against<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.690> wind<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
was to move against the wind the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.170 
was to move against the wind the
movement<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.220> ship<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.730> noticeably

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
movement of the ship will be noticeably

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
movement of the ship will be noticeably
slower<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.800> us<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.130> move<00:03:00.310> with<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.910> wind

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
slower and for us to move with the wind

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.420 
slower and for us to move with the wind
the<00:03:01.720> movement<00:03:02.050> on<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.230> ship<00:03:02.440> will<00:03:02.800> be<00:03:02.950> faster

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
the movement on the ship will be faster

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.430 
the movement on the ship will be faster
of<00:03:04.000> course<00:03:04.239> right<00:03:04.420> now<00:03:04.450> there<00:03:04.780> isn't<00:03:04.989> much

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
of course right now there isn't much

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.940 
of course right now there isn't much
wind

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
wind

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.920 
wind
so<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.610> movement<00:03:06.790> will<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.720> much

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
so the movement will not be that much

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.400 
so the movement will not be that much
faster<00:03:09.269> but<00:03:10.269> as<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> wind<00:03:10.630> picks<00:03:10.690> up<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
faster but as the wind picks up the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.960 
faster but as the wind picks up the
shape<00:03:11.620> will<00:03:11.769> move<00:03:11.920> faster<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.370> faster<00:03:12.459> with

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
shape will move faster and faster with

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.479 
shape will move faster and faster with
it<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.470> also<00:03:14.470> made<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.769> possible<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.370> have

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
it I also made it possible to have

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.670 
it I also made it possible to have
different<00:03:16.000> kinds<00:03:16.329> of<00:03:16.390> ships<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.019> some<00:03:17.410> ships

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
different kinds of ships so some ships

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.710 
different kinds of ships so some ships
will<00:03:17.950> actually<00:03:18.400> move<00:03:18.880> faster<00:03:19.360> when<00:03:19.570> they're

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
will actually move faster when they're

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.990 
will actually move faster when they're
moving<00:03:20.549> perpendicular<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.850> winds

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
moving perpendicular to the winds

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.600 
moving perpendicular to the winds
direction<00:03:22.510> while<00:03:23.079> others<00:03:23.440> like<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.400> one

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
direction while others like this one

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.009 
direction while others like this one
will<00:03:24.910> move<00:03:25.060> faster<00:03:25.510> when<00:03:25.750> they're<00:03:25.870> moving

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
will move faster when they're moving

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.250 
will move faster when they're moving
with<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.799> winds<00:03:27.010> direction<00:03:30.810> I've<00:03:31.810> also<00:03:31.959> made

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
with the winds direction I've also made

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.400 
with the winds direction I've also made
it<00:03:32.410> possible<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:34.060> ships<00:03:34.390> from<00:03:34.750> sales<00:03:35.200> to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
it possible for the ships from sales to

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.810 
it possible for the ships from sales to
actually<00:03:35.799> extend<00:03:36.730> as<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.590> ship<00:03:38.799> moves<00:03:39.130> with

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
actually extend as the ship moves with

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.250 
actually extend as the ship moves with
the<00:03:39.970> wind<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.820> when<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.329> actually<00:03:43.480> release<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
the wind and when I actually release the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.090 
the wind and when I actually release the
forward<00:03:45.190> key<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.810> sales<00:03:47.140> go<00:03:47.290> up<00:03:47.320> now<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:47.980> is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
forward key the sales go up now this is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.039 
forward key the sales go up now this is
obviously<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.730> very<00:03:48.790> happy<00:03:49.329> way<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.600> doing<00:03:49.900> it

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
obviously a very happy way of doing it

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.920 
obviously a very happy way of doing it
all<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.230> did<00:03:50.470> is<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.940> raise<00:03:52.299> or<00:03:52.540> lower<00:03:52.570> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
all I did is just is raise or lower the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.229 
all I did is just is raise or lower the
colliders<00:03:53.739> on<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.010> bottom<00:03:54.370> which

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
colliders on the bottom which

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.410 
colliders on the bottom which
essentially<00:03:56.130> makes<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.370> cloth<00:03:57.640> go<00:03:58.060> up<00:03:58.239> and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
essentially makes the cloth go up and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.190 
essentially makes the cloth go up and
down<00:03:59.100> it's<00:04:00.100> not<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.579> proper<00:04:01.120> animation<00:04:01.450> by<00:04:02.049> all

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
down it's not a proper animation by all

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.170 
down it's not a proper animation by all
means<00:04:02.440> but<00:04:03.280> it's<00:04:03.790> better<00:04:04.060> than<00:04:04.269> nothing

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.610 

I've<00:04:09.180> also<00:04:09.360> been<00:04:09.570> experimenting<00:04:09.990> with<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
I've also been experimenting with the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.320 
I've also been experimenting with the
way<00:04:10.740> physics<00:04:11.220> works<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:14.240> ended<00:04:15.240> up

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
way physics works and I ended up

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.370 
way physics works and I ended up
reducing<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:17.270> physics<00:04:18.270> update<00:04:18.480> time<00:04:18.989> from

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
reducing the physics update time from

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.260 
reducing the physics update time from
every<00:04:19.860> 20<00:04:20.160> milliseconds<00:04:20.670> to<00:04:20.820> every<00:04:21.060> 10

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
every 20 milliseconds to every 10

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.420 
every 20 milliseconds to every 10
milliseconds<00:04:21.930> which<00:04:22.710> essentially<00:04:23.100> means

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
milliseconds which essentially means

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.870 
milliseconds which essentially means
that<00:04:23.550> there<00:04:24.540> are<00:04:24.690> 100<00:04:25.500> physics<00:04:25.830> updates<00:04:26.250> per

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
that there are 100 physics updates per

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.450 
that there are 100 physics updates per
second<00:04:27.300> what<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> notice<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.800> this<00:04:29.010> seems<00:04:29.280> to

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
second what I notice is this seems to

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.870 
second what I notice is this seems to
give<00:04:29.640> me<00:04:29.820> very<00:04:30.120> smooth<00:04:31.100> results<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.280> terms<00:04:32.580> of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
give me very smooth results in terms of

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.110 
give me very smooth results in terms of
frame<00:04:33.390> rate<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:35.070> all<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.430> issues<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.970> had

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
frame rate so all the issues that I had

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.670 
frame rate so all the issues that I had
with<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.390> jitter<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.780> whatnot<00:04:37.110> they're<00:04:37.500> not

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
with the jitter and whatnot they're not

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.300 
with the jitter and whatnot they're not
noticeable<00:04:38.280> if<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.960> use<00:04:39.960> 100<00:04:40.560> days<00:04:40.740> per<00:04:40.950> second

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
noticeable if I use 100 days per second

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.550 
noticeable if I use 100 days per second
I<00:04:41.490> guess<00:04:41.970> it's<00:04:42.150> because<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.750> higher<00:04:43.200> than

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
I guess it's because it's higher than

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.500 
I guess it's because it's higher than
the<00:04:43.770> number<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.130> frames<00:04:44.340> per<00:04:44.670> second<00:04:45.060> I'm<00:04:45.420> not

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
the number of frames per second I'm not

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.480 
the number of frames per second I'm not
sure<00:04:45.840> all<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.590> know<00:04:46.680> is<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.100> gives<00:04:47.370> me

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
sure all I know is this gives me

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.980 
sure all I know is this gives me
excellent<00:04:47.970> results<00:04:48.390> and<00:04:48.480> I'm<00:04:48.600> gonna<00:04:48.750> stick

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
excellent results and I'm gonna stick

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.470 
excellent results and I'm gonna stick
with<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.410> did<00:04:50.130> however<00:04:50.310> have<00:04:50.640> some<00:04:51.120> issues

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
with it I did however have some issues

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.240 
with it I did however have some issues
with<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.290> had<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.500> modify<00:04:52.860> at<00:04:53.100> one

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
with it that I had to modify at one

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.360 
with it that I had to modify at one
point<00:04:54.140> because<00:04:55.140> apparently<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.220> way

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
point because apparently the way

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.370 
point because apparently the way
friction<00:04:57.060> works<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.470> slightly<00:04:58.470> different<00:05:00.380> but

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
friction works is slightly different but

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.460 
friction works is slightly different but
I<00:05:02.240> believe<00:05:03.240> it's<00:05:03.420> highly<00:05:03.540> specific<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.320> what<00:05:04.440> I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
I believe it's highly specific to what I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.880 
I believe it's highly specific to what I
was<00:05:04.680> doing<00:05:04.980> so<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:05.490> not<00:05:05.640> gonna<00:05:05.790> get<00:05:05.970> into<00:05:06.150> that

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
was doing so I'm not gonna get into that

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.250 
was doing so I'm not gonna get into that
I'm<00:05:07.890> also<00:05:08.040> toyed<00:05:08.400> with<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.730> idea<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:09.260> having

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
I'm also toyed with the idea of having

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.610 
I'm also toyed with the idea of having
ship<00:05:10.680> be<00:05:11.010> moved<00:05:11.250> by<00:05:11.490> buoyancy<00:05:12.300> effects<00:05:12.630> rather

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
ship be moved by buoyancy effects rather

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.480 
ship be moved by buoyancy effects rather
than<00:05:13.980> by<00:05:14.850> using<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.560> strange<00:05:16.560> wheel<00:05:17.220> based

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
than by using a strange wheel based

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.210 
than by using a strange wheel based
approach<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.300> I<00:05:18.360> was<00:05:18.510> using<00:05:18.950> but<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.010> could

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
approach that I was using but I could

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.220 
approach that I was using but I could
never<00:05:20.430> get<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.510> quiet

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
never get it to be quiet

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.520 
never get it to be quiet
right<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:23.390> in<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:24.630> end<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:24.840> just<00:05:24.870> decided<00:05:25.410> to

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
right and in the end I just decided to

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.710 
right and in the end I just decided to
stick<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:25.860> what<00:05:26.160> I<00:05:26.190> got

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
stick with what I got

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.800 
stick with what I got
it<00:05:27.720> does<00:05:27.930> look<00:05:28.410> ok<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.120> if<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.330> look<00:05:30.540> closely

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
it does look ok but if you look closely

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.390 
it does look ok but if you look closely
you<00:05:31.140> will<00:05:31.260> notice<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:32.460> masts<00:05:33.000> end<00:05:33.240> up

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
you will notice that the masts end up

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.010 
you will notice that the masts end up
chittering<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.730> back<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.210> forth<00:05:36.450> essentially

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
chittering it back and forth essentially

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.820 
chittering it back and forth essentially
I<00:05:37.310> could<00:05:38.310> minimize<00:05:38.670> that<00:05:39.120> effect<00:05:39.480> by

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
I could minimize that effect by

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.970 
I could minimize that effect by
increasing<00:05:40.830> their<00:05:41.040> drag<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:43.410> particular

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
increasing their drag and particular

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.640 
increasing their drag and particular
angular<00:05:44.220> drag<00:05:44.610> but<00:05:44.910> I<00:05:45.200> could<00:05:46.200> never<00:05:46.290> get<00:05:46.530> it

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
angular drag but I could never get it

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.200 
angular drag but I could never get it
quite<00:05:46.800> right<00:05:46.860> and<00:05:47.340> after<00:05:47.670> playing<00:05:47.910> with<00:05:48.060> it

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
quite right and after playing with it

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.570 
quite right and after playing with it
for<00:05:48.390> about<00:05:48.450> an<00:05:48.690> hour<00:05:48.810> so<00:05:49.140> I<00:05:49.170> just<00:05:49.530> ended<00:05:50.490> up

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
for about an hour so I just ended up

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.030 
for about an hour so I just ended up
sticking<00:05:51.030> with<00:05:51.390> what<00:05:52.140> I<00:05:52.170> know<00:05:52.290> too<00:05:52.950> good<00:05:55.040> now

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
sticking with what I know too good now

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.800 
sticking with what I know too good now
that's<00:05:56.280> not<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.580> say<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:57.120> will<00:05:57.360> not<00:05:57.540> use

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
that's not to say that I will not use

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.980 
that's not to say that I will not use
buoyancy<00:05:58.500> effects<00:05:58.770> of<00:05:59.010> course<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.340> will<00:05:59.990> but

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
buoyancy effects of course I will but

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.510 
buoyancy effects of course I will but
it's<00:06:01.200> probably<00:06:01.410> not<00:06:01.650> gonna<00:06:01.770> be<00:06:01.950> for<00:06:02.220> ships

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
it's probably not gonna be for ships

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.700 
it's probably not gonna be for ships
maybe<00:06:03.360> for<00:06:03.600> things<00:06:03.810> floating<00:06:04.230> in<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.530> water

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
maybe for things floating in the water

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.879 
maybe for things floating in the water
it<00:06:05.010> makes<00:06:05.070> sense<00:06:05.580> like<00:06:06.030> barrels<00:06:06.450> or<00:06:06.860> logs

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
it makes sense like barrels or logs

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.779 
it makes sense like barrels or logs
we'll<00:06:09.849> see<00:06:11.280> lastly<00:06:12.280> I've<00:06:12.430> actually

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
we'll see lastly I've actually

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.790 
we'll see lastly I've actually
experimented<00:06:13.599> with<00:06:13.629> the<00:06:14.310> time<00:06:15.310> itself<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:16.800> in

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
experimented with the time itself and in

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.350 
experimented with the time itself and in
this<00:06:17.919> case<00:06:18.159> you<00:06:18.340> can<00:06:18.490> actually<00:06:18.639> see<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.150> ship

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
this case you can actually see the ship

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.420 
this case you can actually see the ship
moving<00:06:19.750> at<00:06:19.900> half<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.199> speed<00:06:20.710> because<00:06:21.400> the

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
moving at half the speed because the

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.610 
moving at half the speed because the
entire<00:06:21.789> world<00:06:22.090> is<00:06:22.389> slowed<00:06:22.659> down<00:06:22.900> to<00:06:23.229> 50

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
entire world is slowed down to 50

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.890 
entire world is slowed down to 50
percent<00:06:23.949> of<00:06:24.039> what<00:06:24.159> it<00:06:24.189> was<00:06:24.280> before<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.969> figure

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
percent of what it was before I figure

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.020 
percent of what it was before I figure
it<00:06:26.020> might<00:06:26.349> actually<00:06:26.560> be<00:06:26.800> a<00:06:26.979> good<00:06:27.370> idea<00:06:27.520> to<00:06:27.849> have

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
it might actually be a good idea to have

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.689 
it might actually be a good idea to have
this<00:06:28.240> kind<00:06:28.479> of<00:06:28.539> effect<00:06:28.719> for<00:06:29.139> a<00:06:29.169> combat<00:06:29.650> kind<00:06:30.639> of

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
this kind of effect for a combat kind of

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.300 
this kind of effect for a combat kind of
like<00:06:30.879> a<00:06:30.909> bullet<00:06:31.719> time<00:06:32.229> effect<00:06:32.789> but<00:06:33.789> for<00:06:33.819> ships

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
like a bullet time effect but for ships

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.770 
like a bullet time effect but for ships
this<00:06:36.310> might<00:06:36.639> give<00:06:36.879> players<00:06:37.830> more<00:06:39.780> fighting

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
this might give players more fighting

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.499 
this might give players more fighting
chance<00:06:41.050> in<00:06:41.379> combat<00:06:42.069> and<00:06:42.789> the<00:06:42.939> ability<00:06:43.360> to

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
chance in combat and the ability to
