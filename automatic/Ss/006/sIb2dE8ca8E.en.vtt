so<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.450> means<00:02:59.629> bible-thumping<00:03:00.440> Ned<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so that means bible-thumping Ned is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.240 
so that means bible-thumping Ned is
probably<00:03:01.670> close<00:03:02.000> behind<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:03.319> that's<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.890> so

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
probably close behind and that's it so

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.009

would just take checking Fat Tony but it

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.140 
would just take checking Fat Tony but it
doesn't<00:03:15.620> look<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:15.950> every<00:03:16.579> single<00:03:16.940> character

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
which is kind of a shame but in the end

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.869 
which is kind of a shame but in the end
it<00:03:22.760> doesn't<00:03:22.940> really<00:03:23.000> matter<00:03:23.299> either<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.049> hope

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
it doesn't really matter either so hope

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.309 
it doesn't really matter either so hope
just<00:03:25.879> easier<00:03:26.180> access<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.629> click<00:03:26.959> everybody
