00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.900
 we shared everything it's an interest 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.520
 common to this idea of ​​going out of 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.550
 rectangular format of the screen format 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 it's also a way of working 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.160
 not just the visual content but 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.869
 also the overall context in fact and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.109
 try to create an experience like that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.109
 which is immersive somehow 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 it is therefore the label anti targeted so 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.030
 it's a label that brings together a certain 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.829
 number of visual artists we all have 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.470
 started to do a little bit of our 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.750
 video projection by projecting on a 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.980
 screen behind a budget often in 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.280
 electronic music festivals 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.590
 have made installations 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.570
 in festivals and scenographies 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.219
 also for places we will make 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.640
 architectural projections so on 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.750
 buildings or inside buildings 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 there is the whole research and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.009
 development therefore due to creation of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.369
 software and all that work there from 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.159
 very technical research we will say the 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.420
 projects at the very beginning it was a bit 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.960
 the time when the moment we discovered the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.299
 mapping 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.250
 so we did not master the technique the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.830
 tools did not exist so from 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.690
 there had to use tools 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.910
 software that was suitable for for 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.710
 something else basically a big part 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.390
 of our work is very much related to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.979
 experimentation actually is what 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.929
 allowed us little by little to master 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.310
 this mapping technique with a video 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.429
 projector and a computer today 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.530
 we can send very precisely the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.090
 light a few steps on objects and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.220
 use the light projected the light 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.810
 reflected to finally changed the 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.940
 the environment around us is of a 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.649
 somehow a little modified the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.869
 real and or in any case the perception 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.550
 that we will have this idea of ​​going out 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.869
 of the screen as a friend said 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.000
 just now but I believe they 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.530
 also the idea of ​​coming out of contact of the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.570
 usual budget makes the context 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 also festive to invite people 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.229
 in places that are that are not a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:12.170
 priori of the performance venues of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:13.610
 show by one of the first projects 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.150
 me who marked me so it was in a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 cathedral 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.430
 habred of a holland which was therefore the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.900
 mapping of an organ of 20 meters 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.630
 up I believe with 2,300 pipes so of 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.579
 delors who had all the architecture 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.140
 so the inside of the cathedral has 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.180
 left map also we had added 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.500
 screens plus there was a room 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 so 20 minutes that was pretty 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.239
 long with someone who plays 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.859
 sheet music on the organ in the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.859
 Cathedral at the same time as the videos 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.310
 these places it offers both what we 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.300
 needs ie darkness and a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 huge volume and a fair dimension 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.900
 with a light work of light already he 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.310
 there was an incredible effect in these 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.340
 places it's a project called 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.290
 songdo that was done in south korea 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.500
 so in August 2009 so to go do 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.450
 their medium mapping projects 2-0 at 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.460
 project on the spot and so we left 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.590
 three weeks practically on the spot 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.810
 to say everything that technically we had to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.300
 create a 3d model and the idea was no 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.030
 more than broadcast content on the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.470
 facade but change the perception that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.210
 people were going to have its structure 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.210
 which was pretty incredible in this 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.790
 project there was that this building does 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.650
 part of a city under construction on 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.500
 a breakthrough in the sea a city of 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.030
 future decibels tomorrow stood there but 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.890
 a trick that's pretty interesting too 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.750
 that's where we realize 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.340
 the importance of context on how 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.950
 which we will develop a room a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.450
 context that is pretty surreal it's 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.459
 to say to a few buildings we could see 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.870
 the ground tracks of the future city that 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.730
 did not exist yet and if not all the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.810
 rest are truck cranes who 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.580
 builds buildings skeletons 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.350
 buildings is that there is a side a 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.060
 little 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.380
 almost a little post apocalyptic ago 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.640
 something quite violent enough 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 anyway I find in this in this 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200
 context the defense side yes that's the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.080
 side in situ is still pretty 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.750
 primordial in denjean of work the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.970
 the purpose of all this is to 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.440
 make the technology tice too sharp 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.790
 it can be for her to be 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.260
 invisible and that they allow 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.230
 finally people to find themselves 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.570
 in front of a visual experience that is 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.050
 which is strong but really keep 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.520
 the the human side in the foreground in 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.629
 la France 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.460
 we will perform 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.240
 audiovisuals so like cabbage with 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.240
 markov 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.569
 lynn franco 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.319
 miley cyrus 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.319
 m 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:19.580
 evry Nexio parisse of 6 million 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:23.850
 fake graphics cards 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:36.080
 we left a sad music rlm if the 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:36.080
 move it my soul to soul its inhabitants 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.630
 natixis am 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.630
 johnny hallyday but if we are 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.630
 different 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.280
 something about a collaboration of twins 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.020
 all develop instead of all 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.170
 student backgrounds produce life 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:41.740
 yellow will be at montceau programming 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.740
 gives itself sawyer technology s 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.780
 already four times for all
