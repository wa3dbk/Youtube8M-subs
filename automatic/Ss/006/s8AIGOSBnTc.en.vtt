00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.109

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
seeing Winky Wright fighting Taylor I

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.970 
seeing Winky Wright fighting Taylor I
don't<00:03:36.260> know<00:03:36.349> if<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.500> guys<00:03:36.620> remember<00:03:36.680> that

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
don't know if you guys remember that

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.940 
don't know if you guys remember that
fight<00:03:37.310> where<00:03:38.260> even<00:03:39.260> though<00:03:39.349> I<00:03:39.380> think<00:03:39.769> that's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
fight where even though I think that's

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.520 
fight where even though I think that's
like<00:03:40.160> wiki<00:03:40.880> white<00:03:41.180> one<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.049> thing<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.230> he

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
like wiki white one but the thing is he

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.440 
like wiki white one but the thing is he
to<00:03:42.680> stay<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:42.980> much<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.549> a<00:03:43.609> defensive<00:03:43.790> mode<00:03:44.239> I

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
to stay so much in a defensive mode I

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.879 
to stay so much in a defensive mode I
think<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.900> kind<00:03:45.079> of<00:03:45.169> hurts<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.500> little<00:03:45.709> bit

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
think that kind of hurts a little bit

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.750 
think that kind of hurts a little bit
because<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.940> makes<00:03:47.630> Josh<00:03:48.049> McLaury<00:03:48.650> looks<00:03:49.190> look

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
because it makes Josh McLaury looks look

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.089 
because it makes Josh McLaury looks look
like<00:03:50.120> he's<00:03:50.450> kind<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.780> shy<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.410> turns<00:03:51.650> when<00:03:51.919> in

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
like he's kind of shy and turns when in

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.849 
like he's kind of shy and turns when in
terms<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.489> throwing<00:03:52.790> punches<00:03:53.530> I'm<00:03:54.530> not<00:03:54.680> saying

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
terms of throwing punches I'm not saying

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.830 
terms of throwing punches I'm not saying
he's<00:03:55.040> scared<00:03:55.340> from<00:03:55.579> when<00:03:55.790> she<00:03:55.819> just<00:03:56.000> looks<00:03:56.510> he

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
he's scared from when she just looks he

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.839 
he's scared from when she just looks he
doesn't<00:03:57.169> throw<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:58.040> amount<00:03:58.340> of<00:03:58.430> punches<00:03:58.760> you

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
doesn't throw the amount of punches you

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.789 
doesn't throw the amount of punches you
need<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.120> throw<00:03:59.359> in<00:03:59.599> a<00:03:59.810> fight<00:04:00.049> he's<00:04:00.290> always<00:04:00.739> on

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
need to throw in a fight he's always on

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.740 
need to throw in a fight he's always on
that<00:04:00.980> defensive<00:04:01.519> mode<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.269> that's<00:04:02.510> why<00:04:02.720> i

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
that defensive mode so that's why i

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.140 
that defensive mode so that's why i
think<00:04:03.109> i<00:04:03.319> think<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.919> uh<00:04:03.950> Cotto<00:04:04.639> just<00:04:05.030> by

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
think i think that uh Cotto just by

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.059 
think i think that uh Cotto just by
throwing<00:04:05.329> punches<00:04:05.690> moving<00:04:06.590> around<00:04:06.829> and

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
throwing punches moving around and

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.539 
throwing punches moving around and
boxing<00:04:07.760> he<00:04:08.180> could<00:04:08.359> probably<00:04:08.599> win<00:04:09.019> a<00:04:09.549> 12-round

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549

out I think that can happen i think kuti

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.510 
out I think that can happen i think kuti
can<00:04:35.150> not<00:04:35.480> co2<00:04:35.750> out<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:37.010> would<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.400> an

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
can not co2 out so it would be an

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.100 
can not co2 out so it would be an
interesting<00:04:37.640> fight<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.600> would<00:04:38.690> be<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.900> real

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
interesting fight it would be a real

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.420 
interesting fight it would be a real
good<00:04:39.140> fight<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:42.020> lot<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.170> boxing<00:04:42.710> fans

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430

won't<00:04:43.610> see<00:04:43.880> that<00:04:44.060> is<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> smart<00:04:45.830> move<00:04:46.010> a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
won't see that is it a smart move a

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.280 
won't see that is it a smart move a
smart<00:04:46.940> move<00:04:47.330> i<00:04:47.510> don't<00:04:47.660> think<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:47.930> i<00:04:48.230> think

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
smart move i don't think so i think

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.020 
smart move i don't think so i think
would<00:04:48.620> be<00:04:48.770> better<00:04:48.920> for<00:04:49.010> him<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.280> fight<00:04:49.520> mosley

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
would be better for him to fight mosley

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.570 
would be better for him to fight mosley
knowing<00:04:50.900> he<00:04:51.020> already<00:04:51.260> beat<00:04:51.530> him<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:52.160> would<00:04:52.400> be

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
knowing he already beat him it would be

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.610 
knowing he already beat him it would be
it<00:04:52.850> would<00:04:52.880> be<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> big<00:04:53.420> money<00:04:53.690> fight<00:04:53.960> because

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
it would be a big money fight because

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.860 
it would be a big money fight because
mostly<00:04:55.130> is<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.310> big<00:04:55.550> name<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.060> he<00:04:56.390> just<00:04:56.630> came

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
mostly is a big name and he just came

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.260 
mostly is a big name and he just came
off<00:04:57.080> being<00:04:57.320> wrong<00:04:57.620> reto<00:04:57.890> so<00:04:58.610> would<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:59.000> bigger

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
off being wrong reto so would be bigger

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.470 
off being wrong reto so would be bigger
so<00:04:59.540> I<00:05:00.020> would<00:05:00.440> look<00:05:00.620> more<00:05:00.920> in<00:05:01.730> terms<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.270> fight

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
so I would look more in terms of fight

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.360 
so I would look more in terms of fight
mosley<00:05:02.750> includi<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:03.650> if<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.830> thought<00:05:04.070> Cody

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
mosley includi but if you thought Cody

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.910 
mosley includi but if you thought Cody
it'd<00:05:04.640> still<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.270> good<00:05:05.480> fight<00:05:05.690> like<00:05:06.590> i<00:05:06.740> said

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
it'd still be a good fight like i said

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.650 
it'd still be a good fight like i said
my<00:05:07.070> prediction<00:05:07.580> on<00:05:07.670> that<00:05:07.730> fight<00:05:08.060> it's<00:05:08.450> just

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
my prediction on that fight it's just

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.450 
my prediction on that fight it's just
too<00:05:08.840> difficult<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.380> say<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.800> it's<00:05:09.890> a<00:05:10.280> real

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
too difficult to say is it's a real

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.460 
too difficult to say is it's a real
difficult<00:05:10.820> fight<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.420> know<00:05:11.570> I'm<00:05:11.990> not<00:05:12.140> good<00:05:12.320> I

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
difficult fight you know I'm not good I

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.410 
difficult fight you know I'm not good I
don't<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:12.710> if<00:05:13.400> there's<00:05:14.030> going<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.270> be<00:05:14.300> a

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
don't think if there's going to be a

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.630 
don't think if there's going to be a
knockout<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.050> think<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.440> would<00:05:15.530> be<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.740> Kuti<00:05:16.160> 19

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
knockout I think it would be the Kuti 19

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.810 
knockout I think it would be the Kuti 19
code<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.060> lot<00:05:17.300> that's<00:05:18.140> why<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.380> see<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.740> if<00:05:19.520> it

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
code a lot that's why I see it if it

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.150 
code a lot that's why I see it if it
would<00:05:19.940> be<00:05:20.270> a<00:05:20.300> 12-round<00:05:20.900> decision<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.620> would

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
would be a 12-round decision I would

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.570 
would be a 12-round decision I would
lean<00:05:22.400> towards<00:05:23.300> Cotto<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.950> it's<00:05:25.220> going<00:05:25.340> to<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.550> a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
lean towards Cotto so it's going to be a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.310 
lean towards Cotto so it's going to be a
