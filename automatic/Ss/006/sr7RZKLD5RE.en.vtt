we the thing is they're trying to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
we the thing is they're trying to
predict<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.900> fucking<00:01:25.409> future<00:01:25.770> warfare<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that and i'm making a prediction myself

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
that and i'm making a prediction myself
and<00:01:30.930> i<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.820> reason<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and i know it's just not the reason a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.330 
and i know it's just not the reason a
lot<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> people<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.290> because

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
lot of people don't like it is because

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.249 
lot of people don't like it is because
there's<00:01:35.340> nothing<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.060> relate<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
there's nothing we can relate to in it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.789 
there's nothing we can relate to in it
it's<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.710> bull<00:01:38.130> shit<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:39.360> fucking
