can and then spend some more time to get

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.860 
can and then spend some more time to get
the<00:05:32.400> quality<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.060> movement<00:05:33.300> up<00:05:33.570> little

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the quality of the movement up little

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.460 
the quality of the movement up little
bit<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.740> it<00:05:35.040> not<00:05:35.340> doing<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.840> movement<00:05:37.260> right

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
bit if it not doing the movement right

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.710 
bit if it not doing the movement right
and<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.740> fit<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.160> not<00:05:38.310> strong<00:05:38.670> enough<00:05:38.720> you

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
and you fit it not strong enough you

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.870 
and you fit it not strong enough you
will<00:05:39.900> find<00:05:40.170> very<00:05:40.410> difficult<00:05:40.650> to<00:05:41.100> apply<00:05:41.520> them

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
will find very difficult to apply them

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.840 
will find very difficult to apply them
into<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.300> application<00:05:42.980> so<00:05:43.980> make<00:05:44.190> sure<00:05:44.220> the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
into the application so make sure the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.000 
into the application so make sure the
foundation<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.720> do<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:46.290> got<00:05:46.710> be<00:05:46.830> done

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
foundation you do is got be done

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.930 
foundation you do is got be done
properly<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:48.470> okay<00:05:49.470> now<00:05:50.040> if<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.460> are<00:05:50.610> start

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
properly to it okay now if you are start

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.080 
properly to it okay now if you are start
to<00:05:51.720> understanding<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.590> basic<00:05:53.040> now<00:05:53.220> let<00:05:53.940> me

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
to understanding the basic now let me

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.120 
to understanding the basic now let me
show<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.360> here<00:05:54.660> how<00:05:54.930> exactly<00:05:55.530> it's<00:05:55.740> done<00:05:55.920> in

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
show you here how exactly it's done in

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.310 
show you here how exactly it's done in
normal<00:05:56.400> speed<00:05:56.790> so<00:05:57.540> when<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:57.870> start<00:05:58.140> to

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
normal speed so when you start to

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.560 
normal speed so when you start to
practice<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:59.010> can<00:05:59.190> see<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.550> idea<00:06:00.000> how<00:06:00.360> it

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
practice you can see the idea how it

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.170 
practice you can see the idea how it
come<00:06:00.750> out<00:06:00.900> will<00:06:01.650> be<00:06:01.800> look<00:06:01.950> like<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.370> recommend

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
come out will be look like I recommend

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.830 
come out will be look like I recommend
on<00:06:03.270> this<00:06:03.420> part

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
on this part

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.290 
on this part
watch<00:06:04.320> me<00:06:04.590> how<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.800> do<00:06:04.950> them<00:06:05.250> first<00:06:05.460> so<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.180> can

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
watch me how I do them first so you can

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.800 
watch me how I do them first so you can
see<00:06:06.480> how<00:06:07.170> you<00:06:07.560> do<00:06:07.740> them<00:06:07.920> later<00:06:08.070> now<00:06:08.720> when<00:06:09.720> you

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
see how you do them later now when you

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.060 
see how you do them later now when you
start<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.550> same<00:06:11.550> thing<00:06:11.580> fit<00:06:12.030> out<00:06:12.150> like<00:06:12.330> this

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
start to same thing fit out like this

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.760 
start to same thing fit out like this
nicely<00:06:14.070> coming<00:06:14.370> out<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.990> remember<00:06:15.990> what<00:06:16.470> need

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
nicely coming out and remember what need
