00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.289
# As rumor has it still #

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.329
# I followed the rules
of Frank and McNeal #

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.100
# So catch me if you can,
there ain't people when I take off #

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.806
# Check me when I land,
white-collar mischief #

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.962
# Never been caught,
so if money's on your mind #

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.360
# Nigga, hold that thought #

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.166
# Daydreaming of a mil,
but plottin' the same fortune #

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.766
# I think, "Make it rain,"
or maybe I'm brainstorming" #

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.300
# Young gettin' busy on his own
like an orphan #

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.051
# My sentence-skillful ways
equal self-made endorsements #

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.811
# Damn, Mr. Commodity,
you are such a lottery ticket #

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.440
# Making these rappers
seem sorry, apologies #

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.126
# Somebody gotta do it,
I guess it's gonna be moi #

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.806
# I'm in a foreign Maserati,
please say au revoir #

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.446
# Yeah, life's a bitch,
Money made it up #

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.046
# Every now and then I like to
cheat on her with Lady Luck #

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.770
# Push come to shove #
# Come to shove #

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.086
# Push back #
# Push back #

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.969
# Tell them I ain't going
out like that #

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.880
# When push come to shove #
# Come to shove #

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.331
# Push back #
# Push back #

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.130
# We ain't gotta take that,
homie, homie #

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.410
# Get down #
# Get down #

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.681
# Get down, homie, homie #

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.800
# Get down #
# Get down #

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.008
# Feet on pavement,
grind time blisters #

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.640
# Entertaining the idea
that I can get richer #

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.036
# Corrupt moves,
can't explain it all like Clarissa #

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.846
# But it's a reason
for my motives I deliver #

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.606
# Gucci bag straps
is becoming my enigma #

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.525
# I'm too old for swag,
I'm focused on my charisma #

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.729
# Saying, "Yo, why you talking
like them white folks?" #

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.526
# I say, "I'm just shaking hands
with the right folks" #

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.047
# Clocking overtime
with the same clothes #

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.646
# What time you off work?
When the bank close #

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.286
# I dated females with issues
that I'm to blame for #

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.841
# I've fallen victim to the emotions
that I ain't show #

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.128
# Close knitted to
the cost of success #

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.931
# Some call it being confident,
I call it being blessed #

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.300
# Just a minute,
let me get it off my chest #

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.524
# See, I'm coming for what's next,
y'all niggas can have the rest, wait #

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.250
# When push come to shove #
# Come to shove #

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.480
# Push back #
# Push back #

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.364
# Tell them
you ain't going out like that #

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.501
# When push come to shove #
# Come to shove #

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.841
# Push back #
# Push back #

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.680
# You ain't gotta take that,
homie, homie #

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.566
# Get down #
# Get down #

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.051
# Get down,
homie, homie #

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.966
# Get down #
# Get down #

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.600
