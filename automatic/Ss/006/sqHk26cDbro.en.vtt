afford<00:01:54.450> any<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> amp<00:01:55.350> set<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> market

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
afford any of the amp set on the market

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
afford any of the amp set on the market
so<00:01:56.700> he<00:01:56.820> had<00:01:56.909> taken<00:01:57.060> some<00:01:57.240> soldering<00:01:57.659> classes

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so he had taken some soldering classes

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
so he had taken some soldering classes
and<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.380> currently<00:01:58.590> an<00:01:58.890> electrical<00:01:59.369> engineer

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and was currently an electrical engineer

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
and was currently an electrical engineer
student<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.630> he<00:02:00.719> decided<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
student so he decided you know what I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
student so he decided you know what I
could<00:02:02.250> take<00:02:02.399> these<00:02:02.520> plans<00:02:02.850> off<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> internet

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
could take these plans off the internet

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.940 
could take these plans off the internet
and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:03.960> my<00:02:04.140> own<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.829> he

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and I can make my own so that's what he

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
and I can make my own so that's what he
did<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.219> made<00:02:05.579> himself<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.360> crude

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
did he made himself a very crude

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
did he made himself a very crude
homemade<00:02:07.560> amplifier<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.550> his<00:02:08.700> headphones

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
homemade amplifier for his headphones

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.750 
homemade amplifier for his headphones
and<00:02:09.530> then<00:02:10.530> he<00:02:10.649> found<00:02:10.800> himself<00:02:10.920> needing<00:02:11.459> some

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and then he found himself needing some

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
and then he found himself needing some
money<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.540> he<00:02:12.810> sold

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
money so he sold

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
money so he sold
his<00:02:13.590> beloved<00:02:14.040> homemade<00:02:14.670> amplifier<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.420> eBay

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
his beloved homemade amplifier on eBay

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.200 
his beloved homemade amplifier on eBay
and<00:02:16.110> made<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> few<00:02:16.920> bucks<00:02:17.160> above<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:17.970> cost

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
and made a few bucks above what it cost

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.720 
and made a few bucks above what it cost
him<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.690> make<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.830> he<00:02:20.160> found<00:02:20.520> himself

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
him to make that so he found himself

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
him to make that so he found himself
later<00:02:21.150> again<00:02:21.450> needing<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:21.990> amplifier<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.040> he

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
later again needing an amplifier so he

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
later again needing an amplifier so he
made<00:02:23.460> another<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.270> once<00:02:24.660> again<00:02:24.960> he<00:02:25.170> sold

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
made another one and once again he sold

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
made another one and once again he sold
it<00:02:25.650> but<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.070> time<00:02:26.340> he<00:02:26.490> was<00:02:26.580> able<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.880> get<00:02:27.000> more

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it but this time he was able to get more

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.300 
it but this time he was able to get more
money<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.170> then<00:02:28.710> took<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:28.980> money

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
money for it and then took that money

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.390 
money for it and then took that money
and<00:02:29.490> made<00:02:29.820> more<00:02:30.180> amplifiers<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.340> created<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and made more amplifiers and created a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.650 
and made more amplifiers and created a
little<00:02:32.640> bit<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> supply<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.180> demand<00:02:33.270> for

I<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.370> have<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.670> upgraded<00:03:48.060> aluminum<00:03:48.300> knob<00:03:48.690> on

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
I do have the upgraded aluminum knob on

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.690 
I do have the upgraded aluminum knob on
here<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.590> has<00:03:49.770> gone<00:03:50.040> suit<00:03:50.310> through<00:03:50.520> some

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
here and this has gone suit through some

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.760 
here and this has gone suit through some
revisions<00:03:51.180> so<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> little<00:03:52.620> bit

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
revisions so this is a little bit

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.320 
revisions so this is a little bit
different<00:03:53.100> than<00:03:53.250> what<00:03:53.430> some<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.060> older

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
different than what some of the older

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.630 
different than what some of the older
ones<00:03:54.450> are<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.080> instance<00:03:55.410> now<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.680> power

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
ones are like for instance now the power

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.220 
ones are like for instance now the power
plug<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.390> back<00:03:57.570> instead<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.170> front

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
you have your output you can also choose

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.760 
you have your output you can also choose

very heavy-duty sticky rubber feet this

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.090 
very heavy-duty sticky rubber feet this
thing<00:04:29.360> does<00:04:29.540> not<00:04:29.570> slide<00:04:30.290> on<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.590> desk<00:04:30.830> it's

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
thing does not slide on the desk it's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.450 
thing does not slide on the desk it's
actually<00:04:31.520> very<00:04:31.790> very<00:04:31.940> stuck<00:04:33.340> short<00:04:34.340> of

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
actually very very stuck short of

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.830 
actually very very stuck short of
putting<00:04:34.580> double-sided<00:04:35.120> sticky<00:04:35.420> tape<00:04:35.570> on

putting double-sided sticky tape on
there<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.170> don't<00:04:36.230> think<00:04:36.500> it<00:04:36.620> could<00:04:36.770> actually

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
there I don't think it could actually

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.710 
there I don't think it could actually
get<00:04:37.310> any<00:04:37.490> more<00:04:37.730> traction<00:04:38.090> on<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.480> desk

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
get any more traction on the desk

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.340 
get any more traction on the desk
without<00:04:38.960> moving<00:04:39.560> now<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.760> thing<00:04:41.350> actually

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
without moving now this thing actually

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.470 
without moving now this thing actually
puts<00:04:42.590> out<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.950> lot<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.370> power<00:04:43.670> now<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.120> reason

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
puts out a lot of power now the reason

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.360 
puts out a lot of power now the reason
why<00:04:44.600> I<00:04:44.630> needed<00:04:45.140> this<00:04:45.380> was<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.920> guys<00:04:46.070> know

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
why I needed this was as you guys know

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.820 
why I needed this was as you guys know

they have very high resistance and very
power<00:04:53.990> hungry<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.830> they<00:04:55.010> needed<00:04:55.250> an<00:04:55.490> amplifier

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000

just<00:07:03.259> kind<00:07:03.439> of<00:07:03.589> let<00:07:03.919> that<00:07:04.069> one<00:07:04.279> slide<00:07:04.579> because

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
just kind of let that one slide because

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.059 
just kind of let that one slide because
you<00:07:05.089> can't<00:07:05.389> see<00:07:05.719> it<00:07:05.799> but<00:07:06.799> this<00:07:07.009> does

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:07.069 
you can't see it but this does

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.239 
you can't see it but this does
everything<00:07:08.029> I<00:07:08.149> needed<00:07:08.419> and<00:07:08.629> more<00:07:09.229> so<00:07:09.769> if<00:07:10.069> you

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:10.249 
everything I needed and more so if you

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:12.909 
everything I needed and more so if you
are<00:07:10.489> looking<00:07:10.939> for<00:07:11.329> a<00:07:11.689> no<00:07:12.050> DAC<00:07:12.289> or<00:07:12.589> even<00:07:12.800> a

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
are looking for a no DAC or even a

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.949 
are looking for a no DAC or even a
headphone<00:07:13.309> amplifier<00:07:13.879> definitely<00:07:14.599> consider

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:14.959 
headphone amplifier definitely consider

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.600 
headphone amplifier definitely consider
this<00:07:15.019> not<00:07:15.349> get<00:07:15.469> any<00:07:15.619> kickback<00:07:16.009> I<00:07:16.039> wasn't<00:07:16.489> paid

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
this not get any kickback I wasn't paid

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.609 
this not get any kickback I wasn't paid
to<00:07:16.639> say<00:07:16.849> that<00:07:16.879> this<00:07:17.300> is<00:07:17.449> 100%<00:07:17.869> in<00:07:18.139> my<00:07:18.199> opinion

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:18.619 
to say that this is 100% in my opinion

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.699 
to say that this is 100% in my opinion
this<00:07:19.069> is<00:07:19.129> an<00:07:19.369> amazing<00:07:19.909> amplifier<00:07:20.419> for<00:07:21.139> for<00:07:21.619> the

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:21.709 
this is an amazing amplifier for for the

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:23.589 
this is an amazing amplifier for for the
cost<00:07:21.919> and<00:07:22.309> that's<00:07:22.579> the<00:07:22.759> reason<00:07:22.969> why<00:07:23.059> Jerry<00:07:23.360> has

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 
cost and that's the reason why Jerry has

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:25.319 
cost and that's the reason why Jerry has
it<00:07:23.749> because<00:07:23.959> as<00:07:24.079> you<00:07:24.110> know<00:07:24.349> he's<00:07:24.559> poor<00:07:24.800> people
