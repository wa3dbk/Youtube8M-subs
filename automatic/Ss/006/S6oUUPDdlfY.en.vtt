hi<00:00:00.870> everyone<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.500> today<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.820> decided<00:00:03.389> that

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi everyone so today I just decided that

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.039 
hi everyone so today I just decided that
I<00:00:03.750> wanted<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.170> do<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:05.000> overview<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.720> loft

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
I wanted to do a overview of the loft

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.860 
I wanted to do a overview of the loft
because<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.680> couple<00:00:07.890> people<00:00:08.099> asked<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.490> that

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
because a couple people asked for that

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.089 
because a couple people asked for that
showing<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.650> little<00:00:10.769> bit<00:00:10.950> more

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
showing it to you in a little bit more

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.020 
showing it to you in a little bit more
detail<00:00:11.550> than<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.030> my<00:00:12.240> cage<00:00:12.480> tour<00:00:13.160> so<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
detail than I did in my cage tour so to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390 
detail than I did in my cage tour so to
start<00:00:15.240> off<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.809> figured<00:00:16.199> I'll<00:00:16.590> give<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.890> some

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
start off I figured I'll give you some

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.470 
start off I figured I'll give you some
of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> measurements<00:00:18.029> because<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.240> lot<00:00:18.449> of

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of the measurements because a lot of

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.510 
of the measurements because a lot of
people<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.990> asked<00:00:19.289> me<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.100> know<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
people have asked me that and I know in

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920 
people have asked me that and I know in
my<00:00:20.580> case<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.970> was<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.480> bit<00:00:21.570> sketchy<00:00:21.810> on

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
my case I was a little bit sketchy on

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.759 
my case I was a little bit sketchy on
the<00:00:21.990> measurements<00:00:22.380> because<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.590> really

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the measurements because I really

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.439 
the measurements because I really
couldn't<00:00:22.859> remember<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.519> I'm<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> start

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
couldn't remember so I'm going to start

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.339 
couldn't remember so I'm going to start
with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> ramp<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.070> 22<00:00:27.029> inches<00:00:27.480> long<00:00:27.720> by

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
with the ramp it is 22 inches long by

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.359 
with the ramp it is 22 inches long by
seven<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> half<00:00:29.070> wide<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.189> see

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
seven and a half wide and so you can see

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
seven and a half wide and so you can see
where<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.550> overlap<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> grid<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.440> like

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
where I overlap the grid this is like

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.970 
where I overlap the grid this is like
the<00:00:35.070> big<00:00:35.370> squared<00:00:36.300> grids<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.380> pack<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.770> grids

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the big squared grids the pack of grids

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
the big squared grids the pack of grids
that<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.399> had<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:39.450> ones<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.320> if

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that I got had little ones like this if

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
that I got had little ones like this if
you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> tell<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.520> sure<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> can

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
you can tell not really sure if you can

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
you can tell not really sure if you can
and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.629> bigger<00:00:43.020> squared<00:00:43.379> ones<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and then it had bigger squared ones so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.389 
and then it had bigger squared ones so
use<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> bigger<00:00:44.610> square<00:00:45.030> ones<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> ramp

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
use the bigger square ones for the ramp

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.110 
use the bigger square ones for the ramp
and<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.550> overlap<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.270> by<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and I overlap them by two of this and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
and I overlap them by two of this and
then<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.329> zip<00:00:51.570> tied<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> together<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.699> for

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
then I zip tied it together and then for

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.520 
then I zip tied it together and then for
the<00:00:54.360> main<00:00:54.539> part<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> loft

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the main part of the loft

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
the main part of the loft
it<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.660> 14<00:00:57.660> inches<00:00:58.530> wide<00:00:58.590> by<00:00:59.280> 22<00:01:00.000> long<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it is 14 inches wide by 22 long and this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
it is 14 inches wide by 22 long and this
part<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.270> from<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.960> part<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
part here from the top of this part to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
part here from the top of this part to
the<00:01:04.739> floor<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.519> 11<00:01:06.479> inches<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the floor is 11 inches and then it is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
the floor is 11 inches and then it is
also<00:01:07.710> 11<00:01:08.100> inches<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
also 11 inches from here to here and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
also 11 inches from here to here and
then<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.619> front<00:01:11.040> wall<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
then this little front wall part which I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.399 
then this little front wall part which I
trimmed<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> little<00:01:13.290> bit

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
trimmed so it would be a little bit

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.630 
trimmed so it would be a little bit
lower<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.890> didn't<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> full

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
lower because I didn't want it the full

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
lower because I didn't want it the full
height<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:16.350> seven<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> half

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
height of this is also seven and a half

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.580 
height of this is also seven and a half
inches<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.930> those<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
inches so those are just the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.359 
inches so those are just the
measurements<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:21.780> took<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> floor<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.159> so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
measurements and I took the floor out so

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
measurements and I took the floor out so
you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.700> maybe<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:23.970> where<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> grids<00:01:24.630> are

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you can maybe see where the grids are

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050 
you can maybe see where the grids are
also<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> overlapped<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.729> are<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> big

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
also I overlapped these are the big

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
also I overlapped these are the big
square<00:01:27.330> ones<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.140> overlapped<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
square ones as well I overlapped two of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.140 
square ones as well I overlapped two of
the<00:01:29.820> squares<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.950> three<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.909> little

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the squares here three of the little

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.950 
the squares here three of the little
squares<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.540> for<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> bottom

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
squares here and then for the bottom

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
squares here and then for the bottom
part<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> big<00:01:38.130> ones<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.479> overlapped

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
part I use the big ones and I overlapped

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.969 
part I use the big ones and I overlapped
-<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.250> basically<00:01:41.990> everywhere<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> big

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
- so basically everywhere I use the big

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.700 
- so basically everywhere I use the big
grids<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.520> overlapped<00:01:44.939> two<00:01:45.509> squares<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> then

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
grids I overlapped two squares and then

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
grids I overlapped two squares and then
everywhere<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.130> used<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.909> ones<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
everywhere I used the little ones I

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
everywhere I used the little ones I
overlapped<00:01:48.750> three<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.740> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
overlapped three and then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.459 
overlapped three and then
same<00:01:50.340> goes<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.380> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
overlapped three really sorry if it's a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.460 
overlapped three really sorry if it's a
little<00:02:02.310> difficult<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.179> I<00:02:03.450> tried<00:02:04.229> using

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
little difficult to see I tried using

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.139 
little difficult to see I tried using
somewhat<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.250> solid<00:02:05.579> background<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
somewhat of a solid background so you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.710 
somewhat of a solid background so you
can<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.600> everything<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.209> again<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
can see everything and then again like I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.020 
can see everything and then again like I
showed<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.019> my<00:02:10.050> page<00:02:10.319> tour<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> ramp<00:02:11.280> detaches

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
showed in my page tour the ramp detaches

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.150 
showed in my page tour the ramp detaches
and<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.870> these<00:02:13.019> corner<00:02:13.410> brackets<00:02:13.830> they

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
and I use these corner brackets they

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160 
and I use these corner brackets they
used<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.580> come<00:02:14.819> out<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.269> all<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.810> way<00:02:15.930> out

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
used to come out like all the way out

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
used to come out like all the way out
here<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.099> then<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.370> trim<00:02:17.670> them<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.269> they'd<00:02:18.390> be

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
here but then we trim them so they'd be

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.120 
here but then we trim them so they'd be
a<00:02:18.599> little<00:02:18.840> bit<00:02:18.959> shorter<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.849> got<00:02:21.780> one

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
a little bit shorter and it just got one

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.190 
a little bit shorter and it just got one
right<00:02:23.130> there<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:24.269> really<00:02:24.420> sure<00:02:24.660> how<00:02:24.840> many<00:02:24.900> zip

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
right there not really sure how many zip

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.100

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
ties I used I know I use more than 50

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.110

because I bought two packs of 50 and I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.289 
because I bought two packs of 50 and I

don't<00:03:36.329> pair<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.470> figured<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.040> doesn't

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
don't pair so I figured it doesn't

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.280 
don't pair so I figured it doesn't
really<00:03:38.310> matter<00:03:38.489> if<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.480> could<00:03:39.750> find<00:03:39.989> like<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
really matter if I could find like a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.590 
really matter if I could find like a
very<00:03:40.560> large<00:03:40.829> sheet<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.160> coroplast<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:42.060> probably

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
very large sheet of coroplast I probably

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.840 
very large sheet of coroplast I probably
would<00:03:42.840> get<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:43.500> cut<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.220> bend

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
would get that and then cut it and bend

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.940 
would get that and then cut it and bend
it<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> sides<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.750> make<00:03:45.930> sides<00:03:46.230> because

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
it on the sides to make sides because

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.129 
it on the sides to make sides because
the<00:03:47.069> hay<00:03:47.280> does<00:03:47.700> fall<00:03:48.090> out<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.359> lot<00:03:48.780> because<00:03:48.930> I

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
the hay does fall out a lot because I

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.140 
the hay does fall out a lot because I
don't<00:03:49.170> have<00:03:49.380> any<00:03:49.560> sides<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.670> maybe<00:03:50.849> that<00:03:51.060> will

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
don't have any sides so maybe that will

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.420 
don't have any sides so maybe that will
be<00:03:51.269> something<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.780> will<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.109> future<00:03:52.430> now

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
be something I will do in the future now

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.970 
be something I will do in the future now
as<00:03:54.239> far<00:03:54.510> as<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.720> ramp<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.170> concerned<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.889> what

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
as far as the ramp is concerned and what

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.099 
as far as the ramp is concerned and what
it's<00:03:56.160> made<00:03:56.370> out<00:03:56.430> of<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:57.090> lot<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.690> people<00:03:57.989> I've

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
it's made out of a lot of people I've

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.920 
it's made out of a lot of people I've
heard<00:03:58.500> say<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.639> ramp<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.660> they've

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
heard say that the ramp that they've

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.080 
heard say that the ramp that they've
made<00:04:01.229> out<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.530> wood<00:04:01.769> will<00:04:02.310> start<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.669> smell<00:04:02.940> bad

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
made out of wood will start to smell bad

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.890 
made out of wood will start to smell bad
because<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.509> pigs

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
because the pigs

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750 
because the pigs
he<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.379> but<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.680> really<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.189> not<00:04:05.459> noticed

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
he on it but I really have not noticed

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.149 
he on it but I really have not noticed
that<00:04:06.120> they<00:04:06.239> pee<00:04:06.510> on<00:04:06.689> it<00:04:06.840> too<00:04:06.989> much<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:07.379> maybe

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
that they pee on it too much like maybe

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.250 
that they pee on it too much like maybe
in<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.489> couple<00:04:08.519> spots<00:04:09.390> like<00:04:09.659> there<00:04:09.930> I'm<00:04:10.140> not

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
in a couple spots like there I'm not

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.199 
in a couple spots like there I'm not
even<00:04:10.439> sure<00:04:10.560> if<00:04:10.650> that's<00:04:10.739> actually<00:04:11.280> pee<00:04:11.489> but<00:04:12.180> I

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
even sure if that's actually pee but I

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.300 
even sure if that's actually pee but I
haven't<00:04:12.720> noticed<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.560> smelled<00:04:13.920> bad<00:04:14.069> and

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
haven't noticed that it smelled bad and

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550 
haven't noticed that it smelled bad and
I've<00:04:14.400> almost<00:04:14.879> had<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.420> for<00:04:15.720> probably<00:04:16.320> like<00:04:16.500> a

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
I've almost had this for probably like a

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.449 
I've almost had this for probably like a
month<00:04:16.919> or<00:04:17.039> two<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:19.070> they<00:04:20.070> do<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.430> to

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
month or two I think and they do like to

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.930 
month or two I think and they do like to
chew<00:04:20.910> there<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:23.009> lot<00:04:23.370> along<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
chew there and then a lot along the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.390 
chew there and then a lot along the
edges<00:04:24.449> here<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.530> I<00:04:25.560> haven't<00:04:26.070> really<00:04:26.280> noticed

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
edges here but I haven't really noticed

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.890 
edges here but I haven't really noticed
that<00:04:26.820> they've<00:04:26.970> been<00:04:27.240> able<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:27.509> get<00:04:27.690> out<00:04:27.780> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
that they've been able to get out the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.860 
that they've been able to get out the
wood<00:04:28.110> glue<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.820> wood<00:04:29.970> glue<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.240> non-toxic

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
wood glue so the wood glue is non-toxic

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.540 
wood glue so the wood glue is non-toxic
anyway<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.470> I'm<00:04:31.680> not<00:04:31.800> really<00:04:32.009> concerned<00:04:32.340> about

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
anyway so I'm not really concerned about

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.770 
anyway so I'm not really concerned about
it<00:04:34.190> but<00:04:35.190> overall<00:04:35.639> I<00:04:35.970> really<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.660> way

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
it but overall I really like the way

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.230 
it but overall I really like the way
that<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.770> loft<00:04:38.010> has<00:04:38.280> turned<00:04:38.580> out<00:04:38.729> I'm<00:04:39.120> really

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
that this loft has turned out I'm really

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.960 
that this loft has turned out I'm really
happy<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.110> pigs<00:04:40.320> love<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.680> they<00:04:41.490> love

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
happy with it the pigs love it they love

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.180 
happy with it the pigs love it they love
spending<00:04:42.570> time<00:04:42.690> I've<00:04:42.930> been<00:04:43.050> don't<00:04:43.229> loft<00:04:43.830> and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
spending time I've been don't loft and

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.640 
spending time I've been don't loft and
they<00:04:45.030> really<00:04:45.270> seem<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.479> enjoy<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.380> like<00:04:46.530> I

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
they really seem to enjoy it and like I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.140 
they really seem to enjoy it and like I
said<00:04:46.710> before<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.250> whole<00:04:47.430> project<00:04:47.789> cost<00:04:47.910> me

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
said before this whole project cost me

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.840 
said before this whole project cost me
probably<00:04:48.320> thirty<00:04:49.320> dollars<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.860> make<00:04:50.250> grids

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
probably thirty dollars to make grids

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.210 
probably thirty dollars to make grids
were<00:04:51.710> $15<00:04:52.710> other<00:04:53.490> supplementary<00:04:54.389> supplies

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
were $15 other supplementary supplies

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.680 
were $15 other supplementary supplies
costs<00:04:56.220> about<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.580> other<00:04:56.699> 15<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.360> spent

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
costs about the other 15 that I spent

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.740 
costs about the other 15 that I spent
and<00:04:58.260> I<00:04:58.860> have<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.190> Midwest<00:04:59.550> cage<00:04:59.789> so<00:05:00.539> that's

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
and I have the Midwest cage so that's

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.170 
and I have the Midwest cage so that's
why<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:00.930> had<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.229> use<00:05:01.500> zip<00:05:01.740> ties<00:05:01.949> if<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.669> have<00:05:02.880> a

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
why I had to use zip ties if you have a

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.180 
why I had to use zip ties if you have a
CNC<00:05:03.780> cage<00:05:03.990> obviously<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.650> can<00:05:04.800> use<00:05:04.979> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
CNC cage obviously you can use the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.589 
CNC cage obviously you can use the
connectors<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.639> come<00:05:06.000> with<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.270> grids

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
connectors that come with the grids

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.080 
connectors that come with the grids
but<00:05:07.349> if<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.889> use<00:05:08.099> the<00:05:08.250> connectors<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:09.000> would

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
but if I use the connectors it would

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.700 
but if I use the connectors it would
have<00:05:09.180> made<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.449> much<00:05:09.570> too<00:05:09.870> wide<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.349> my<00:05:10.440> cage

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
have made it much too wide for my cage

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.189 
have made it much too wide for my cage
so<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:11.820> is<00:05:11.940> why<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.180> zip<00:05:12.419> ties<00:05:12.599> if<00:05:12.900> you<00:05:13.080> have

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
so that is why you zip ties if you have

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.200 
so that is why you zip ties if you have
a<00:05:13.260> midwest<00:05:13.560> cage<00:05:13.770> I'm<00:05:14.010> not<00:05:14.490> really<00:05:14.699> sure<00:05:14.970> what

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
a midwest cage I'm not really sure what

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.850 
a midwest cage I'm not really sure what
else<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.570> could<00:05:15.780> use<00:05:15.990> other<00:05:16.229> than<00:05:16.349> zip<00:05:16.680> ties
