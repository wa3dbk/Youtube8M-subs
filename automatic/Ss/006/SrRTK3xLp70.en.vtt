auto hosting the competition how big a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.870 
auto hosting the competition how big a
deal<00:00:41.989> is<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.230> fear<00:00:42.530> it's<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.579> massive

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.660 
deal is this fear it's a massive
difference<00:00:44.079> I<00:00:45.079> think<00:00:45.170> at<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.190> moment<00:00:46.219> is<00:00:46.640> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
difference I think at the moment is a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.420 
difference I think at the moment is a
everyone<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:47.510> focused<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:48.110> preparing<00:00:48.920> really

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
everyone is focused on preparing really

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.729 
everyone is focused on preparing really
work<00:00:49.610> for<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.510> such<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.020> big<00:00:51.290> competition

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739

work for that and such a big competition
and<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.340> think<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.180> as<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.710> Polish<00:00:55.160> nation<00:00:55.340> we

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
and I think we as a Polish nation we

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.160 
and I think we as a Polish nation we
want<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.360> show<00:00:56.840> ourselves<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.899> in<00:00:59.899> a<00:00:59.989> good

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
for that even exponent of one of the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.919 
for that even exponent of one of the
most<00:01:09.740> one<00:01:10.399> of<00:01:10.459> the<00:01:10.580> newest<00:01:10.940> members<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.600> EU

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
most one of the newest members of the EU

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:13.690 
most one of the newest members of the EU
is<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.500> something<00:01:12.950> which<00:01:13.100> will<00:01:13.250> help<00:01:13.399> push

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
is this something which will help push

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.969 
is this something which will help push
the<00:01:13.850> country<00:01:14.179> forward<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.660> hope<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:15.289> i<00:01:15.500> think

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the country forward I hope so i think

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.910 
the country forward I hope so i think
because<00:01:16.850> i<00:01:17.270> think<00:01:17.660> at<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.110> moment<00:01:18.140> doors<00:01:18.740> are

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
because i think at the moment doors are

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.490 
because i think at the moment doors are
still<00:01:19.420> there<00:01:20.420> are<00:01:20.509> still<00:01:20.750> different<00:01:21.259> views

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
still there are still different views

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.300 
still there are still different views
about<00:01:22.509> poland<00:01:23.509> some<00:01:23.750> are<00:01:24.200> maybe<00:01:24.679> positive

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
about poland some are maybe positive

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.609 
about poland some are maybe positive
some<00:01:25.520> are<00:01:25.780> more<00:01:26.780> skeptical<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.429> think

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
some are more skeptical so I think

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.460 
some are more skeptical so I think
hopefully<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:31.099> that<00:01:31.369> euro<00:01:32.300> in<00:01:32.599> 2012<00:01:33.289> who

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
hopefully that that euro in 2012 who

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.410 
hopefully that that euro in 2012 who
will<00:01:33.830> help<00:01:34.550> maybe<00:01:35.149> change<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.729> about<00:01:38.149> our

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
will help maybe change of you about our

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.719

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
they were a bit scared even they thought

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.309

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
that Poland did still let's say few

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.070 
that Poland did still let's say few
years<00:02:03.500> behind<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.069> rest<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.489> Europe<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:05.080> think

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
years behind the rest of Europe I think

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.559 
years behind the rest of Europe I think

to prepare ourselves in a good way to be

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.220 
to prepare ourselves in a good way to be
honest<00:04:01.640> at<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.940> moment<00:04:02.270> our<00:04:02.420> results<00:04:02.930> I'm<00:04:03.050> not

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
honest at the moment our results I'm not

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.400 
honest at the moment our results I'm not
good<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:04.100> mean<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.420> Polish<00:04:05.720> national<00:04:05.900> team

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.460 
good I mean the the Polish national team
but<00:04:06.680> there<00:04:07.430> is<00:04:07.520> still<00:04:07.640> room<00:04:08.230> for<00:04:09.230> improvement

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
but there is still room for improvement

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.400 
but there is still room for improvement
there<00:04:10.070> was<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.280> still<00:04:10.670> time<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.840> use<00:04:12.020> it<00:04:12.170> well

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
there was a still time to use it well

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.770 
there was a still time to use it well
and<00:04:12.620> hopefully<00:04:13.220> we're<00:04:13.790> going<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.030> be<00:04:14.180> no<00:04:14.540> ready
