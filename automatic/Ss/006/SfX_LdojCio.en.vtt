 little bit more and one are apart from four 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.560
 pages with a lot of information that I'll go 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.220
 climbing quietly 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.050
 anxo with images are worth the ones 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.590
 You see now 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.570
 our screens and well let's say you can 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.059
 be a little a little analysis like that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.010
 quickie is worth what we can see and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.250
 well the first image we see a view 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.430
 spectacular of the life of the saints the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.500
 van gundy poster back we see where it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.629
 finds the caravan in the last one to the subject 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.730
 of the last photos that I uploaded and good 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.930
 we see as a house of these of those of 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.760
 that are made like metal that are 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 as it made so 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.810
 I can see and I think it's good we see there 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.820
 in the background anxiety that is that you see 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.729
 impressive the rendering with all 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.190
 the lights that is it seems to be real or 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.830
 be real life the whole cycle 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.840
 well we see the following image that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.930
 we go to michael but we see michael with 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.680
 beard and it looks like a Chinese is 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.300
 appears in the slanted eyes I do not know is 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 awesome as you know we can 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.380
 modify it then a garlic whatever in the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.050
 head that is the head in plan the hair 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.250
 the beard etcetera the groups modify and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.410
 in this image we have been taught to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.420
 michael then with a beard and steps in the background 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.880
 the city 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.090
 the peta or the zone has been pressed 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.060
 of the casinos and so let's go 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.260
 move on to the next image 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.630
 and as you can see 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.510
 we have here to the sea and franklin vale 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.160
 let's go to franklin that 's style like that with 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.220
 an American cap let's say to achievement 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.220
 street as you know and well they are 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.130
 here let's say a mechanical workshop with what 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 that I will go see up ships for wheels 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.660
 are both for lots these can be 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 be the car and then I read to him lifts a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.820
 little of now is not the car 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.250
 what is it but they have given me a 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.870
 clear analysis direct and good well what 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.720
 who are in a mechanical workshop and a 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.100
 little else is a following image and good 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.830
 let's go here now 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.870
 franklin leaning on a motorcycle that I want 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.530
 that this image has already seen it or a 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.960
 similar or this is not the one I see it 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.560
 and well, as you can see there the effect of 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.990
 Sun as it hits or is it hard or not is that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.490
 I do not see your eyes but it's 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.220
 super good this thing that even seems to be 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.380
 real and all good in the next in the 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.920
 next in the next image we see 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.360
 a helicopter is worth and good is a 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.650
 typical photo that we have always seen the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 helicopter grace of the saints to 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.070
 technique background photo but good 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.840
 we see here from another part we go there the 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.480
 edition works the I was invented gÃ¼ere 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.580
 other buildings of the saints and we see 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.690
 here as the industrial zone seems to be 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.820
 and well the following image we see 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.200
 michael descending making fast by 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.480
 the players and clone is a building 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.360
 I think it's the mission that came out in 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.960
 the gameplay and well there in the background to see 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.180
 the city 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.010
 we go to the next image 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.220
 it and have seen it is the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.010
 when he passes the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.010
 the train by the river bridge 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.840
 and to the bottom that is franklin what was 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.310
 I was in prague and in journalism valley 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.860
 it's supposed to fall on top of the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.450
 train and good we see all the fauna there 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.150
 what is technology to give a little 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.799
 Well, that's going to be very similar to the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.450
 red dead redemption and it goes like it can not 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.470
 do everything because it's all forest 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.870
 very impressive mountain and we're leaving 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.319
 here another photo is worth we see 3 word 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.090
 going back with a gun, let's go to the bottom 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.830
 it's like he has destroyed a car 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.360
 good seems to be that from what I see 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.730
 creative symbol you see a door and 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 bursting we see smoke we see that it has 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.190
 changed clothes wearing a polo shirt 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.710
 brown well with touches good so there 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.110
 it's okay let's go in the arm 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.139
 left his left arm with a 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.940
 Cacho tattoo bearing and see that 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.440
 I went to the clock too and nothing is 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.790
 changed in the other image we see here 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.900
 let's say as if it were a postal voucher of 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.190
 some areas of common good and we 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.350
 that there are some booths that are already 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.100
 little oxidized let's say it's a small 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.030
 port away from the mountains and then 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.120
 who live 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.750
 some fishermen and such is quite 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.520
 cool also that 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.949
 and well, here we see another image worth 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.050
 in which we see an airplane that is the 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.370
 tight the engine behind or if it's in 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.379
 you call this image I think that also 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.860
 we have seen not what will be good for the 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:12.099
 it sounds a lot and well then what 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.080
 leads trevor and well let's say that 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.690
 He is going to speak against but do not know 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.069
 if it is going to arrive because as you see the 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.229
 plane is fatal and one of the lights 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.110
 impressive spectacular quality 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.530
 or very realistic and as I say and good 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.780
 it's an incentive image and we're going to 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.340
 franklin trevor and maikel 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.920
 we go well we can see franklin in the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.720
 right and a haircut not like the one on 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.000
 but as always it is carrying some are 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.400
 called the type of hair be private 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.920
 lines on the sides as you see and 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.630
 disheveled and good that we are going to have 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.700
 because it is with different clothes and a 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.970
 blouse or in a blouse a little jacket and 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.030
 a shirt and inside carries another 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.760
 T-shirt that is thrown to work 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.260
 jeans franklin bay with a 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.880
 black jacket there button 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.730
 looking as always with his suit his 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.180
 tie and huelva christ so that what 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.370
 they're going to roll 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.949
 and well here we see another image with a 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.990
 orange car and the police 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.900
 behind that follows the effect of the juve 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.020
 on the ground in the reflections are 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.750
 impressive 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520
 these are images worth in employment 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.620
 when we are playing and we can 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.180
 see the same quality since we've been 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.009
 super fast and we hardly notice 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.910
 but for you to give the details are 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.670
 very good and good then a little more than 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.380
 twists 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.320
 good good take that the other two 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.940
 the images will also put and 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.370
 it's also from another bushehr you see 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.680
 here is in the breeding of the saints 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.970
 and what I have said to 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.080
 the helicopters and well let's go here to 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.810
 another is a different mask let's say 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.780
 which is in front of the hood of a car 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.400
 policemen is worth a full shootout and three 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.020
 guys shooting it and he's in there then 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.030
 trying to protect themselves so that they do not 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.970
 stick montero and the last image is 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.650
 wheat and maikel in diving vale michael 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.120
 is the crossing there clover as it is not the one 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.630
 manages the submarine as we have seen in 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.430
 the last video that climbed rocks after the 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.680
 ad that is there super trevor 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.080
 happy in the submarine and well then 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.880
 little else will be saying if something comes out 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.830
 again not only something will come out and good 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.360
 Well, it's what you liked, we'll see you 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.360
 in the next video and see you later
