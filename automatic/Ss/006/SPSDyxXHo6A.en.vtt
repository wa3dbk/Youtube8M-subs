all<00:07:02.559> the<00:07:02.860> way<00:07:03.009> to<00:07:03.539> this<00:07:04.539> and<00:07:05.219> everything<00:07:06.219> we<00:07:06.459> do

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 
all the way to this and everything we do

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.420 
all the way to this and everything we do
is<00:07:06.819> high<00:07:07.029> quality<00:07:07.629> and<00:07:07.930> is<00:07:08.319> in-house<00:07:08.889> and

is high quality and is in-house and

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.610 
is high quality and is in-house and
again<00:07:10.149> that's<00:07:10.389> important<00:07:10.990> thing<00:07:11.139> because<00:07:11.289> we

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
again that's important thing because we

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.309 
again that's important thing because we
can<00:07:11.830> manipulate<00:07:12.550> or<00:07:13.240> do<00:07:13.539> whatever<00:07:13.749> you<00:07:14.139> need
