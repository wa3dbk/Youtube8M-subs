00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
depressed that this channel is going to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.040 
depressed that this channel is going to
be<00:00:15.960> kind<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> like<00:00:16.619> closing<00:00:17.580> off<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.600> next

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

year since I'll be abroad in Japan but I
have<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> new<00:00:22.500> channel<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.369> I'm<00:00:23.519> not

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
have the new channel for that so I'm not

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.240 
have the new channel for that so I'm not
really<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.810> not<00:00:24.990> technically<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> end<00:00:25.890> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
really it's not technically the end I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
really it's not technically the end I
like<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> quote<00:00:27.240> from<00:00:27.510> physics<00:00:27.930> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
like to use the quote from physics is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
like to use the quote from physics is
like<00:00:28.320> nothing<00:00:29.039> ever<00:00:29.160> ends<00:00:29.460> things<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
like nothing ever ends things just

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.290 
like nothing ever ends things just
simply<00:00:30.660> transform<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.180> when<00:00:33.180> we're

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
simply transform you know when we're

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.030 
simply transform you know when we're
talking<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.570> energy<00:00:34.050> wise<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:36.390> yeah<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
talking about energy wise but yeah so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.290 
talking about energy wise but yeah so
the<00:00:38.040> firt<00:00:38.250> I've<00:00:38.520> been<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> like

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
this plot this unfinished plot that I

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.380 
this plot this unfinished plot that I
made<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.070> some<00:00:59.070> time<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> summer<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
made I some time over the summer but it

was like during a late night stream with

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.609 
was like during a late night stream with
X<00:01:02.760> oxide<00:01:03.439> and<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> city<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.290> inspired<00:01:07.290> by

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
X oxide and this city was inspired by

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.980 
X oxide and this city was inspired by
the<00:01:07.680> Boston<00:01:08.549> Big<00:01:08.820> Dig<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.600> guys<00:01:09.720> don't

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
elevated highway in Boston and submerge

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.179 
elevated highway in Boston and submerge
it<00:01:20.189> underground<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
it underground and this is kind of like

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
it underground and this is kind of like
what<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> did<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.540> left<00:01:24.780> off<00:01:25.020> not

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
what I did here where I left off not

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
what I did here where I left off not
exactly<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> left<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:26.820> went

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
exactly where I left off I actually went

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
exactly where I left off I actually went
in<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.720> changed<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> few<00:01:28.590> things

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
in here and just changed up a few things

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
in here and just changed up a few things
like<00:01:29.040> adding<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.430> train<00:01:29.670> station<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.240> stuff

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like adding this train station and stuff

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.850 
like adding this train station and stuff
like<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.960> destroyed<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
like that and destroyed all the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
like that and destroyed all the
buildings<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:33.299> everything<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> pretty<00:01:33.869> much

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
buildings but everything was pretty much

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.300 
buildings but everything was pretty much
kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> same

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
kind of the same

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.160 
kind of the same
and<00:01:37.310> also<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.940> since<00:01:38.300> like<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.690> Boston<00:01:39.020> Big

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
and also that since like the Boston Big

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.950 
and also that since like the Boston Big
Dig<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.530> all<00:01:40.300> underground<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.630> stuff<00:01:41.810> like

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
Dig is all underground and stuff like

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.469 
Dig is all underground and stuff like
that<00:01:42.170> a<00:01:42.200> very<00:01:42.500> huge<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.580> expensive<00:01:44.150> highway

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
that a very huge and expensive highway

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.840 
that a very huge and expensive highway
system<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:45.050> underground<00:01:45.620> which<00:01:46.280> costs<00:01:46.700> them

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
system all underground which costs them

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.640 
system all underground which costs them
which<00:01:47.420> costs<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.990> city<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.290> Boston<00:01:48.619> like

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
which costs the city of Boston like

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.850 
which costs the city of Boston like
billions<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.310> dollars<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.900> was<00:01:51.170> not<00:01:51.470> an

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
billions of dollars like it was not an

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.690 
billions of dollars like it was not an
yeah<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.520> cheap<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.350> easy<00:01:54.700> construction

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
yeah a cheap and easy construction

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.580 
yeah a cheap and easy construction
project<00:01:56.119> they<00:01:56.450> actually<00:01:56.810> ran<00:01:56.930> into<00:01:57.140> several

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
project they actually ran into several

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.719 
project they actually ran into several
problems<00:01:59.470> sorry<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.560> just<00:02:00.920> saw<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.510 
problems sorry I just saw this and I
just<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.210> fix<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.600> because<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.990> my<00:02:03.080> OCD

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
just have to fix it because of my OCD

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.510 
just have to fix it because of my OCD
but<00:02:04.520> anyways<00:02:05.380> since<00:02:06.380> Boston<00:02:07.070> big<00:02:07.340> digs

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
but anyways since Boston big digs

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.960 
but anyways since Boston big digs
underground<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:09.170> Sim<00:02:10.100> City<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.670> doesn't

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
underground and Sim City it doesn't

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.490 
underground and Sim City it doesn't
really<00:02:11.090> it<00:02:11.360> cannot<00:02:11.570> really<00:02:11.810> work<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.260> way<00:02:12.470> a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
really it cannot really work that way a

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.530 
really it cannot really work that way a
hundred<00:02:12.860> percent<00:02:12.950> because<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.090> cannot<00:02:14.330> have

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
hundred percent because we cannot have

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.630 
hundred percent because we cannot have
intersections<00:02:15.310> underground<00:02:16.310> with<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
intersections underground with the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.250 
intersections underground with the
tunnels<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.690> what<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:20.230> kind<00:02:21.230> of

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
tunnels so what I have to do is kind of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.500 
tunnels so what I have to do is kind of
like<00:02:21.440> submerge<00:02:22.340> underground<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.390> it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
like submerge underground and have it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.770 
like submerge underground and have it
resurfaced<00:02:24.730> which<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.060> as<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.600> see

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
resurfaced which is like as you can see

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.229 
resurfaced which is like as you can see
her<00:02:26.930> resurface<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.830> can<00:02:28.070> build<00:02:28.310> some<00:02:28.580> off

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
her resurface so I can build some off

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.150 
her resurface so I can build some off
ramps<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.050> on<00:02:30.200> ramps<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.070> then

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
ramps and on ramps like that and then

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.860 
ramps and on ramps like that and then
have<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.580> go<00:02:31.610> back<00:02:31.730> underground

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
have it go back underground

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.199 
have it go back underground
which<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:33.920> kind<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.280> very<00:02:34.640> small<00:02:35.030> right

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
which is kind of like very small right

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.030 
which is kind of like very small right
here<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.600> then<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:35.750> resurface<00:02:36.530> again<00:02:36.680> for

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
here and then just resurface again for

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.949 
here and then just resurface again for
more<00:02:37.250> ramps<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.850> this<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.269> you<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.420> see<00:02:38.510> and

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
more ramps like this as you can see and

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.430 
more ramps like this as you can see and
then<00:02:39.680> when<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.549> back<00:02:40.760> underground

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
then when I go back underground

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.039 
then when I go back underground
resurface<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.769> then<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.040> back<00:02:43.250> underground

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
resurface and then go back underground

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.780 
resurface and then go back underground
and<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.140> try<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.380> kind<00:02:45.799> of<00:02:45.950> keep<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.459> highway

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and I try to kind of keep the highway

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.590 
and I try to kind of keep the highway
footprint<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.750> freeway<00:02:48.019> footprint<00:02:48.530> very<00:02:49.190> low

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
footprint the freeway footprint very low

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.130 
footprint the freeway footprint very low
so<00:02:50.600> that<00:02:50.810> way<00:02:50.930> it's<00:02:51.110> not<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.459> big<00:02:53.019> but<00:02:54.019> it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
so that way it's not like so big but it

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.990 
so that way it's not like so big but it
might<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.500> end<00:02:54.650> up<00:02:54.829> being<00:02:55.070> big<00:02:55.310> anyways<00:02:55.730> just

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
might just end up being big anyways just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.420 
might just end up being big anyways just
because<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.540> how<00:02:56.690> much<00:02:56.900> how<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.650> Sim<00:02:58.250> City

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
because of how much how the Sim City

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.009 
because of how much how the Sim City
mechanics<00:02:58.910> work<00:02:59.090> where<00:02:59.329> I<00:02:59.360> have<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.750> put

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
mechanics work where I have to like put

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.630 
mechanics work where I have to like put
stuff<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.610> know<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:03.310> what<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.910> about<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
stuff you know and what I like about the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.680 
stuff you know and what I like about the
underground<00:03:07.640> freeway<00:03:08.000> system<00:03:08.390> is<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.630> you

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
underground freeway system is that you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.120 
underground freeway system is that you
can<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.079> like<00:03:09.290> ramps<00:03:09.530> going<00:03:09.950> all<00:03:10.100> over

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
can have like ramps going all over

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.420 
can have like ramps going all over
around<00:03:10.790> city<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:12.590> don't<00:03:13.220> know<00:03:13.400> if

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
around city like this I don't know if

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.039 
around city like this I don't know if
you<00:03:13.549> can<00:03:13.640> maybe<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.269> can<00:03:14.420> turn<00:03:14.570> onto<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> power

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
you can maybe I can turn onto the power

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.199 
you can maybe I can turn onto the power
map<00:03:15.320> which<00:03:16.010> will<00:03:16.160> be<00:03:16.250> much<00:03:16.489> more<00:03:16.670> easier<00:03:17.060> to

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
map which will be much more easier to

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.360 
map which will be much more easier to
see<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.900> roads<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.350> guess<00:03:18.530> since<00:03:19.010> there's<00:03:19.220> no

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
see the roads I guess since there's no

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.869 
see the roads I guess since there's no
power<00:03:19.640> though<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.150> cannot<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.600> show<00:03:20.720> you

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
power though I cannot really show you

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.970 
power though I cannot really show you
with<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.719> powerlines<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.469> you<00:03:23.620> know<00:03:23.709> we<00:03:23.829> have

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
with the powerlines but you know we have

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.750 
with the powerlines but you know we have
like<00:03:24.189> this<00:03:24.450> ramp<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:26.620> goes<00:03:26.680> into<00:03:27.129> like<00:03:27.609> kind

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
like this ramp that goes into like kind

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.309 
like this ramp that goes into like kind
of<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:27.969> central<00:03:28.389> downtown<00:03:28.599> and<00:03:29.170> then<00:03:29.260> we

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
of like the central downtown and then we

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.129 
of like the central downtown and then we
have<00:03:29.409> another<00:03:29.650> one<00:03:29.889> over<00:03:29.920> here<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:32.019> can

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
have another one over here you can

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.099 
have another one over here you can
really<00:03:32.349> bypass<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:32.920> lot<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.280> things<00:03:33.489> here<00:03:33.730> and

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
really bypass a lot of things here and

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.709 
really bypass a lot of things here and
with<00:03:35.109> these<00:03:35.260> ramps<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.950> stuff<00:03:36.219> like<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.719> and

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:37.719 
with these ramps and stuff like that and

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.920 
with these ramps and stuff like that and
I<00:03:37.840> also<00:03:38.049> have<00:03:38.349> like<00:03:38.639> this<00:03:39.639> railroad<00:03:40.510> track

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
I also have like this railroad track

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.750 
I also have like this railroad track
that<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.260> kind<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.769> just<00:03:41.950> built<00:03:42.280> here<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.670> to

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
that I kind of just built here just to

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.559 
that I kind of just built here just to
make<00:03:42.879> it<00:03:42.939> look<00:03:43.060> cool

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
make it look cool

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.929 
make it look cool
I<00:03:43.599> don't<00:03:44.500> think<00:03:44.560> Boston<00:03:45.099> has<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> railroad

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
I don't think Boston has a railroad

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.240 
I don't think Boston has a railroad
track<00:03:46.150> here<00:03:46.629> well<00:03:47.469> actually<00:03:47.650> maybe<00:03:48.010> they<00:03:48.189> do

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
track here well actually maybe they do

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.559 
track here well actually maybe they do
in<00:03:49.239> Boston<00:03:49.510> Boston<00:03:50.579> train<00:03:51.579> station<00:03:52.120> somewhere

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
in Boston Boston train station somewhere

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.409 
in Boston Boston train station somewhere
downtown<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.260> over<00:03:53.439> here<00:03:53.680> but<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:55.180> added

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
downtown and over here but I just added

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.809 
downtown and over here but I just added
that<00:03:55.689> to<00:03:56.379> make<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.530> look<00:03:56.650> cool<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.159> I've<00:03:57.310> put

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
that to make it look cool and I've put
