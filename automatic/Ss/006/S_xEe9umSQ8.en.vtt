to<00:02:56.380> watch<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.860> think<00:02:57.160> this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.490> one<00:02:57.670> of<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
to watch I think this is one of the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.960 
to watch I think this is one of the
reasons<00:02:58.090> why<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:59.290> content<00:02:59.830> creators<00:03:00.100> we're

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
reasons why as content creators we're

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.060 
reasons why as content creators we're
constantly<00:03:01.450> pushing<00:03:01.990> out<00:03:02.110> our<00:03:02.290> social<00:03:02.800> media

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
constantly pushing out our social media

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.610 
constantly pushing out our social media
challenge<00:03:03.490> because<00:03:03.850> we<00:03:04.660> can't<00:03:04.930> track<00:03:05.350> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
challenge because we can't track the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.050 
challenge because we can't track the
subscription<00:03:06.100> box<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.580> that's<00:03:06.760> why<00:03:06.910> we're

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
subscription box so that's why we're

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.640

the<00:05:40.680> best<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:41.069> best<00:05:41.279> you<00:05:41.520> can<00:05:41.580> because

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
the best the best you can because

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.790 
the best the best you can because
through<00:05:42.060> people<00:05:42.479> go<00:05:42.629> oh<00:05:42.810> then<00:05:43.500> this<00:05:43.650> should

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
through people go oh then this should

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.200 
through people go oh then this should
watch<00:05:44.009> someone<00:05:44.310> else<00:05:44.400> cuz<00:05:44.699> there<00:05:44.879> is<00:05:45.000> another

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
watch someone else cuz there is another

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.110 
watch someone else cuz there is another
version<00:05:45.569> of<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.990> maybe<00:05:46.919> not<00:05:47.159> exactly<00:05:47.580> like

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
version of you maybe not exactly like

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.879 
version of you maybe not exactly like
you<00:05:48.150> but<00:05:48.360> there<00:05:48.689> is<00:05:48.779> another<00:05:49.080> version<00:05:49.349> of<00:05:49.680> what

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
you but there is another version of what

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.320 
you but there is another version of what
you<00:05:50.039> do<00:05:50.279> I'm<00:05:50.909> probably<00:05:51.089> doing<00:05:51.360> better<00:05:53.330> because

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
you do I'm probably doing better because

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.570 
you do I'm probably doing better because
they<00:05:54.479> make<00:05:55.169> awesome<00:05:55.409> videos<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:56.159> just<00:05:56.310> don't

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
they make awesome videos so just don't

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.459 
they make awesome videos so just don't
have<00:05:56.879> the<00:05:57.360> same<00:05:57.569> subscribers<00:05:58.110> as<00:05:58.199> the<00:05:58.289> ones

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
have the same subscribers as the ones

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.170 
have the same subscribers as the ones
that<00:05:58.589> variable<00:05:59.069> possibility<00:05:59.849> based<00:06:02.180> it's

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
that variable possibility based it's

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.689 
that variable possibility based it's
weird<00:06:03.560> how<00:06:04.560> everything's<00:06:05.039> kind<00:06:05.279> of<00:06:05.339> evolved

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
weird how everything's kind of evolved

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.100 
weird how everything's kind of evolved
and<00:06:05.789> change<00:06:06.089> and<00:06:06.389> there<00:06:06.569> is<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.719> huge

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
and change and there is a huge

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.540 
and change and there is a huge
difference<00:06:07.349> between<00:06:07.560> five<00:06:07.949> years<00:06:08.159> ago<00:06:08.339> now

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
difference between five years ago now

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.399

and most of that's mostly because

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.320
