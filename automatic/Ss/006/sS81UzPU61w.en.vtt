00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.330 
of plastic I guess I think it's supposed
to<00:02:09.720> represent<00:02:09.869> like<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.350> cigar<00:02:10.739> box<00:02:10.799> or

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to represent like a cigar box or

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.449 
to represent like a cigar box or
something<00:02:13.370> doesn't<00:02:14.370> open<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:14.970> though

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
up all the time these games are usually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.259

number 38 poker chip and I'm no expert
on<00:04:16.340> metals<00:04:16.789> but<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.030> don't<00:04:17.299> think<00:04:17.510> this<00:04:17.660> is

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
on metals but I don't think this is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.199 
on metals but I don't think this is
really<00:04:18.049> fly<00:04:18.350> them<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:18.950> yeah<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.700> said<00:04:19.729> I'm

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
really fly them but yeah like I said I'm

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.870 
really fly them but yeah like I said I'm
not<00:04:20.269> an<00:04:20.570> expert<00:04:21.010> feels<00:04:22.010> like<00:04:22.220> stainless<00:04:22.520> steel

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
not an expert feels like stainless steel

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.670 
not an expert feels like stainless steel
to<00:04:23.030> me<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.950> it's<00:04:25.220> still<00:04:25.460> pretty<00:04:25.639> cool<00:04:26.680> and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
to me but it's still pretty cool and

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.940 
to me but it's still pretty cool and
these<00:04:28.039> are<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.550> poker<00:04:29.300> chips<00:04:29.680> they<00:04:30.680> come<00:04:30.919> with

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
these are the poker chips they come with

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.010 
these are the poker chips they come with
it<00:04:31.280> not

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
it not

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.960 
it not
full<00:04:32.289> set<00:04:32.650> or<00:04:32.919> anything<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.580> just<00:04:33.669> a<00:04:34.060> few<00:04:34.509> I

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
full set or anything it's just a few I

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.290 
full set or anything it's just a few I
guess<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.120> path<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.539> them<00:04:39.090> exactly<00:04:40.090> might

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
guess the path to them exactly might

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.379 
guess the path to them exactly might
even<00:04:40.479> be<00:04:40.949> not<00:04:41.949> completely<00:04:42.580> shitty<00:04:42.849> quality
