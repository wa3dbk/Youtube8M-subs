and<00:01:41.270> for<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> case<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.920> would

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
and for that in for that case I would

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
and for that in for that case I would
use<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.360> hebei<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.570> told<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.079> would<00:01:46.229> say<00:01:46.320> taba

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

day I the verb plus your you change the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.459 
day I the verb plus your you change the
ending<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.829> your<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.420> add<00:01:57.630> toss<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.350> do

ending to your and then add toss to do

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310 
ending to your and then add toss to do
and<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.340> course<00:01:59.399> pseudo<00:01:59.790> means<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.290> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and of course pseudo means to do so you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.280 
and of course pseudo means to do so you
can<00:02:01.590> also<00:02:01.740> change<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:03.200> conjugation<00:02:04.200> of
