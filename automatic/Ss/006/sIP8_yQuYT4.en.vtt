think my background in rodeo has helped

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.480 
think my background in rodeo has helped
me<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.230> department<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.890> learned<00:00:23.369> how

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
me well in that department I learned how

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.800 
me well in that department I learned how
to<00:00:23.519> fall<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.240> didn't<00:00:24.420> ride<00:00:24.570> very

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to fall because they didn't ride very

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
to fall because they didn't ride very
often<00:00:25.140> when<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> was<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> rodeos

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
often when I was trying to go to rodeos

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
often when I was trying to go to rodeos
and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.539> has<00:00:27.720> helped<00:00:27.930> me

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and I think that that has helped me

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.419 
and I think that that has helped me
learn<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> fall<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.160> when<00:00:29.310> an

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
learn how to fall here so when an

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.669 
learn how to fall here so when an
accident<00:00:29.609> happens<00:00:29.939> I'm<00:00:30.810> able<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.349> tuck

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
accident happens I'm able to just tuck

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470 
accident happens I'm able to just tuck
and<00:00:31.890> roll<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.099> go<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> flow<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.090> I

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and roll and go with the flow and I

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.729 
and roll and go with the flow and I
think<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> has<00:00:34.020> helped<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> avoid

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

think that has helped me to avoid
serious<00:00:35.040> injury<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.579> some<00:00:35.730> point<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.059> must
