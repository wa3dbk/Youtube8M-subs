00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.890
 here in photoshop not for you 3 or 4 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.029
 all because to see various 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.349
 examples to see how they can behave 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.349
 using the fabric couples the la 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.320
 anna 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 maybe an image has a portrait 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.030
 good Sunday approaching certain things I love you I am with your mind my daughter 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.679
 that 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.379
 forever available for these things, I call you back I am done on the seabed 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.220
 photographic 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.820
 if something I would like to point out when we open more images 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 simultaneously in the cs4 version photoshop 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.699
 the at the opening &amp; lt 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.280
 nicks and windows if we find them all here 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.610
 and I often hear myself ask how it is possible to drag an image inside 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.850
 the other one 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.570
 in this situation 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.650
 to make it easier we can return to the standard image display 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.790
 so with the superimposing windows overlapping a child window orders 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.390
 all the movable windows we have this ahahha classic view of in ours 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.390
 photo 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.940
 sometimes these are the levels because we will naturally need it for 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.130
 to compose 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.790
 and on the sea 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 different images 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.570
 and let's see what can happen 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 the tool moves we activate 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.840
 or one of our friends background of our text let's drag it literally 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 inside ours 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990
 images that the draft 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.110
 weight here or the same size the same resolution for eyes will be able to us 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.690
 the situation in which 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.030
 image 1 pictures the biggest i have smaller 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.180
 and as usual with change transform 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.479
 the scale we have the possibility to adapt our picture so if there 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.959
 we find in India quotes of this kind hahaha we will do nothing but art 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.519
 attack lots and vice versa if 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.969
 nc images is bigger we will reduce up to bring 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.969
 good total coverage of 4 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.479
 and here you will already have understood I chose portrait because 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.289
 I think you could marry adapt 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:32.099
 aetnanet be combined with some of these 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.279
 doctor himself 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.129
 the possibilities are so many minds 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.309
 net the first time 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:45.419
 returning to the old method of the overexposed slides report me 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.409
 same historical world situation 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.439
 then a light soft image exposed above 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.289
 sansovino unknown why we could see that he was going 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.660
 coupled with a high I go that yes 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.399
 combinations 2 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:08.619
 the 2 images can also be 3 ho 4 is not said that only one 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.239
 me can make our own combinations 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.070
 hotel 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.459
 pleasant 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.299
 so this here on the opacity we already have a fusion a first result 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.619
 we can also find haruhi skiing the picture because 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.409
 the specials of a situation like this 2 is not uniform if we do 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.909
 change transform 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.599
 q8 at 180 degrees naturally after selecting 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.829
 the level 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.889
 angela texture we have another result yet
