on the on the tabletop you can use these
a<00:01:06.730> lot<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.060> them<00:01:07.180> pop<00:01:07.630> right<00:01:07.869> off<00:01:07.900> like<00:01:08.260> this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
a lot of them pop right off like this

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.430 
a lot of them pop right off like this
one<00:01:08.619> does<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.570> can<00:01:10.720> do<00:01:10.810> what<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.990> would<00:01:11.229> do

one does or you can do what I would do
and<00:01:11.650> that's<00:01:12.160> use<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.910> as<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> gluing<00:01:13.600> surface

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
and that's use this as a gluing surface

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.109 
and that's use this as a gluing surface
and<00:01:14.260> then<00:01:14.860> put<00:01:15.369> my<00:01:15.490> ground<00:01:15.729> foam<00:01:15.970> material

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
and then put my ground foam material

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.240 
and then put my ground foam material
over<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:16.960> base<00:01:17.170> so<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.619> it<00:01:17.800> doesn't<00:01:17.950> show

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
over the base so that it doesn't show

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.160 
over the base so that it doesn't show
but<00:01:18.790> what<00:01:18.910> i<00:01:18.940> want<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.210> show<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.360> right<00:01:19.660> now<00:01:19.900> is

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
but what i want to show you right now is

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.040 
but what i want to show you right now is
a<00:01:20.950> little<00:01:21.130> dry<00:01:21.430> brushing<00:01:22.000> before<00:01:22.660> i<00:01:22.690> do<00:01:22.780> on

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
a little dry brushing before i do on

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.840 
a little dry brushing before i do on
this<00:01:23.200> tree<00:01:23.530> i<00:01:23.560> talked<00:01:23.890> about<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.460> i<00:01:24.610> showed

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
this tree i talked about and i showed

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.420 
this tree i talked about and i showed
you<00:01:24.880> getting<00:01:25.690> rid<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:26.020> parting<00:01:26.470> line<00:01:26.650> and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
you getting rid of that parting line and

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.630 
you getting rid of that parting line and
i<00:01:27.850> want<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.090> do<00:01:28.150> that<00:01:28.270> again<00:01:28.540> on<00:01:28.660> this<00:01:28.810> tree<00:01:29.110> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
i want to do that again on this tree and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.070 
i want to do that again on this tree and
i'm<00:01:30.640> just<00:01:30.790> going<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.000> scrape<00:01:31.420> away<00:01:31.660> a<00:01:31.810> little

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
i'm just going to scrape away a little

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.340 
i'm just going to scrape away a little
bit<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:33.790> go<00:01:34.119> away<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.840> can<00:01:35.020> see<00:01:35.229> how

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
bit make it go away you can see how

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.480 
bit make it go away you can see how
shiny<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:36.420> plastic<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.190> obviously<00:01:39.190> we

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
shiny this plastic is and obviously we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.330 
shiny this plastic is and obviously we
probably<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:39.940> want<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.800> on<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:41.860> finished

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
probably don't want that on the finished

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.999 
probably don't want that on the finished
tree<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:44.020> got<00:01:44.200> rid<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.500> parting<00:01:44.830> line

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
tree so I got rid of the parting line

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.740 
tree so I got rid of the parting line
and<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.670> what<00:01:45.820> I'm<00:01:45.880> going<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.090> do<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.450> take

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
and now what I'm going to do is take

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.960 
and now what I'm going to do is take
some<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.259> medium<00:01:47.770> gray<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.610> I<00:01:48.670> showed

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
some of this medium gray that I showed

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.919

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.000 
unfortunately if you don't do this step
you're<00:02:11.920> going<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.100> lose<00:02:12.280> all<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.790> bark<00:02:13.030> detail

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you're going to lose all the bark detail

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.920 
you're going to lose all the bark detail
so<00:02:15.010> I'm<00:02:15.190> just<00:02:15.430> adding<00:02:15.700> some<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.360> this<00:02:16.450> medium

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930

mold<00:02:23.709> creates<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.550> this<00:02:24.730> tree<00:02:25.690> which<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
mold creates on this tree which is the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.900 
mold creates on this tree which is the
bark<00:02:26.530> detail<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.740> pretty<00:02:30.550> much<00:02:30.580> what<00:02:30.819> i'm

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
plastic and i'm creating the effects of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.339 
plastic and i'm creating the effects of
the<00:02:43.150> Sun<00:02:43.390> let<00:02:43.599> me<00:02:43.659> just<00:02:43.840> turn<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.319> little

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
the Sun let me just turn this a little

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.040 
the Sun let me just turn this a little
more<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.950> can<00:02:45.129> see<00:02:45.370> it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.240 

there<00:02:52.050> are<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.230> lot<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.410> different<00:02:52.800> colors<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
there are a lot of different colors I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.240 
there are a lot of different colors I
could<00:02:53.460> use<00:02:53.820> but<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.320> look<00:02:55.530> closely<00:02:55.800> at

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
could use but if you look closely at

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.710 
could use but if you look closely at
tree<00:02:56.610> bark<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.900> not<00:02:58.050> brown<00:02:58.500> anyway

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
tree bark it's really not brown anyway

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.770 
tree bark it's really not brown anyway
it's<00:03:00.830> dark<00:03:01.830> grey<00:03:02.190> there's<00:03:02.880> some<00:03:03.210> dark<00:03:03.480> Browns

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's dark grey there's some dark Browns

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.360 
it's dark grey there's some dark Browns
in<00:03:04.050> there<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.410> some<00:03:04.620> cases<00:03:04.830> there<00:03:05.130> are<00:03:05.160> some

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
in there in some cases there are some

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.820 
in there in some cases there are some
light<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.670> Browns<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.900> hodgepodge<00:03:07.440> of

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
light of Browns but it's a hodgepodge of

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.000 
light of Browns but it's a hodgepodge of
colors<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.770> stay

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
colors so there's really if I stay

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.730 
colors so there's really if I stay
within<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> grayscale<00:03:12.290> there's<00:03:13.290> really<00:03:13.470> no

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
within the grayscale there's really no

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740 
within the grayscale there's really no
wrong<00:03:13.980> color<00:03:14.310> choice<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:15.390> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.570> put
