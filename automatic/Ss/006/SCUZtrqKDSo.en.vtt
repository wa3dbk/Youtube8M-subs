00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640 
says for 2d now to D is the hex code for
brick<00:02:27.090> block<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.900> now<00:02:28.200> you're<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:28.410> going<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
brick block so now you're just going to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.070 
brick block so now you're just going to
look<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:30.060> search<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.810> 2d<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.930> gonna

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
look around and search for 2d it's gonna

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.300 
look around and search for 2d it's gonna
be<00:02:34.200> somewhere<00:02:34.470> around<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.950> won't<00:02:35.040> always

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
be somewhere around here it won't always

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.460 
be somewhere around here it won't always
be<00:02:35.460> in<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.850> same<00:02:36.000> line<00:02:36.240> but<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:36.960> this<00:02:37.110> case<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
be in the same line but in this case it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.880 
be in the same line but in this case it
was<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:38.030> backspace<00:02:39.030> A<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.390> D<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.810> replace<00:02:40.770> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
was just backspace A to D and replace it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.020 
was just backspace A to D and replace it
with<00:02:40.920> 2e<00:02:42.830> because<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.460> hex<00:02:44.730> code<00:02:45.000> for

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
with 2e because that is the hex code for

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.050 
with 2e because that is the hex code for
TNT<00:02:46.819> now<00:02:47.819> we're<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:47.970> gonna<00:02:48.090> click<00:02:48.330> done<00:02:50.060> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
TNT now we're just gonna click done and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.780 
TNT now we're just gonna click done and
then<00:02:51.210> close

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.849 

it'll<00:03:00.120> probably<00:03:00.269> crash<00:03:00.659> it's<00:03:00.959> alright<00:03:02.569> and

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
it'll probably crash it's alright and

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:15.250 
it'll probably crash it's alright and
then<00:03:04.859> close<00:03:05.430> minecraft<00:03:07.549> open<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.609> back<00:03:08.730> up

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.559 

then<00:03:16.519> start<00:03:17.519> your<00:03:17.700> world<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.359> just

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
then start your world that you just

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.619 
then start your world that you just
inserted<00:03:18.900> TNT<00:03:19.409> into<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.269> then<00:03:21.269> BAM<00:03:21.450> you've

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
inserted TNT into and then BAM you've

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.920 
inserted TNT into and then BAM you've
got<00:03:21.810> TNT<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:25.470> works<00:03:25.739> by<00:03:26.040> holding<00:03:26.939> on<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.269> like

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
got TNT it works by holding on it like

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.660 
got TNT it works by holding on it like
you're<00:03:28.079> trying<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.409> destroy<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.980> that'll<00:03:29.519> set

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
you're trying to destroy it that'll set

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.929 
you're trying to destroy it that'll set
it<00:03:29.790> off<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:34.560> blows<00:03:34.859> up<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.189> everything<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:35.790> can

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
it off it blows up and everything it can

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
it off it blows up and everything it can
hurt<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:37.739> regular<00:03:37.980> TNT<00:03:38.959> it

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
hurt you it's just like regular TNT it

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.550 
hurt you it's just like regular TNT it
becomes<00:03:40.379> uh<00:03:40.790> it's<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:42.049> becomes<00:03:43.049> physics

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
becomes uh it's like becomes physics

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.349 
becomes uh it's like becomes physics
enabled<00:03:44.720> once<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.870> click<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.109> and<00:03:46.409> then<00:03:47.359> you

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
enabled once you click it and then you

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.119 
enabled once you click it and then you
can<00:03:48.540> go<00:03:48.840> back<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.290> if<00:03:49.379> you<00:03:49.500> use<00:03:49.829> up<00:03:49.859> all<00:03:50.099> the

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
can go back to it if you use up all the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.679 
can go back to it if you use up all the
slots<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.579> your<00:03:50.669> inventory<00:03:50.909> unlike<00:03:51.540> the

previous version let's click the blank

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.440 
previous version let's click the blank
space<00:03:55.620> where<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:58.669> brick<00:03:59.669> block<00:03:59.909> used<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.299> be

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
space where the brick block used to be

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.869 
space where the brick block used to be
and<00:04:01.280> that's<00:04:02.280> basically<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
and that's basically it
