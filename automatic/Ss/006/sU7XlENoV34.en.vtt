00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.570

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.109
 I will say another fantastic card 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.680
 whose name is alan aion what in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 translation 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.939
 island own and I think that by name already 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 it is clear that this map is located 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.269
 island this island is just shocking 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.119
 to its scale 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.890
 but the island has an amusement park in 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 which is absolutely everything 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.719
 giving up but up the roller coaster up 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 water park and many many many things 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.290
 Today we will tell you everything in it. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.510
 there is on this map on this island and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.670
 I'll show you well let's get into view 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.940
 first person 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 so turn off all this unnecessary and the first 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.370
 we appear on the roof of this 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.190
 Corncob aircraft in our hands were 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.140
 just four cards he also was 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 water bottle something else fishing pole 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.690
 compasses and pancake hours in general, all that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.300
 need for survival on the island to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 Compass clock is the most-most needed in these 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 maps was written 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 recommendation rule but I threw them out 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.500
 I began to read in general if you want 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 read more you can download 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 map and all as usual link to the map 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.090
 will be in the description so we say so 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 flew to this island we are with him 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 landed and went for a walk on it I 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 I think it will just be interesting 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 see what's on this island 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 Set aside for you and friends to play 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.329
 this card have fun run 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.220
 jump well what of there is like said 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.090
 here there is a casino but in general the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.960
 most things on the map 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.799
 that is, you can not with them 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 to interact 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.689
 and not automated most 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.759
 it's props just for the mind to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.200
 beauty example too casino in it 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.030
 absolutely nothing can be done 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.540
 just walk look over here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 the creeper hangs out apparently already dofiga dough 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.240
 cut down and went to the exit so the creeper 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 dofiga dough cut down went to the exit come on 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.750
 where to where to drink again 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 again for a drink 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.409
 so please don't sizzle here to me 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.539
 don't sizzle all exit casino spiteful 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.430
 the creeper struck us drove here 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.650
 in fact it's what a Casino 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.659
 I think it costs four floors there too 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.150
 on top there is such a platform for 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.670
 rest, you can even say so here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.849
 such a pavel helicopter landed there 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.370
 there is a court with tennis 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.560
 there is a water slide that is well 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.540
 water park you can call it that but he doesn't 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.319
 so great as I would like here 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.040
 there is just the rise of these 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.139
 waterslides 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 This I understand a big slope water 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.120
 slides you can ride on it 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.579
 probably dad because there is no 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.379
 chests with a boat but I think if desired 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.959
 you can take from creativity and just 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.609
 ride like this 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.019
 friends can compete also 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.150
 there is a roller coaster here they are 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.010
 nearby are so 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.930
 some kind of small about the camp and not because 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.060
 the fact that the card is loaded is very, very 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.099
 big lot on it all sorts of buildings 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.349
 so maybe a little jerk here 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.909
 these roller coasters pass just 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.030
 under the epic places under the vines under 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.790
 splits 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.579
 mountains in the gorge in all sorts that is very 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.409
 cool gave way paved so I 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.959
 I think that your friends will be interested 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.579
 ride here also is here by 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.799
 my residential complex if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:27.389
 yes here it is a residential complex and where are you 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:30.280
 you can say so damn spend the night 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.750
 to get away from the mobs somehow and they 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.090
 there is a bed yes there is a bed 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.069
 a chest but for some reason they know the wilderness 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.169
 why can it be here also 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.150
 survive I think it is quite real 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.010
 let's try to ride on 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.389
 roller coaster because principle 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.579
 as he said there is nothing special to do 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.810
 here and from the items with which you can 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.569
 interact it only 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.549
 roller coaster water slide and here 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.989
 there is a carousel there by the way let's 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.810
 fly there I did not show you 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.909
 there are carousels and wheel consideration 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.939
 views damn I call him two 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.970
 words here it is damn well, in principle 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.780
 everything is done just fine the same 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.310
 there are such small ones here 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.169
 shops in which opportunities 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.600
 to bargain with the residents buy them 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.610
 something damn 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.590
 from some moisture it is not clear why 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.600
 let's take a ride on the roller coaster 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.020
 I think that basically in principle here 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.970
 there is nothing more to show if you 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.530
 come in you download the map and fly 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.510
 look at it yourself 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.010
 I think it will be interesting to you no 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.840
 it looks like we can't do it 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.640
 ride on a roller coaster because 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.540
 that i started off just hard la and 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.340
 for some reason for about 4 minutes on 5 games 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.620
 this map I start lags not me 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.150
 I tried to shoot all the other cards all 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 Normally there was no lag but for some reason 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.120
 it is on this map that lags begin 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.990
 5 minute 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.640
 so I think that's all worth it. 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.900
 to complete the issue because I just donâ€™t 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.320
 I can shoot with these logs 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.870
 I'm trying to remove probably 20 times already 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.400
 map 20 times already trying they tell 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.920
 and all can not get it 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.880
 try restart maybe this 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.020
 will save the situation listen to the rescue 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.620
 let's still you up for a ride on 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.990
 trolley 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.040
 we can do that honestly 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.650
 saying don't know where the beginning 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.070
 there she is somewhere but we take a ride from here 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.720
 in the middle I had an empty time to eat 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.510
 here are here roller coaster 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.150
 very cool so let's go let's go 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.990
 so land down there even have room for 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.810
 transplants 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.870
 very cool so let's go on 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.570
 there is a sign ki it was about all sat down and 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.270
 let's go let's go so vines do not hear 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.120
 look very cool epic to me in 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.860
 principle like these roller coasters 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.080
 so it seems to me let's have a little more 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.480
 we pass and while here we go I'll 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.460
 quietly wrap up in general then i 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.050
 I think that this is all the cards I showed you 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.870

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.870
