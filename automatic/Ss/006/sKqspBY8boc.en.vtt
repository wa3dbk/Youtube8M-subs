00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
it again

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.469 
it again
okay<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.310> only<00:02:04.580> one<00:02:04.759> of<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.149> have<00:02:05.330> to

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479

okay so only one of you you have to
sledgehammer<00:02:05.750> behind<00:02:06.380> someone<00:02:06.770> someone<00:02:07.280> to

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
sledgehammer behind someone someone to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.670 
sledgehammer behind someone someone to
south<00:02:07.789> we<00:02:08.270> kind<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.599> want<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.750> sledgehammer

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.950 

see<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.640> run<00:02:13.850> run<00:02:14.060> run<00:02:14.240> oh<00:02:16.570> ok<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:17.630> what's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
see and I run run run oh ok so what's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.840 
see and I run run run oh ok so what's
the<00:02:18.110> best<00:02:18.260> strategy<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.860> not<00:02:19.280> dying<00:02:19.550> right

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the best strategy for not dying right

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.330 
the best strategy for not dying right
away<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.630> there<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.440> no<00:02:21.620> real<00:02:21.860> best<00:02:22.070> friend

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
away so there is no real best friend

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.650 
away so there is no real best friend
you're<00:02:22.520> not<00:02:22.670> dying<00:02:22.940> right<00:02:23.150> away<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.450> best

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
you're not dying right away the best

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.290 
you're not dying right away the best
strategy<00:02:24.080> there<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.620> training<00:02:25.240> sort<00:02:26.240> of

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
strategy there is is training sort of

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.620 
strategy there is is training sort of
understanding<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> way<00:02:26.990> everything<00:02:27.530> works

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
understanding the way everything works

are not used to road lights or top-down

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.550 
are not used to road lights or top-down
shooters<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.599> going<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> be<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> really<00:02:54.440> rough

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
shooters it's going to be a really rough

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.710 
shooters it's going to be a really rough
time<00:02:54.800> but<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.640> every<00:02:55.940> glamour<00:02:56.180> game<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
time but like every glamour game the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.449 
time but like every glamour game the
systems<00:02:57.170> are<00:02:57.319> simple<00:02:57.560> they're<00:02:58.010> easy<00:02:58.220> to

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
systems are simple they're easy to

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.580 
systems are simple they're easy to
understand<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.900> that<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.349> will<00:03:00.440> have

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
understand it's just that you will have

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.960 
understand it's just that you will have
to<00:03:00.739> get<00:03:00.860> better<00:03:01.040> at<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.730> want<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
to get better at them if you want to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.670 
to get better at them if you want to
progress<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.569> game<00:03:02.599> so<00:03:03.319> there's<00:03:03.500> going<00:03:03.620> to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
progress in the game so there's going to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.610 
progress in the game so there's going to
be<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.830> really<00:03:04.220> large<00:03:04.430> enemy<00:03:04.670> in<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.090> level<00:03:05.620> so

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
be a really large enemy in this level so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.320 
be a really large enemy in this level so
when<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.920> big<00:03:07.130> enemy<00:03:07.310> shows<00:03:07.670> up<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> best

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
when the big enemy shows up the best

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.910 
when the big enemy shows up the best
strategy<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:08.959> just<00:03:09.290> run<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.799> other

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
strategy is to just run to the other

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
strategy is to just run to the other
side<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.400> level<00:03:10.730> oh<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:15.620> was<00:03:15.849> that<00:03:16.849> was
