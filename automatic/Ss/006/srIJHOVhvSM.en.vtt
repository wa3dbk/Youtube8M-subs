00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.519
 glass panel stairs 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.320
 with those were enough to use 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.780
 these great block dinners that they want 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.590
 actually well the first thing we have 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.899
 what to do because these two stairs like this 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.070
 as I do not know how to say it and so the same 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.320
 equally 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.050
 we put around 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.810
 they saw that it remains as a kind of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.810
 hole because this should not be 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.860
 that's why this goes like this 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.729
 bird 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.940
 you have to come here as well as that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.940
 glued 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:10.400
 it has to be one more left good 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.400

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.330
 with a mirror ok but look what I say 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.700
 they just saw that it looks like this 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.590
 sort out and that's what you have to 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.480
 then put the water 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.909
 already already already 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.040
 and we see that there is a space that does not 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:36.110
 I need you to worry 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.570
 so to speak but something 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.750
 here you can cover it with the block 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.630
 who would want either if they have a house 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.960
 modern 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.670
 that I love making modern houses 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.240
 I do not know any of you put in the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:57.020
 comments if they know 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:01.860
 and they know how to make modern houses that's 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.710
 modern music not rustic but modern 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.620
 rustic and you will put together the third 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:12.650
 world by modern erotic houses 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.050
 is what I'm saying good I do not know the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.350
 fact that they've already seen that it's 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.170
 excuse me the fact that you already saw that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.610
 is normal and this is when we throw 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.160
 the fish for here 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.220
 has to fall exactly in 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.610
 the bus of the stairs that makes 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.610
 jump 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.120

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.940

 they jump and they laugh and you see if you want 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.410
 improve it with I do not know what it's called 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.770
 I do not know how to say it with 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.210
 a circuit in the rest I did not leave a 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.450
 circuit of the rest not everything 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.380

 a super house for
