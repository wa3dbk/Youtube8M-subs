hello I'm Andrew we're friends like TV
we're<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.850> make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> quick<00:00:03.659> blender

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
we're going to make a quick blender

tutorial how to wait pain the mesh to

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.499 
tutorial how to wait pain the mesh to
the<00:00:07.620> armature<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.460> you've<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.940> armature<00:00:12.450> on

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the armature so you've got armature on

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.829 
the armature so you've got armature on
you've<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> mesh<00:00:13.370> go<00:00:14.370> select<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.000> mesh<00:00:15.240> if

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
you've got a mesh go select the mesh if

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.410 
you've got a mesh go select the mesh if
you<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.350> already<00:00:16.820> select<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> armature<00:00:18.060> an

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
you have already select the armature an

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.980 
you have already select the armature an
object<00:00:18.750> node<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.460> our<00:00:20.460> space<00:00:20.850> make<00:00:22.400> erin

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
object node and our space make erin

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
object node and our space make erin
click<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.890> want<00:00:26.070> automatic<00:00:26.609> weights

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
click that and we want automatic weights

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
click that and we want automatic weights
this<00:00:28.519> makes<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.760> automatic<00:00:30.359> weights<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this makes some automatic weights to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.250 
this makes some automatic weights to
your<00:00:31.320> mesh<00:00:31.800> already<00:00:32.510> but<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.809> you'll<00:00:34.079> see

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
your mesh already but as you'll see

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.720 
your mesh already but as you'll see
there<00:00:34.469> won't<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.710> quite<00:00:34.920> right<00:00:35.190> what<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.670> want

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
there won't be quite right what you want

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
there won't be quite right what you want
once<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> loads<00:00:40.250> okay

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
once it loads okay

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
once it loads okay
so<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.360> already<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> move<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.410> mesh

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so it's already me to move to the mesh

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.020 
so it's already me to move to the mesh
into<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.149> good<00:00:45.149> position<00:00:45.300> alignment<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.379> M

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
into a good position alignment to the M

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.209 
into a good position alignment to the M
armature<00:00:48.680> but<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.190> go<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.809> select<00:00:51.809> mesh

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
armature but if I go into select mesh

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.139 
armature but if I go into select mesh
I'm<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.550> house<00:00:53.789> mode<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.850> move<00:00:56.850> my

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I'm going to house mode and I move my

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.099 
I'm going to house mode and I move my
arm<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.710> kind<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> moves<00:00:59.760> under<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> arm<00:01:00.780> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
arm it kind of moves under the arm it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.899 
arm it kind of moves under the arm it
like<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> arm<00:01:02.489> goes<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.899> shouldn't<00:01:04.260> do

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
like the arm goes in how it shouldn't do

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
like the arm goes in how it shouldn't do
so<00:01:06.200> that's<00:01:07.200> where<00:01:07.439> weight<00:01:07.680> painting<00:01:08.130> comes<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so that's where weight painting comes in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.770 
so that's where weight painting comes in
and<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.000> keep<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.270> mode<00:01:12.510> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and if I go to I keep in this mode I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.130 
and if I go to I keep in this mode I
select<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.240> mesh<00:01:16.009> go<00:01:17.009> into<00:01:17.280> weight<00:01:18.030> paint<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
select my mesh go into weight paint down

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.230 
select my mesh go into weight paint down
there<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.900> as<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> kept<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.580> pose

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
there and now as if you kept it in pose

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.800 
there and now as if you kept it in pose
mode<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.840> select<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.350> mesh<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.420> should

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
mode and select the mesh then you should

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.760 
mode and select the mesh then you should
see<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.770> like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> click<00:01:30.770> each

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
see it like this and you can click each

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.690 
see it like this and you can click each
part<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> bone<00:01:32.880> it'll<00:01:33.150> show<00:01:34.189> which<00:01:35.189> part<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
part the bone it'll show which part of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.210 
part the bone it'll show which part of
the<00:01:35.790> mesh<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.420> controls<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.040> where

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the mesh it controls and that's where

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
the mesh it controls and that's where
the<00:01:38.280> problem<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> because<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.170> here

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the problem is because I just see here

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.490 
the problem is because I just see here
this<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> bone<00:01:41.360> controls<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.290> under

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
this bit of the bone controls the under

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
this bit of the bone controls the under
arm<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> around<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.180> which<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
arm here and around there which it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
arm here and around there which it
shouldn't<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> should

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
shouldn't really do which is that should

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
shouldn't really do which is that should
you<00:01:47.070> take<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.729> part<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.810> controls

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you take on this part which controls

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
you take on this part which controls
over<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.920> which<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> makes<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.670> going<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
over here which it makes you're going to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
over here which it makes you're going to
do<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.780> weight<00:01:55.560> paint

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
do as well so you got you weight paint

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.719 
do as well so you got you weight paint
tools<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.920> you're<00:01:58.920> mostly<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> use

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
tools and you're mostly going to use

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.270 
tools and you're mostly going to use
blur<00:02:00.060> add<00:02:01.040> subtract<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
blur add subtract and that's it so the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.510 
blur add subtract and that's it so the
free<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.409> click<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.429> image

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
free here you just click on the image

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.080 
free here you just click on the image
now<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> bring<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.330> up

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
now to bring them up

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
now to bring them up
and<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.600> show<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.110> side

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and I'm just going to show you one side

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.230 
and I'm just going to show you one side
you<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.070> on<00:02:14.250> both<00:02:14.370> sides<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:15.000> don't

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
you have to this on both sides I don't

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800 
you have to this on both sides I don't
know<00:02:15.330> if<00:02:15.390> there's<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.960> mirroring<00:02:16.830> it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
know if there's a way of mirroring it

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.520 
know if there's a way of mirroring it
across<00:02:18.810> ahem<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.930> side<00:02:21.930> slipped<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
across ahem but side slipped on the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.850 
across ahem but side slipped on the
shoulder<00:02:22.830> bone<00:02:23.540> subtract<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.790> try<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
shoulder bone subtract and try if you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.920 
shoulder bone subtract and try if you
check<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.850> all<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.330> things<00:02:30.360> out<00:02:30.720> here

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
check this all the right things out here

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.790

and try and get rid of any parts that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.830 
and try and get rid of any parts that
are<00:02:39.870> colored<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> shouldn't<00:02:42.600> because

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
are colored that it shouldn't because

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.280 
are colored that it shouldn't because
the<00:02:43.200> colored<00:02:43.470> parts<00:02:43.860> other<00:02:44.220> parts<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.290> are

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the colored parts other parts that are

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:59.040 
the colored parts other parts that are
going<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.770> be<00:02:47.040> moved<00:02:47.760> by<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.209> bone

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.960 

okay<00:02:59.830> now<00:02:59.950> let<00:03:00.070> me<00:03:00.100> check<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.460> movement<00:03:00.850> you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
okay now let me check out movement you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.960 
okay now let me check out movement you
can<00:03:01.150> do<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.950> still<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.220> mode<00:03:03.430> as<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.850> it

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
can do this still in this mode as if it

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.170 
can do this still in this mode as if it
was<00:03:04.120> in<00:03:04.150> pose<00:03:04.750> mode<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:06.310> press<00:03:06.520> G<00:03:06.880> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
was in pose mode so you can press G and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.910 
was in pose mode so you can press G and
move<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.470> party<00:03:08.890> one<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:10.530> that's<00:03:11.530> looking

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
move the party one and that's looking

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.500 
move the party one and that's looking
okay<00:03:12.280> apart<00:03:12.640> from<00:03:12.850> down<00:03:13.540> there<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:18.510> shoulder

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
okay apart from down there the shoulder

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.470 
okay apart from down there the shoulder
seemed<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:22.270> move<00:03:22.480> yep<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.730> go<00:03:24.730> find<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.210> part

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
seemed to move yep so go find the part

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.110 
seemed to move yep so go find the part
that<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:27.040> moving<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.820> just<00:03:28.030> rub<00:03:29.610> away<00:03:30.610> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:45.410 

weight<00:03:37.590> single<00:03:39.180> casting<00:03:41.100> G<00:03:42.870> okay

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
weight single casting G okay

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.380 
weight single casting G okay
I'd<00:03:46.420> say<00:03:46.870> that's<00:03:47.050> okay<00:03:47.440> for<00:03:47.710> mine<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:49.060> rest<00:03:49.240> of

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
I'd say that's okay for mine the rest of

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.340 
I'd say that's okay for mine the rest of
the<00:03:49.450> movement<00:03:49.660> there<00:03:50.530> would<00:03:50.800> be<00:03:50.830> because<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
the movement there would be because of

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.150 
the movement there would be because of
the<00:03:53.350> movement<00:03:53.710> from<00:03:53.920> this<00:03:54.070> part<00:03:54.400> which<00:03:54.640> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the movement from this part which is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.830 
the movement from this part which is
stretching<00:03:57.160> way<00:03:57.310> too<00:03:57.370> far<00:03:57.700> down<00:03:57.850> so<00:03:58.150> continue

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
stretching way too far down so continue

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.720 
stretching way too far down so continue
to<00:03:58.990> use<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.470> subtract<00:04:00.130> tool<00:04:05.430> okay<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.490> I'll

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
to use the subtract tool okay so I'll

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.640 
to use the subtract tool okay so I'll
see<00:04:06.910> how<00:04:07.060> good<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.360> ice<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:08.040> spin<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:13.650> that's

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
see how good the ice I spin and that's

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.190 
see how good the ice I spin and that's
not<00:04:14.890> looking<00:04:15.100> too<00:04:15.250> bad<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:17.440> obviously<00:04:19.200> do

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
not looking too bad you can obviously do

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.350 
not looking too bad you can obviously do
different<00:04:20.799> yourself<00:04:21.220> I'm<00:04:21.489> basically<00:04:22.060> showing

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
different yourself I'm basically showing

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.290 
different yourself I'm basically showing
you<00:04:22.600> what<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:22.870> could<00:04:23.410> do<00:04:23.820> not<00:04:24.820> spending<00:04:25.150> much

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
you what you could do not spending much

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.200 
you what you could do not spending much
time<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.110> could<00:04:26.520> spend<00:04:27.520> more<00:04:27.730> time<00:04:27.790> I'm

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
time on it I could spend more time I'm

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.370 
time on it I could spend more time I'm
using<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.540> blur<00:04:28.690> tool<00:04:28.900> right<00:04:29.080> now<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:30.390> merge<00:04:31.390> as

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
using a blur tool right now to merge as

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.550 
using a blur tool right now to merge as
soon<00:04:32.620> as<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.830> see<00:04:32.980> if<00:04:33.070> I<00:04:33.130> click<00:04:33.370> more<00:04:33.670> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
soon as you see if I click more the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.560 
soon as you see if I click more the
color<00:04:35.560> spread<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:37.170> so<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.800> deeper<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.220> color

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
color spread and so the deeper the color

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.970 
color spread and so the deeper the color
in<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.870> center<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.700> mean<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.850> controls

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
in the center that I mean it controls

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.490 
in the center that I mean it controls
the<00:04:44.980> arm<00:04:45.220> even<00:04:45.730> more<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.960> position<00:04:47.140> then

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
the arm even more and that position then

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.050 
the arm even more and that position then
slowly<00:04:47.980> less<00:04:48.600> until<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:49.690> gets<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:51.060> dark

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060
