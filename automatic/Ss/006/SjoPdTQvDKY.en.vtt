 The good part of the contract is 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.910
 One contract 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.350
 One of the new Day 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.740
 It is to be able to use various terminals 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.090
 It you are using where are is do things that feel natural. However other companies 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.750
 Then, that kind of thing is not done so much 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.750
 For example, this 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.310

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.000
 Also I i-mode 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.150

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.510
 You can use sp mode 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.620
 Of course we can do verse now 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.620
 Because it is a voice contract 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.569
 further 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.239
 Have data 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.569
 Since the voice contract but sp mode is attached 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.349

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.260

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.740
 In this way 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.040
 It is a terminal of Crossy 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:32.680
 The case will be 3g connection though 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.680
 It is possible to use to love to say this 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.030
 Because it can be used freely like this 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.689
 On the contrary 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:53.110
 Docomo system if you stick bullets of data terminal or smart 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:56.370

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.750
 Just maa sp mode or i mode 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:05.270
 DoCoMo own art it is possible to say Zurab to only net I'd not be used 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.270
 Of course 4 verses become possible too
