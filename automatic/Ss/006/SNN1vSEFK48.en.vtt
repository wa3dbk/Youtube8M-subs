doesn't<00:00:16.859> actually<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.520> long<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.910> build

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
doesn't actually take that long to build

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.170 
doesn't actually take that long to build
its<00:00:19.320> pretty<00:00:19.680> pretty<00:00:20.070> simple<00:00:20.310> build<00:00:20.699> actually

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
its pretty pretty simple build actually

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.599 
its pretty pretty simple build actually
does<00:00:22.050> come<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.500> three<00:00:22.710> instruction<00:00:23.220> manuals

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
does come with three instruction manuals

does come with three instruction manuals
one<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.560> car<00:00:25.560> itself<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> wind

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
one for the car itself one for the wind

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.179 
one for the car itself one for the wind
turbine<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.260> for<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> truck<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> truck

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
turbine and one for the truck the truck

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
turbine and one for the truck the truck
obviously<00:00:29.849> being<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.689> longest<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
obviously being the longest thing to

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.659 
obviously being the longest thing to
build<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> wind<00:00:31.769> turbine<00:00:32.070> itself<00:00:32.219> actually

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
build the wind turbine itself actually

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.420 
build the wind turbine itself actually
is<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.260> short<00:00:34.469> build<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.950> doesn't<00:00:35.250> take

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is a really short build it doesn't take

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
is a really short build it doesn't take
very<00:00:35.460> long<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.840> not<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> whole<00:00:37.230> lot

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to it as far as the build goes um let's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.270 
to it as far as the build goes um let's
take<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> minifigures<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
take a look at the minifigures here so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
take a look at the minifigures here so
first<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.850> your<00:00:45.030> basic<00:00:45.750> city<00:00:46.379> driver<00:00:47.600> um

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
first you have your basic city driver um

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.750 
first you have your basic city driver um
Peters<00:00:49.590> comes<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> basic<00:00:50.430> overalls<00:00:51.090> and

Peters comes with the basic overalls and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
Peters comes with the basic overalls and
you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.690> basic<00:00:54.930> figure<00:00:55.379> actually

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you know pretty basic figure actually

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
you know pretty basic figure actually
you<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.460> he<00:00:56.579> seemed<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.300> from<00:00:57.449> a

thing<00:01:59.880> spins<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:02.280> made<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.909> piece

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
thing spins but this made this piece

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
thing spins but this made this piece
moves<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.700> annoying<00:02:05.700> if

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
moves which is kind of annoying if

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109

you're<00:02:06.750> trying<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.550> spin<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:08.970> then

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you're trying to spin this because then

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.660 
you're trying to spin this because then
it's<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.360> always<00:02:09.720> moves<00:02:09.959> too<00:02:10.370> but<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.489> does

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
it's not always moves too but it does

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.840 
it's not always moves too but it does
work<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.209> know

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
work you know

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.130 
work you know
it's<00:02:14.850> pretty<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:15.390> cool<00:02:15.720> they<00:02:16.080> do

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's pretty it's pretty cool they do

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.410 
it's pretty it's pretty cool they do
Bend<00:02:16.530> too<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.250> neat<00:02:20.820> feature

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
Bend too so it is a really neat feature

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.020 
Bend too so it is a really neat feature
and<00:02:22.380> then<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.650> side<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.100> says<00:02:23.280> octan

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.530 
and then on the side it says octan
energy<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.290> same<00:02:26.280> company<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> used

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
energy so it's same company like I used

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.080 
energy so it's same company like I used

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
you can actually I don't know if that's

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.780 
you can actually I don't know if that's
the<00:04:01.380> point<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.740> its<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.980> extend<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.430> trailer

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
the point of its to extend the trailer

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.370 
the point of its to extend the trailer
at<00:04:02.910> all<00:04:03.050> but<00:04:04.070> um<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:06.600> don't<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.960> don't<00:04:07.020> know<00:04:07.290> if

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
at all but um I I don't I don't know if

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.000 
at all but um I I don't I don't know if
you<00:04:07.470> have<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.830> do<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.130> or<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:10.010> just

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
you have to do that or not but just

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.400 
you have to do that or not but just
stick<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.160> back<00:04:11.460> on

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
stick that back on

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.100 
stick that back on
and<00:04:13.220> when<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.430> take<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.730> trailer<00:04:14.090> off<00:04:14.300> often

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
and when you take the trailer off often

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.030 
and when you take the trailer off often
this<00:04:16.100> piece<00:04:16.370> comes<00:04:16.670> off<00:04:16.820> too<00:04:17.770> so<00:04:18.770> you<00:04:18.830> have<00:04:18.950> to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
this piece comes off too so you have to

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.620 
this piece comes off too so you have to
watch<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:21.550> there<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:23.480> I'll<00:04:23.630> just<00:04:23.840> take<00:04:25.630> take

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
watch that there and I'll just take take

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.510 
watch that there and I'll just take take
these<00:04:26.840> off<00:04:27.080> take<00:04:27.590> little<00:04:27.920> blades<00:04:28.160> off<00:04:28.340> and

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
these off take little blades off and

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.390 
these off take little blades off and
show<00:04:28.640> you<00:04:28.700> how<00:04:28.880> they<00:04:29.030> go<00:04:29.180> on<00:04:29.980> I'm<00:04:30.980> not<00:04:31.160> going<00:04:31.340> to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
show you how they go on I'm not going to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
show you how they go on I'm not going to
show<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.730> other<00:04:31.850> two<00:04:31.910> parts<00:04:32.330> because

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
show you the other two parts because

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.610 
show you the other two parts because
you're<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.690> little<00:04:32.870> bit<00:04:32.960> more<00:04:33.110> difficult<00:04:33.590> to

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
you're a little bit more difficult to

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.970 
you're a little bit more difficult to
get<00:04:33.800> off<00:04:33.950> or<00:04:34.280> though<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:35.470> motors<00:04:36.470> not<00:04:36.680> but

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
get off or though and the motors not but

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.970 
get off or though and the motors not but
this<00:04:37.250> these<00:04:38.120> these<00:04:38.750> blades<00:04:39.110> are<00:04:39.320> probably<00:04:39.830> one

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
this these these blades are probably one

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.270 
this these these blades are probably one
of<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.130> easier<00:04:40.340> things<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.670> get<00:04:40.820> off<00:04:42.280> it's

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
of the easier things to get off it's

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.680 
of the easier things to get off it's
really<00:04:43.340> just<00:04:43.580> sticking<00:04:44.000> right<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.360> that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.860 

just<00:04:47.690> clicks<00:04:48.020> right<00:04:48.230> in<00:04:51.520> there<00:04:52.520> yeah<00:04:52.700> okay<00:04:53.330> so

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
just clicks right in there yeah okay so

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.910 
just clicks right in there yeah okay so
I'll<00:04:53.960> show<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:55.990> how<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.260> looks<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.650> middle

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
I'll show you how that looks the middle

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.800 
I'll show you how that looks the middle
one<00:04:58.040> does<00:04:58.250> have<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.490> little<00:04:58.610> bit<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.880> movement

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
one does have a little bit of movement

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.590 
one does have a little bit of movement
but<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.830> two<00:05:00.950> on<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.190> sides<00:05:01.430> stay<00:05:02.300> where<00:05:02.480> they

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
but the two on the sides stay where they

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.420 
but the two on the sides stay where they
are

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
are

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.300 
are
last<00:05:04.430> but<00:05:04.610> not<00:05:04.640> least<00:05:05.060> we<00:05:05.960> have<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.680> little

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
last but not least we have the little

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.260 
last but not least we have the little
car<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:09.710> position<00:05:10.220> perfectly<00:05:13.030> guys<00:05:14.030> all<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
car this position perfectly guys all the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.980 
car this position perfectly guys all the
way<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:16.550> point<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.240> truck<00:05:17.450> is<00:05:17.630> you

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
way so the point of the truck is you

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.890 
way so the point of the truck is you
know<00:05:18.110> whenever<00:05:18.290> you<00:05:18.440> see<00:05:18.590> like<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:19.900> oversized

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
know whenever you see like a oversized

know whenever you see like a oversized
load<00:05:21.170> truck<00:05:21.470> or<00:05:21.590> whatever<00:05:21.740> they<00:05:21.950> always<00:05:22.190> have

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
load truck or whatever they always have

load truck or whatever they always have
these<00:05:22.490> trucks<00:05:22.730> that<00:05:22.910> drive<00:05:23.030> in<00:05:23.240> front<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:24.050> the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
these trucks that drive in front and the

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.660 
these trucks that drive in front and the
little<00:05:24.260> flashy<00:05:24.620> board<00:05:24.980> comes<00:05:25.160> up<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.490> back

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
little flashy board comes up in the back

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.010 
little flashy board comes up in the back

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
people there's an oversized load truck

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.940 
people there's an oversized load truck
coming<00:05:28.910> behind<00:05:29.290> because<00:05:30.290> usually<00:05:30.440> they<00:05:30.740> take

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
coming behind because usually they take

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.400 
coming behind because usually they take
up<00:05:31.130> one<00:05:31.370> or<00:05:31.400> two<00:05:31.520> lanes<00:05:32.290> doesn't<00:05:33.290> have<00:05:33.380> a

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
up one or two lanes doesn't have a

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.920 
up one or two lanes doesn't have a
little<00:05:33.500> license<00:05:33.950> plate<00:05:34.130> stick<00:05:34.400> to<00:05:34.520> their<00:05:35.890> that

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
little license plate stick to their that

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.480 
little license plate stick to their that
and<00:05:38.930> it<00:05:39.080> actually<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.740> set<00:05:40.010> number<00:05:40.160> I

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
and it actually is the set number I

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.770 
and it actually is the set number I
don't<00:05:40.790> know<00:05:40.880> if<00:05:40.970> anybody<00:05:41.330> else<00:05:41.420> notice<00:05:41.750> that

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
don't know if anybody else notice that

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.930 
don't know if anybody else notice that
seven<00:05:42.710> seven<00:05:42.950> four<00:05:43.070> sevens<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.580> set<00:05:43.790> number

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
seven seven four sevens the set number

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.730 
seven seven four sevens the set number
so<00:05:44.720> I<00:05:44.750> thought<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.140> was<00:05:45.230> a<00:05:45.290> neat<00:05:45.560> little

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
so I thought that was a neat little

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.000 
so I thought that was a neat little
thing<00:05:46.250> um<00:05:47.230> neat<00:05:48.230> little<00:05:48.350> thing<00:05:48.620> in<00:05:48.710> there<00:05:48.830> and

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
thing um neat little thing in there and

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.190 
thing um neat little thing in there and
then<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:50.180> can<00:05:50.330> put<00:05:50.480> the<00:05:50.570> engineer<00:05:50.990> in<00:05:51.050> here

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
then you can put the engineer in here

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.380 
then you can put the engineer in here
which<00:05:51.320> is<00:05:51.470> nice<00:05:51.650> because<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.760> one<00:05:52.910> benefit<00:05:53.270> of

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
which is nice because the one benefit of

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.880 
which is nice because the one benefit of
two<00:05:53.540> figures<00:05:53.840> is<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.140> can<00:05:54.290> actually<00:05:54.560> fit

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
two figures is you can actually fit

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.410 
two figures is you can actually fit
there's<00:05:55.160> enough<00:05:55.340> vehicles<00:05:55.520> for<00:05:55.940> both<00:05:56.060> figures

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
there's enough vehicles for both figures

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.600 
there's enough vehicles for both figures
so<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:57.320> don't<00:05:57.500> have<00:05:57.590> like<00:05:57.800> extra<00:05:57.980> figures<00:05:58.490> you

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
so you don't have like extra figures you

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.800 
so you don't have like extra figures you
can<00:05:58.760> just<00:05:58.880> carry<00:05:59.090> in<00:05:59.180> your<00:05:59.210> pocket<00:05:59.630> you<00:05:59.720> can

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
can just carry in your pocket you can

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.160 
can just carry in your pocket you can
actually<00:06:00.140> use<00:06:00.950> them<00:06:01.100> both<00:06:01.400> up<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.690> find<00:06:02.990> a

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
quite quite wide so you know quite thick

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.820 
quite quite wide so you know quite thick
I<00:07:05.600> mean<00:07:06.730> it<00:07:07.730> was<00:07:08.000> a<00:07:08.030> modular<00:07:08.450> building<00:07:08.870> it's

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
I mean it was a modular building it's

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.680 
I mean it was a modular building it's
really<00:07:10.040> nice<00:07:10.190> set<00:07:10.730> and<00:07:10.910> actually<00:07:11.360> went<00:07:11.510> down<00:07:11.570> I

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
really nice set and actually went down I

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.110 
really nice set and actually went down I
think<00:07:12.080> it<00:07:12.260> went<00:07:12.350> down<00:07:12.560> to<00:07:12.710> $30<00:07:13.430> before<00:07:13.880> it<00:07:13.940> sold

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
think it went down to $30 before it sold

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.360 
think it went down to $30 before it sold
out<00:07:14.270> so<00:07:14.330> it<00:07:14.630> would<00:07:14.720> have<00:07:14.780> been<00:07:14.900> a<00:07:15.010> great<00:07:16.010> great

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
out so it would have been a great great

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.340 
out so it would have been a great great
deal<00:07:16.550> hunter<00:07:16.970> trying<00:07:17.150> to<00:07:17.240> focus<00:07:17.390> there<00:07:17.720> would

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
deal hunter trying to focus there would

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.410 
deal hunter trying to focus there would
have<00:07:18.440> been<00:07:18.560> a<00:07:18.590> great<00:07:18.860> deal<00:07:19.070> to<00:07:19.520> get<00:07:19.640> it<00:07:19.730> for<00:07:19.880> $30

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420 
have been a great deal to get it for $30

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.820 
have been a great deal to get it for $30
but<00:07:20.450> I<00:07:20.810> don't<00:07:21.050> know<00:07:21.140> I<00:07:21.170> got<00:07:21.500> for<00:07:21.680> my<00:07:21.770> birthday

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
but I don't know I got for my birthday

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.260 
but I don't know I got for my birthday
so<00:07:22.160> I'm<00:07:22.340> not<00:07:22.520> sure<00:07:23.140> what<00:07:24.140> the<00:07:24.230> price<00:07:24.410> was<00:07:25.270> yeah

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
so I'm not sure what the price was yeah

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.270 
so I'm not sure what the price was yeah
and<00:07:26.630> the<00:07:26.960> reason<00:07:27.200> it<00:07:27.320> spins<00:07:27.620> if<00:07:27.830> any<00:07:27.980> of<00:07:28.100> your

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 
and the reason it spins if any of your

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.160 
and the reason it spins if any of your
wondering<00:07:28.610> is<00:07:28.820> because<00:07:29.150> it<00:07:29.720> pops<00:07:29.960> right<00:07:30.050> off

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.170 
wondering is because it pops right off

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.980 
wondering is because it pops right off
but<00:07:30.440> it<00:07:30.620> sits<00:07:30.890> on<00:07:31.510> sits<00:07:32.510> on<00:07:32.630> this<00:07:32.840> little

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
but it sits on sits on this little

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.710 
but it sits on sits on this little
spinny<00:07:33.380> piece<00:07:33.620> here<00:07:33.860> so<00:07:34.130> I'm<00:07:35.000> sure<00:07:35.300> there<00:07:35.450> you

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
spinny piece here so I'm sure there you

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.210 
spinny piece here so I'm sure there you
could<00:07:35.870> probably<00:07:36.080> fix<00:07:36.410> that<00:07:36.710> if<00:07:36.890> you<00:07:37.010> really

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220 
could probably fix that if you really

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.860 
could probably fix that if you really
cared<00:07:37.460> but<00:07:37.700> it's<00:07:37.940> just<00:07:38.030> gonna<00:07:38.240> be<00:07:38.390> going<00:07:38.690> on
