00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.660
 important 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.120
 First of all, I would like you to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.090

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.749
 in account very many already know that then 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.419
 well I will upload a few series of 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:21.550
 fifa kinder and I would like you to help me 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.769
 to decide, let's go here in the link 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.850
 in the description your vote counts 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.680
 very much and I will keep you in mind 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.690
 and the truth is that he has begun to do 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 the survey by twitter there are already 67 votes 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.510
 that are quite important to me already 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 you know that you are the channel part 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.150
 of the channel and your opinion 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 very much said this can be true 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.110
 we are in a pretty news 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.320
 important and that is that battlefield 5 is going to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.230
 be next year so it has proved 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 the director has said it without wanting 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 artistic of battlefield airlines that has 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 said that the game can coexist 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.859
 combat the freak 5 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.320
 The truth is that he has not said that he's going to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 be something that comes but if the game 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 part fix line goes out at the beginning of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.649
 next year and says they can 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.790
 coexist combat the end 5 that wants 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.039
 say that it is that she has in her 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.140
 plans to take out battlefield 5 the year that 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.869
 comes or in the next few months 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.450
 post-launch since it has been 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.430
 said that the first one is not a title 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 belonging to the hard core of the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 franchise to what is being homeland 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 field the normal water films then 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 the truth is that for 2005 it is a clear 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.149
 hint that the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.580
 truth is that at the moment there is no 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.920
 announced nothing beyond battlefield 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.979
 online but it was already said last year that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.600
 a toilet and five would need more extras 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.350
 more destruction that is more important 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.440
 more impressive but what I think 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.110
 especially with less points please 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 new more polished what is known to leave 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 so you will have a campaign with the 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.160
 perspective and thematic of a series of 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.680
 television and visceral games do not rule out 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.230
 the subject of chapters the truth is 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.570
 that we can sell the motorcycle out there 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.060
 I know I will not be falling into 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.580
 that subject I will not lose a penny 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.000
 for more than one chapter there will be people 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000
 if not 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.250
 so good this information that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.080
 we have our moments we will continue 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.220
 informing and as always very many 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.810
 thank you all for being there 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.800
 I like favorites and see you the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.800
