notes<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.370> want<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> confuse<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.150> seven

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
notes I want to confuse you it's seven

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.300 
notes I want to confuse you it's seven
letters<00:02:23.989> c<00:02:24.950> d<00:02:25.220> e<00:02:25.250> f<00:02:25.519> g<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:26.209> b<00:02:26.390> c<00:02:26.690> or<00:02:27.140> i<00:02:27.709> said<00:02:28.070> say<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
letters c d e f g a b c or i said say it

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.009 
letters c d e f g a b c or i said say it
again<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> C<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.300> a<00:02:29.330> repeat<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.989> first

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
again but the C is a repeat of the first

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.449 
again but the C is a repeat of the first
C<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.680> we're<00:02:30.800> not<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.100> count<00:02:31.250> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
C so we're not going to count that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.660 
C so we're not going to count that
letter<00:02:31.700> again<00:02:32.920> because<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.130> once<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.430> get<00:02:34.550> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
letter again because then once we get to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.130 
letter again because then once we get to
see<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.180> start<00:02:35.420> over<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.870> start

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
see we just start over and we start

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.680 
see we just start over and we start
counting<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.650> letters<00:02:36.920> again<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.910> one<00:02:38.450> two

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
counting the letters again so one two

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.320 
counting the letters again so one two
three<00:02:38.720> four<00:02:39.050> five<00:02:39.560> six<00:02:39.890> seven<00:02:40.250> seven<00:02:40.820> what<00:02:41.239> we

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
three four five six seven seven what we

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.460 
three four five six seven seven what we
call<00:02:41.540> scale<00:02:41.900> degrees<00:02:42.380> okay<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.720> C's<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.200> first

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
call scale degrees okay so C's the first

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.620 
call scale degrees okay so C's the first
scale<00:02:45.709> degree<00:02:45.739> these<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.790> second<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.360> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that we can use for any major scale I'm

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.720 
that we can use for any major scale I'm
going<00:03:15.439> to<00:03:15.500> show<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.799> formula<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.489> then

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
going to show you the formula and then

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.110 
going to show you the formula and then
we<00:03:16.819> can<00:03:16.969> play<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:18.189> you<00:03:19.189> know<00:03:19.310> five<00:03:19.549> flats<00:03:19.879> or

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
we can play in you know five flats or

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.179 
we can play in you know five flats or
six<00:03:20.329> flats<00:03:20.599> or<00:03:20.870> however<00:03:21.230> many<00:03:21.439> sharps<00:03:21.829> we<00:03:21.980> want

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
six flats or however many sharps we want

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.920 
six flats or however many sharps we want
as<00:03:22.340> long<00:03:22.730> as<00:03:22.849> we<00:03:22.939> use<00:03:22.969> this<00:03:23.269> formula<00:03:23.719> here's

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
as long as we use this formula here's

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.740 
as long as we use this formula here's
the<00:03:24.109> formula<00:03:24.409> when<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.099> go<00:03:25.219> from<00:03:25.340> C<00:03:25.639> to<00:03:25.670> D<00:03:25.819> it's

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the formula when you go from C to D it's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.149 
the formula when you go from C to D it's
called<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.109> whole<00:03:27.319> step<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:27.769> why<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> have<00:03:28.129> a

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
called a whole step that's why I have a

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.699 
called a whole step that's why I have a
W<00:03:28.579> there<00:03:28.819> okay<00:03:29.359> it's<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.079> whole<00:03:30.290> step<00:03:30.530> because

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
W there okay it's a whole step because

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.259 
W there okay it's a whole step because
we<00:03:31.010> go<00:03:31.129> from<00:03:31.310> one<00:03:31.519> letter<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.909> very<00:03:32.120> next

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
we go from one letter to the very next

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.379 
we go from one letter to the very next
letter<00:03:32.659> but<00:03:33.439> we<00:03:33.590> skip<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.099> note<00:03:34.220> in<00:03:34.400> between<00:03:34.819> so

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
letter but we skip a note in between so

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.539 
letter but we skip a note in between so
that's<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.659> whole<00:03:35.780> step<00:03:36.049> now<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.010> get<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
that's a whole step now to get to the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.849 
that's a whole step now to get to the
second<00:03:38.060> scale<00:03:38.419> degree<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> third<00:03:39.200> one<00:03:39.379> we

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
second scale degree to the third one we

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.119 
second scale degree to the third one we
have<00:03:40.010> another<00:03:40.340> whole<00:03:40.669> step<00:03:40.970> from<00:03:41.209> D<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.569> e<00:03:42.129> okay

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
have another whole step from D to e okay

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.159 
have another whole step from D to e okay
because<00:03:43.310> we<00:03:43.489> skip<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.090> D<00:03:44.239> sharp<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:44.870> see<00:03:45.109> you

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
because we skip the D sharp so see you

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.319 
because we skip the D sharp so see you
need<00:03:45.379> now<00:03:46.040> there's<00:03:46.519> what<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.819> call<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.030> natural

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
need now there's what we call a natural

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.959 
need now there's what we call a natural
half<00:03:47.900> step<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.439> piano<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:48.980> E<00:03:49.189> to<00:03:49.219> F<00:03:49.340> this

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
half step on the piano from E to F this

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:51.580 
half step on the piano from E to F this
is<00:03:50.030> why<00:03:50.329> all<00:03:50.540> instrumentalists<00:03:51.200> in<00:03:51.290> college

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
is why all instrumentalists in college

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.349 
is why all instrumentalists in college
have<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.859> take<00:03:52.040> piano<00:03:52.280> lessons<00:03:52.430> because<00:03:53.239> you

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
have to take piano lessons because you

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.270 
have to take piano lessons because you
can<00:03:53.540> see<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.019> distances<00:03:54.500> between<00:03:54.560> notes<00:03:54.889> so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
can see the distances between notes so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.220 
can see the distances between notes so
easy<00:03:55.549> on<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.879> keyboard<00:03:56.299> that<00:03:56.719> you<00:03:56.750> can<00:03:56.870> if

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
easy on the keyboard that you can if

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.690 
easy on the keyboard that you can if
you're<00:03:57.319> playing<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.650> trombone<00:03:57.859> or<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.489> clarinet

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
you're playing a trombone or a clarinet

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.940 
you're playing a trombone or a clarinet
or<00:03:58.939> something<00:03:59.359> but<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.049> see<00:04:00.230> e<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.530> F<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:00.919> a

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
or something but you can see e to F is a

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.550 
or something but you can see e to F is a
natural<00:04:01.519> half<00:04:01.790> step<00:04:02.169> because<00:04:03.169> there's<00:04:03.379> no

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
natural half step because there's no

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.559 
natural half step because there's no
note<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:04.010> between<00:04:04.209> all<00:04:05.209> right<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.479> that's

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
note in between all right so that's

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.409 
note in between all right so that's
called<00:04:05.780> a<00:04:05.900> half<00:04:06.079> step<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.819> then<00:04:07.819> we're<00:04:08.299> going

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
called a half step and then we're going

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.539 
called a half step and then we're going
to<00:04:08.449> go<00:04:08.659> a<00:04:08.989> whole<00:04:09.349> step<00:04:09.739> from<00:04:09.769> our<00:04:10.159> fourth<00:04:10.430> scale

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
to go a whole step from our fourth scale

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.869 
to go a whole step from our fourth scale
degree<00:04:10.729> to<00:04:11.030> our<00:04:11.150> fifth<00:04:11.419> one<00:04:11.590> all<00:04:12.590> right<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.220> so

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
degree to our fifth one all right so so

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.170 
degree to our fifth one all right so so
f<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.510> G<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:15.109> a<00:04:15.500> whole<00:04:15.769> step<00:04:16.039> Cheeta<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.729> is<00:04:17.000> also

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
f to G is a whole step Cheeta a is also

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.529 
f to G is a whole step Cheeta a is also
a<00:04:17.389> whole<00:04:17.659> step<00:04:17.930> five<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.010> six<00:04:19.280> now<00:04:20.120> six<00:04:20.419> to

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
a whole step five to six now six to

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.839 
a whole step five to six now six to
seven<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:20.989> also<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.409> whole<00:04:21.680> step<00:04:22.039> now<00:04:22.460> watch<00:04:22.669> the

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
seven is also a whole step now watch the

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.339 
seven is also a whole step now watch the
last<00:04:23.000> one<00:04:23.180> though<00:04:23.270> when<00:04:23.389> we<00:04:23.419> go<00:04:23.599> from<00:04:23.780> seven<00:04:24.199> to

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
last one though when we go from seven to

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.080 
last one though when we go from seven to
one<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.830> not<00:04:24.949> seven<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.340> eight<00:04:25.490> now<00:04:25.729> because

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
one it's not seven to eight now because

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.089 
one it's not seven to eight now because
C<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.539> number<00:04:27.440> one<00:04:27.590> we're<00:04:27.830> not<00:04:27.860> going<00:04:28.039> to

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
C is number one we're not going to

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.860 
C is number one we're not going to
rename<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.430> it's<00:04:28.669> still<00:04:28.849> one<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> key<00:04:29.509> of<00:04:29.539> C

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
rename it it's still one in the key of C

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.690 
rename it it's still one in the key of C
we<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.710> half<00:04:31.009> step

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
we have a half step

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.550 
we have a half step
okay<00:04:33.650> b2<00:04:34.650> sees<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.890> half<00:04:35.190> step<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:36.470> here's<00:04:37.470> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
okay b2 sees a half step so here's the

notes and then a half step alright so to

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.530 
notes and then a half step alright so to
tetra<00:04:57.060> chords<00:04:57.330> make<00:04:57.480> up<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.900> major<00:04:58.770> scale

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
tetra chords make up that major scale

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.140 
tetra chords make up that major scale
Ionian<00:05:00.540> scale<00:05:01.430> so<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.640> you<00:05:02.760> want<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:02.970> play
