00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
about the reasons behind blade and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.160 
about the reasons behind blade and

wanted to take a quantum leap in the the

wanted to take a quantum leap in the the
capability<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.260> our<00:00:50.190> drivers<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:52.020> ways

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
capability of our drivers in two ways

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.900 
capability of our drivers in two ways
one<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.219> give<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.030> vastly<00:00:54.899> higher<00:00:55.020> dynamic

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
one to give them vastly higher dynamic

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
one to give them vastly higher dynamic
capability<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.149> two<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.770> really<00:00:59.399> lower

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
capability and two to really lower

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.819 
capability and two to really lower
distortion<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.899> had<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> clean<00:01:01.530> sheet<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
distortion so they had a clean sheet of
