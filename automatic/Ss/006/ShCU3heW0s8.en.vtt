and this one hasn't this is the same
still<00:00:48.120> handle<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> new<00:00:49.469> feature

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
still handle but this is a new feature

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
still handle but this is a new feature
is<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> only<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.880> install<00:00:51.270> that's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
is actually the only can install that's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
is actually the only can install that's
silicone<00:00:52.290> on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> base<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.489> underneath

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
silicone on the base which is underneath

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
silicone on the base which is underneath
and<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:55.350> heat<00:00:55.649> resistant<00:00:56.070> up

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
and this is actually heat resistant up

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.180 
and this is actually heat resistant up
to<00:00:56.190> 260<00:00:57.030> degrees<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> be

running<00:01:33.509> rush<00:01:34.020> ok<00:01:34.560> ok<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.520> pan<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
running rush ok ok so this pan this is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.940 
running rush ok ok so this pan this is
by<00:01:36.270> circulon<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:37.470> talk<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> hammer

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
by circulon will talk about the hammer

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
by circulon will talk about the hammer
for<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> second<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.850> has<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.330> silicone

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
for a second because it has got silicone

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
for a second because it has got silicone
but<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.290> only<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> 200<00:01:41.280> degrees<00:01:41.400> in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
but this is only up to 200 degrees in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.370 
but this is only up to 200 degrees in
the<00:01:41.729> oven<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.810> only<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.229> in

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the oven so it can it can only go in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.749 
the oven so it can it can only go in
every<00:01:43.650> piece<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> cookware<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.460> go<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
every piece of cookware can go in the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.219 
every piece of cookware can go in the
oven<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.479> different<00:01:45.689> levels<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
oven it's just different levels of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.590 
oven it's just different levels of
temperature<00:01:46.650> ok<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.520> we've<00:01:48.119> cyclones

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
temperature ok so we've cyclones

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.760 
temperature ok so we've cyclones
technology<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> thing

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
technology they actually have a thing

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
technology they actually have a thing
called<00:01:49.799> high-low<00:01:50.520> technology<00:01:51.150> these<00:01:51.299> are

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
called high-low technology these are

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.539 
called high-low technology these are
these<00:01:51.570> small<00:01:51.900> lines<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.250> helps

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
these small lines pretty much it helps

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.679 
these small lines pretty much it helps
when<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> apply<00:01:53.970> heat<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.450> base

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
when you apply heat of the base

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.050 
when you apply heat of the base
distribute<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.740> heat<00:01:55.890> evenly<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
distribute the heat evenly so it's a and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.910 
distribute the heat evenly so it's a and
even<00:01:57.630> heat<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.350> throughout<00:01:58.590> there's<00:01:58.799> no

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
even heat going throughout there's no

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
even heat going throughout there's no
hot<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.340> cold<00:01:59.490> spots<00:01:59.850> ok<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.450> can't<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.049> with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
hot or cold spots ok I can't know with

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.260 
hot or cold spots ok I can't know with
these<00:02:01.350> sauce<00:02:01.590> pans

when use a nonstick technology exactly
and<00:02:45.860> how<00:02:46.130> about<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.400> one<00:02:46.610> why<00:02:46.760> glass<00:02:47.030> lead

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
and how about this one why glass lead

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.030 
and how about this one why glass lead
glass<00:02:47.780> lids<00:02:48.049> glasses<00:02:48.560> are<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:48.829> for

furret where stainless steel leads is a

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.520 
furret where stainless steel leads is a
bit<00:02:52.489> more<00:02:52.610> professional<00:02:52.970> look<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.540> as<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.410> said

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
bit more professional look and as I said

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.960 
bit more professional look and as I said
yeah<00:02:54.680> mainly<00:02:54.920> from<00:02:55.099> monitoring<00:02:55.519> they<00:02:55.849> are

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
yeah mainly from monitoring they are

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.550 
yeah mainly from monitoring they are
tempered<00:02:56.390> glass<00:02:56.420> lids<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.380> go<00:02:57.470> in

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
tempered glass lids so they can go in

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.350 
tempered glass lids so they can go in
the<00:02:57.620> oven<00:02:57.709> at<00:02:57.860> 200<00:02:58.310> degrees<00:02:58.340> quite<00:02:58.970> happen<00:02:59.269> it
