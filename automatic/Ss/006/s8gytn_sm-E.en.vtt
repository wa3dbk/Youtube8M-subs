the<00:05:18.410> next<00:05:18.620> season<00:05:18.710> it's<00:05:19.220> not<00:05:19.370> gonna<00:05:19.520> actually

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
the next season it's not gonna actually

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.890 
the next season it's not gonna actually
be<00:05:19.880> a<00:05:19.940> subscriber<00:05:20.360> for<00:05:20.510> next<00:05:20.690> season's

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
be a subscriber for next season's

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.420 
be a subscriber for next season's
because<00:05:21.050> you<00:05:21.230> know<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.830> would<00:05:21.950> just<00:05:22.010> be<00:05:22.190> hard

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
because you know it would just be hard

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.830

to<00:05:22.580> orientate<00:05:22.970> subscribers<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.600> think<00:05:23.780> would

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
to orientate subscribers I think would

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.200 
to orientate subscribers I think would
be<00:05:23.960> better<00:05:24.080> if<00:05:24.170> we<00:05:24.260> got<00:05:24.440> directors<00:05:24.890> or<00:05:25.210> YouTube

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
be better if we got directors or YouTube

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.060 
be better if we got directors or YouTube
