00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
really difficult to convey this over a
camera<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> feel

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200

this rich type of reflectivity you look

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
this rich type of reflectivity you look
here<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.450> tell<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.900> tell<00:01:10.369> easily

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
right away that this is real gold by the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
right away that this is real gold by the
way<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> edges<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.549> they're<00:01:14.670> shaved

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
way that the edges when they're shaved

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
way that the edges when they're shaved
down<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> jeweler<00:01:16.740> made

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
down you can see where the jeweler made

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.700 
down you can see where the jeweler made
these<00:01:17.340> cuts<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> very<00:01:18.390> edges<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.350> see

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
these cuts on the very edges you can see

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
these cuts on the very edges you can see
the<00:01:19.830> reflectivity<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> real

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the reflectivity that's that is the real

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
the reflectivity that's that is the real
gold<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.380> scratch<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> has<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> K

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gold the scratch is that it has on the K

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.480 
gold the scratch is that it has on the K
and<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> flat<00:01:24.960> pieces<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.070> grooves

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and the I on the flat pieces the grooves

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.480 
and the I on the flat pieces the grooves
in<00:01:26.790> between<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> machined<00:01:27.780> parts<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
in between the machined parts on the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
in between the machined parts on the
surrounding<00:01:30.450> edges<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:31.710> things

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
surrounding edges these are all things

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.910 
surrounding edges these are all things
that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.030> used<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:34.140> looking

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that you have to get used to by looking

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
that you have to get used to by looking
at<00:01:35.009> real<00:01:35.189> gold<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> real

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
at real gold so when you get a real

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300 
at real gold so when you get a real
piece<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> gold<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> determine<00:01:37.950> from

think gold look here this does not look
like<00:03:02.760> gold<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.180> fact<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:03.780> looks<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.109> cheap

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
like gold in fact it looks like a cheap

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.330

piece of of silver-plated garbage

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.059 
piece of of silver-plated garbage
however<00:03:09.329> notice<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.470> same<00:03:10.739> clasps<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:13.069> didn't

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
however notice the same clasps I didn't

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.740 
however notice the same clasps I didn't
see<00:03:14.250> these<00:03:14.430> together<00:03:14.609> but<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.000> recognize<00:03:15.510> this

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
see these together but I recognize this

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.280 
see these together but I recognize this
clasp<00:03:16.079> as<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:17.010> gold<00:03:17.730> antique<00:03:18.060> clasp<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.230> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
clasp as a gold antique clasp so I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.629 
clasp as a gold antique clasp so I
thought<00:03:19.470> hey<00:03:19.620> maybe<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.250> came<00:03:20.370> from<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
thought hey maybe it just came from the

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.909 
thought hey maybe it just came from the
chain<00:03:20.910> maybe<00:03:21.569> it's<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.230> gold<00:03:22.620> but

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
chain maybe it's not really gold but

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.610 
chain maybe it's not really gold but
it's<00:03:23.040> worth<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.579> chance<00:03:24.349> same<00:03:25.349> thing<00:03:25.500> with

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
it's worth the chance same thing with

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.039 
it's worth the chance same thing with
the<00:03:25.739> star<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:27.329> really<00:03:27.510> tough<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.810> pick

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
the star here it's really tough to pick

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.259 
the star here it's really tough to pick
up<00:03:28.169> on<00:03:28.290> camera<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.220> star<00:03:29.549> absolutely
