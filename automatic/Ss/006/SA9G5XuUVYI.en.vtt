yesterday I was so excited for this
ultrasound<00:03:47.470> appointment<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> got<00:03:48.519> up

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
ultrasound appointment then I got up

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.300 
ultrasound appointment then I got up
early<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.540> blow<00:03:49.810> dried<00:03:50.079> my<00:03:50.109> hair<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.859> it

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.490 
early and I blow dried my hair and it
dawned<00:03:51.549> on<00:03:51.730> me<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.449> lot<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.780> hair<00:03:53.199> and<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
dawned on me I have a lot of hair and I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.050 
dawned on me I have a lot of hair and I
have<00:03:53.590> no<00:03:53.769> intention<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.400> doing<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.730> ever

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
have no intention of doing that ever

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.470 
have no intention of doing that ever
again<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.980> might<00:03:57.190> be<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.299> very

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
again so this might be one of the very

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.319 
again so this might be one of the very
few<00:03:58.659> times<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.139> see<00:03:59.349> my<00:03:59.500> hair<00:03:59.709> straight<00:04:00.069> ish

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
few times you see my hair straight ish

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.059 
few times you see my hair straight ish
because<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.599> my<00:04:01.720> own<00:04:01.870> doing<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.440> me<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> slight

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
because of my own doing so me a slight

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.920

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.460 
to start some pregnancy vlogs I'm trying
to<00:04:07.030> think<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.269> a<00:04:07.359> way<00:04:07.479> to<00:04:07.510> keep<00:04:07.900> those<00:04:08.139> vlogs

exciting<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.639> not<00:04:09.849> terribly<00:04:10.180> boring<00:04:10.569> because

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
exciting and not terribly boring because

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.180 
exciting and not terribly boring because
sometimes<00:04:11.319> they<00:04:11.440> can<00:04:11.470> be<00:04:11.680> rather<00:04:11.799> repetitive
