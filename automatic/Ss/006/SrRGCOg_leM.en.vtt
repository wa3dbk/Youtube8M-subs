00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.189 
like that this way they will resonant a
lot<00:04:54.310> nicely<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.120> works<00:04:55.360> pretty<00:04:55.539> good<00:04:55.690> as<00:04:55.990> well

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
lot nicely and works pretty good as well

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.439 
lot nicely and works pretty good as well
other<00:04:56.919> idea<00:04:57.310> could<00:04:57.490> be<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.820> know<00:04:57.850> put<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.210> down

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
other idea could be you know put it down

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.469 
other idea could be you know put it down
here<00:04:58.720> divide<00:04:59.620> this<00:04:59.860> just<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.610> passive<00:05:01.150> filter

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
here divide this just a passive filter

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.180 
here divide this just a passive filter
into<00:05:01.660> two<00:05:01.930> pieces<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.410> put<00:05:02.800> them<00:05:02.830> on<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
into two pieces and put them on the

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.640 
into two pieces and put them on the
sides<00:05:03.490> rather<00:05:03.850> than<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.449> bottom<00:05:04.810> bottom

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
sides rather than in the bottom bottom

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.400 
sides rather than in the bottom bottom
makes<00:05:05.919> because<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:07.300> they're<00:05:07.630> not<00:05:07.810> very<00:05:08.020> heavy

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
makes because is they're not very heavy

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.790 
makes because is they're not very heavy
so<00:05:08.889> bottom<00:05:09.370> make<00:05:09.550> them<00:05:09.820> bit<00:05:10.150> bit<00:05:10.960> dodgy<00:05:11.139> so

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
so bottom make them bit bit dodgy so

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.480 
so bottom make them bit bit dodgy so
that<00:05:12.699> is<00:05:12.820> my<00:05:13.000> opinion<00:05:13.300> technically<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.650> as

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
that is my opinion technically and as

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.700 
that is my opinion technically and as
you<00:05:15.760> see<00:05:15.940> in<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.150> both<00:05:16.330> comparison<00:05:16.960> please

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
you see in the both comparison please

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.680 
you see in the both comparison please
