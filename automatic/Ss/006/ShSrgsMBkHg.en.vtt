00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.400
 My name is Manuela, I'm 29 years old. 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.460
 degree in psychology is work in the area 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.800
 of human resources I met some 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.070
 ipad travels through a friend 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.499
 I was prejudiced with the courses 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.259
 online that I was talking about if it does not work for us 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:32.390
 impression that you will learn from 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.160
 It's true that you're going to absorb me. 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.290
 I said but I'll try. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.910
 I tried to like the ipad and loved it because it is 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.970
 dynamic is creative is the content is 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.610
 very good begins with the history of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.070
 collective behavior then I think 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.820
 interesting that they do not 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.170
 close in ones in one world only they 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.549
 they open at night, they ask for a very large fan 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.430
 how to serve and how to do 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.869
 seek source of this knowledge I felt 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.759
 that he was complete right then it is both 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.090
 in relation to new things that I 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:20.390
 I learned there are things I saw in college 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.920
 from the moment I made the course is 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.619
 I had a drive so I knew 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.350
 that I wanted to specialize in 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.140
 area of ​​the behavioral entourage is 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.590
 especially for all the content that 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.439
 I identified myself and because I see that 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 from there I have a focus for the 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.380
 future there are other ipad courses 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.759
 also in the area of ​​education related to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.920
 psychology I'm going to do because I saw 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.439
 that has a vast content is not maybe 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.009
 I also do master or whatever iped 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.209
 gave me a focus on the area of ​​study and 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.380
 workspace 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.400
 one thing I found very 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.330
 interesting in 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.650
 in ipad courses is that there are 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.680
 forums and often the doubts that I 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.370
 I had already had my question 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.710
 question and also the answer that was 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.050
 My prejudice is the kind I'm going to 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.060
 take a question and there if I could not 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.030
 take out normally I like to do the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.120
 Morning things I had breakfast understood 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.840
 it was already going directly to the computer or 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.190
 weekend when it's me too 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.709
 free time 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.190
 when I was general my certificate that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.970
 This is something I consider quite 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.030
 important I did not have the option to do 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.490
 to print at home or 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.160
 diploma in my house I would prefer 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.230
 diploma in my house and I 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.320
 I was also surprised by material that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.260
 there is no sulphite sheet material and I 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.490
 I remembered my college diploma 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:13.100
 it's very immediate it's very easy understood 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.100
 so I like it
