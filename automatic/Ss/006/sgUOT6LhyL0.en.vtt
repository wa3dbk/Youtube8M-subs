00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
make a clay pot called clay pot so we're

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.980 
make a clay pot called clay pot so we're
going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> start<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.730> bowl<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.359> clay<00:00:06.810> like

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
going to start with a bowl of clay like

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.660 
going to start with a bowl of clay like
this<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> do<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.490> make

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
this and we're going to do is make

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.490 
this and we're going to do is make
basically<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.179> long<00:00:09.450> string<00:00:10.110> out<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> kind

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
basically a long string out of it kind

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.190 
basically a long string out of it kind
of<00:00:10.590> like<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.769> snake<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.049> by

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
of like a snake so you just start by

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.379 
of like a snake so you just start by
rolling<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.099> clay<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
rolling the clay out and it's going to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.240 
rolling the clay out and it's going to
take<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> lot<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.049> while<00:00:16.440> you've<00:00:16.680> got<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> lot<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
take a lot a while you've got a lot of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.470 
take a lot a while you've got a lot of
clay<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> start<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.150> that'll<00:00:18.359> make<00:00:18.449> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
clay to start with but that'll make a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.310 
clay to start with but that'll make a
bigger<00:00:18.750> pot<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.140> that's<00:00:19.320> cool<00:00:19.439> too<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:21.320> just

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
bigger pot so that's cool too so just

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240 
bigger pot so that's cool too so just
kneading<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:22.980> using<00:00:23.369> hands<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.800> need<00:00:25.980> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
kneading it out using hands you need to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:36.650 
kneading it out using hands you need to
a<00:00:26.279> big<00:00:27.859> snake<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> works<00:00:35.969> best<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> get

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a big snake and it works best if you get

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
a big snake and it works best if you get
it<00:00:36.750> pretty<00:00:36.960> thin<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> make

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it pretty thin you kind of want to make

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.900 
it pretty thin you kind of want to make
it<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.480> thickness<00:00:42.840> across<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.739> way

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
it all the same thickness across the way

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.090 
it all the same thickness across the way
so<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.870> move<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.680> parts<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
so you have to move to the parts that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
so you have to move to the parts that
are<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.840> bigger<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> rest<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
are still bigger than the rest that the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.400 
are still bigger than the rest that the
whole<00:00:50.100> snake<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:50.940> same<00:00:51.390> thickness<00:00:51.960> all

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
whole snake is the same thickness all

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.310 
whole snake is the same thickness all
the<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.590> through

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
the way through

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.450 
the way through
you<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> pretty<00:00:55.800> big<00:00:55.949> surface<00:00:56.160> you've

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you need to pretty big surface you've

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
you need to pretty big surface you've
got<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> clay<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> working<00:01:01.020> each<00:01:01.379> part

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
got a lot of clay so working each part

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.200 
got a lot of clay so working each part
of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> dough<00:01:02.129> until<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.449> nice<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:05.210> uniform

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of the dough until it's nice and uniform

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.600 
of the dough until it's nice and uniform
always

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.850 

once<00:01:16.180> you've<00:01:16.330> got<00:01:16.540> a<00:01:16.570> snake<00:01:17.760> we're<00:01:18.760> pretty

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
once you've got a snake we're pretty

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.080 
once you've got a snake we're pretty
much<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.100> same<00:01:21.280> thickness<00:01:21.580> all<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:21.940> way

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
much the same thickness all the way

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.410 
much the same thickness all the way
through<00:01:22.860> we're<00:01:23.860> just<00:01:24.010> out<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.370> taking<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.880> and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
through we're just out of taking it and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.850 
through we're just out of taking it and
then<00:01:25.660> deciding<00:01:26.050> how<00:01:26.140> big<00:01:26.350> your<00:01:26.440> pot<00:01:26.620> is<00:01:26.770> going

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
then deciding how big your pot is going

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.700 
then deciding how big your pot is going
to<00:01:26.980> be<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:28.990> bit<00:01:29.200> thinner<00:01:29.470> yet

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
to be give it a little bit thinner yet

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.120 
to be give it a little bit thinner yet
here<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:32.830> go

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
here there we go

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.040 
here there we go
so<00:01:33.610> then<00:01:33.850> shaping<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.450> bottom<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.840> pot

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
so then shaping the bottom of a pot

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.110 
so then shaping the bottom of a pot
you're<00:01:35.530> going<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.770> take<00:01:36.070> fit<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.820> end<00:01:36.940> of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
you're going to take fit and one end of

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.000 
you're going to take fit and one end of
the<00:01:37.270> same<00:01:38.020> fish<00:01:38.230> you've<00:01:38.350> got<00:01:38.530> one<00:01:38.710> straw<00:01:38.890> it's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
the same fish you've got one straw it's

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.510 
the same fish you've got one straw it's
spiraling<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.310> want<00:01:42.460> to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
spiraling it in and then you want to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.700 
spiraling it in and then you want to
keep<00:01:42.730> doing<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.150> all<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.420> way<00:01:43.570> through

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
keep doing that all the way through

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.620 
keep doing that all the way through
until<00:01:44.710> you<00:01:44.740> have<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.820> size<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.420> want

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
until you have the size that you want

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.970 
until you have the size that you want
the<00:01:46.810> pot<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.230> be<00:01:47.350> because<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.650> will<00:01:47.830> be<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
the pot to be because this will be the

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.740 
the pot to be because this will be the
bottom<00:01:48.370> just<00:01:49.120> make<00:01:49.330> sure<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.480> you<00:01:49.630> leave

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
bottom just make sure that you leave

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.180 
bottom just make sure that you leave
enough<00:01:49.900> clay<00:01:50.050> that<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.590> can<00:01:50.740> actually<00:01:50.890> go<00:01:51.160> up

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
enough clay that you can actually go up

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.630 
enough clay that you can actually go up
around<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.970> edges<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.450> make<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.750> sides<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
around the edges to make the sides so

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.380 
around the edges to make the sides so
keep<00:01:55.270> spiraling<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:56.050> in<00:01:57.090> until<00:01:58.090> we've<00:01:58.210> got

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
keep spiraling that in until we've got

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.780 
keep spiraling that in until we've got
nice<00:01:58.980> shape<00:01:59.980> for<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.280> bottom<00:02:01.230> then<00:02:02.790> you'll

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
nice shape for the bottom then you'll

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.580 
nice shape for the bottom then you'll
want<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.090> just<00:02:04.150> continue<00:02:04.510> doing<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.080> spiral

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
want to just continue doing a spiral

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.140 
want to just continue doing a spiral
shape<00:02:05.620> but<00:02:06.070> now<00:02:06.130> we're<00:02:06.310> going<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.490> start<00:02:06.760> going

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
shape but now we're going to start going

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.950 
shape but now we're going to start going
up<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.320> pot<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.940> instead<00:02:10.480> of<00:02:10.540> just<00:02:10.780> going

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
up the pot so instead of just going

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.800 
up the pot so instead of just going
along<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.560> edges<00:02:12.010> along<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.090> table<00:02:13.480> you're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
along the edges along the table you're

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.690 
along the edges along the table you're
going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.990> take<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.440> next<00:02:14.590> layer<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:14.920> go<00:02:15.310> over

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
going to take the next layer and go over

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
going to take the next layer and go over
the<00:02:15.820> language<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.330> dishes<00:02:16.660> if<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.530> rips<00:02:17.710> like<00:02:17.920> I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the language of dishes if it rips like I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.680 
the language of dishes if it rips like I
just<00:02:18.100> did<00:02:18.370> that's<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.730> problem<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.330> put<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
just did that's a problem just put it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.870 
just did that's a problem just put it
back<00:02:19.780> together<00:02:20.020> as<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.470> spiral<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.730> we'll

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
back together as you spiral so we'll

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.190 
back together as you spiral so we'll
take<00:02:25.030> those<00:02:25.209> ends<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.810> piece<00:02:26.050> them<00:02:26.140> back

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
take those ends and piece them back

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.180 
take those ends and piece them back
together<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:28.230> continue<00:02:29.230> adding<00:02:29.530> one<00:02:29.890> layer

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
together and continue adding one layer

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.760 
together and continue adding one layer
over<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.489> top<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:31.060> same<00:02:31.239> spiral<00:02:31.570> shape<00:02:31.959> but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
over the top the same spiral shape but

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.550 
over the top the same spiral shape but
just<00:02:32.950> going<00:02:33.100> up<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.320> way<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
just going up like so all the way and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.140 
just going up like so all the way and
making<00:02:38.800> sure<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.190> nicely<00:02:39.430> stacked<00:02:39.850> so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
making sure that it's nicely stacked so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.199 
making sure that it's nicely stacked so
it<00:02:40.239> doesn't<00:02:40.510> fall<00:02:40.840> down<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.060> I'm

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
it doesn't fall down on you and I'm

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.810 
it doesn't fall down on you and I'm
taking<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> way<00:02:44.020> up<00:02:44.140> then<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.640> can

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
taking that all the way up then you can

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.210 
taking that all the way up then you can
shape<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> edges<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.260> make<00:02:47.320> sure<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.709> look

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
shape the edges and make sure that look

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.880 
shape the edges and make sure that look
like<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.610> all<00:02:48.760> packed<00:02:49.120> together<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.739> it

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
like it's all packed together so that it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.140 
like it's all packed together so that it
doesn't<00:02:51.130> fall<00:02:51.220> back<00:02:51.280> apart<00:02:51.760> as<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.330> dries

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
doesn't fall back apart as it dries

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.960 
doesn't fall back apart as it dries
shaping<00:02:55.150> out<00:02:55.270> all<00:02:55.450> real<00:02:55.690> nicely<00:02:56.700> making<00:02:57.700> sure

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
shaping out all real nicely making sure

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.120 
shaping out all real nicely making sure
that<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.239> bottom<00:02:58.390> layer<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:59.320> stuffed<00:02:59.709> nicely

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that the bottom layer is stuffed nicely

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.680 
that the bottom layer is stuffed nicely
into<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> part<00:03:00.820> that's<00:03:01.030> staying<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.600> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
into the part that's staying on the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.440 
into the part that's staying on the
table<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.230> made<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> original<00:03:03.010> part

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
table that you made in the original part

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.280 
table that you made in the original part
and<00:03:05.580> there<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.480> coil<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.080> play<00:03:08.230> pop

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and there you go one coil to play pop

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.620 
and there you go one coil to play pop
all<00:03:11.290> right<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:11.950> for<00:03:12.190> finishing<00:03:12.550> a<00:03:12.730> pot<00:03:12.940> you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
all right so so for finishing a pot you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.960 
all right so so for finishing a pot you
can<00:03:13.930> either<00:03:14.080> let<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> dry<00:03:14.860> as<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.610> is<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.880> then

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
can either let it dry as it is and then

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.090 
can either let it dry as it is and then
paint<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.360> or<00:03:16.810> you<00:03:17.019> could<00:03:17.170> also<00:03:17.440> add<00:03:17.800> designs

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
paint it or you could also add designs

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.910 
paint it or you could also add designs
to<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.850> edges<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.420> sides<00:03:19.630> before<00:03:19.920> finishes

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
to the edges and sides before finishes

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.780 
to the edges and sides before finishes
so<00:03:22.650> let's<00:03:23.650> do<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> maybe<00:03:24.400> we<00:03:24.520> can

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
so let's do a maybe we can

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910 
so let's do a maybe we can
like<00:03:24.879> a<00:03:24.909> basket<00:03:25.540> sort<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.989> design<00:03:26.290> on<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.680> one

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
like a basket sort of design on this one

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.729 
like a basket sort of design on this one
I'm<00:03:27.849> just<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.180> cut<00:03:28.390> some<00:03:28.659> lines<00:03:29.019> that<00:03:29.349> go

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I'm just going to cut some lines that go

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.860 
I'm just going to cut some lines that go
across<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> at<00:03:32.769> an<00:03:32.890> angle<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:34.659> I<00:03:34.719> would

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
across kind of at an angle and I would

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.899 
across kind of at an angle and I would
do<00:03:34.959> that<00:03:34.989> all<00:03:35.230> around<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.459> makes<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.760> kind

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
do that all around and it makes it kind

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.750 
do that all around and it makes it kind
of<00:03:36.969> look<00:03:37.090> like<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:37.989> woven<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:39.489> kind<00:03:39.700> of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
of look like it's woven like kind of

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.089 
of look like it's woven like kind of
like<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:39.909> basket<00:03:40.359> shape<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:41.739> give<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.069> some

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
like a basket shape just give it some

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.330 
like a basket shape just give it some
texture<00:03:43.739> but<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.829> could<00:03:44.920> do<00:03:44.980> anything<00:03:45.189> you

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
texture but you could do anything you

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.509 
texture but you could do anything you
want<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.730> can<00:03:45.939> use<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.720> knife<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.930> draw

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
want you can use the knife to draw

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.059 
want you can use the knife to draw
circles<00:03:48.519> or<00:03:48.849> stars<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.659> can<00:03:49.780> do<00:03:49.870> whole<00:03:50.260> parts

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
circles or stars you can do whole parts

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.959 
circles or stars you can do whole parts
you<00:03:51.400> can<00:03:51.519> do<00:03:51.609> a<00:03:51.639> whole<00:03:51.849> bunch<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.150> different

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:53.969 
you can do a whole bunch of different

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.780 
you can do a whole bunch of different
designs<00:03:54.969> whatever<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.629> like<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:57.549> clay

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
designs whatever you like to the clay

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.289 
designs whatever you like to the clay
before<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.750> let<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.019> dry<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.000> then<00:04:01.000> when

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
before you let it dry and then when

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.470 
before you let it dry and then when
you're<00:04:01.450> ready<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.790> like<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.180> designs

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
you're ready and you like the designs

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.780 
you're ready and you like the designs
you've<00:04:04.750> got<00:04:05.129> just<00:04:06.129> like<00:04:06.220> that

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
you've got just like that

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.909 
you've got just like that
and<00:04:06.879> then<00:04:07.030> once<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.019> does<00:04:08.169> dry<00:04:08.409> you<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.650> paint

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
and then once it does dry you can paint

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.349 
and then once it does dry you can paint
it<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:09.340> one<00:04:09.819> thing<00:04:09.909> you<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.209> make<00:04:10.329> sure

of is that you can put whatever you want
in<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.220> pot<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.939> want<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.180> make<00:04:13.329> sure
