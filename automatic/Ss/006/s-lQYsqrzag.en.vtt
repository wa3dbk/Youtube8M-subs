point<00:01:29.009> he's<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.400> good<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.549> controlling

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
point he's very good at controlling

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.319

event with Luke Rockhold and Lyoto
Machida<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:53.270> think<00:04:53.659> this<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:53.960> going<00:04:54.229> the

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
Machida I think this one is going the

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.320 
Machida I think this one is going the
full<00:04:54.560> 25<00:04:55.039> minutes<00:04:55.460> do<00:04:55.580> you<00:04:55.639> feel<00:04:55.849> that<00:04:56.060> if

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
full 25 minutes do you feel that if

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.839 
full 25 minutes do you feel that if
there<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> finish<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.680> this<00:04:57.919> luke<00:04:58.550> rockhold

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
there is a finish is this luke rockhold

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.600 
there is a finish is this luke rockhold
fight<00:04:59.330> to<00:04:59.449> finish<00:04:59.719> I<00:05:00.009> think<00:05:01.009> so<00:05:01.190> but<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.430> could

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
fight to finish I think so but I could

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.309 
fight to finish I think so but I could
be<00:05:01.639> wrong<00:05:01.729> because<00:05:02.060> lyoto<00:05:02.569> machida<00:05:02.629> is<00:05:03.020> one<00:05:03.199> of

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
be wrong because lyoto machida is one of

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.499 
be wrong because lyoto machida is one of
those<00:05:03.409> guys<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:04.430> you're<00:05:04.940> sleeping<00:05:05.389> on

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
those guys that if you're sleeping on

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.540 
those guys that if you're sleeping on
him<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.169> get<00:05:06.289> too<00:05:06.560> confident<00:05:07.129> he<00:05:07.370> can

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
him and you get too confident he can

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.700 
him and you get too confident he can
catch<00:05:07.819> you<00:05:08.120> but<00:05:08.509> then<00:05:08.629> again<00:05:08.750> we<00:05:09.020> saw<00:05:09.169> he<00:05:09.349> hit

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
catch you but then again we saw he hit

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.499 
catch you but then again we saw he hit
Chris<00:05:09.979> Weidman<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.430> whole<00:05:10.610> bunch<00:05:10.849> of<00:05:10.969> times<00:05:11.240> and

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
Chris Weidman a whole bunch of times and

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.999 
Chris Weidman a whole bunch of times and
Chris<00:05:11.900> Weidman<00:05:12.289> proved<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.590> he<00:05:12.710> could<00:05:12.860> take

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
Chris Weidman proved that he could take

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.950 
Chris Weidman proved that he could take
it<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.219> think<00:05:13.340> Luke<00:05:13.639> Rockhold<00:05:14.090> should<00:05:14.719> be<00:05:14.840> able

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
it I think Luke Rockhold should be able

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.480 
it I think Luke Rockhold should be able
to<00:05:15.139> take<00:05:15.319> the<00:05:15.440> punishment<00:05:15.650> if<00:05:16.069> anybody's

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
to take the punishment if anybody's

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.100 
to take the punishment if anybody's
getting<00:05:16.639> stopped<00:05:17.029> unfortunately<00:05:17.719> I<00:05:17.750> think<00:05:17.990> it

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
getting stopped unfortunately I think it

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.320 
getting stopped unfortunately I think it
might<00:05:18.229> be<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:18.469> former<00:05:18.770> 205<00:05:19.250> yeah<00:05:19.490> this<00:05:19.939> this

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
might be the former 205 yeah this this

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.570 
might be the former 205 yeah this this
