00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.490 
it's kind of really hard to say I don't
see<00:02:41.550> any<00:02:41.790> claw<00:02:42.060> marks<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> tips<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
see any claw marks at the tips of the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.960 
see any claw marks at the tips of the
toes<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:47.069> kind<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.459> funny<00:02:47.730> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
toes so you know it's kind of funny and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
toes so you know it's kind of funny and
then<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.330> almost<00:02:48.840> appears<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.590> there's<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
then it's almost appears like there's a

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.620 
then it's almost appears like there's a
thumb<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.510> left<00:02:51.900> side<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.380> print<00:02:52.709> so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
thumb on the left side of the print so

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.780 
thumb on the left side of the print so
could<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.780> bear<00:02:55.110> could<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.190> something<00:02:56.489> else

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
could be bear could be something else

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.539 
could be bear could be something else
but<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.750> cast<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:59.329> look<00:03:00.329> around<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.840> other

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
but I cast it look around for other

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.330 
but I cast it look around for other
footprints<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.820> stuff

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
footprints and stuff

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
however it could be an overstep which

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.330 
however it could be an overstep which
you<00:04:37.690> know<00:04:37.780> if<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.290> was<00:04:38.470> a<00:04:38.500> bear<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.920> could<00:04:39.130> be<00:04:39.250> an

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
you know if it was a bear it could be an

you know if it was a bear it could be an
overstep<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:40.960> don't<00:04:41.530> think<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:41.980> but<00:04:42.930> looks<00:04:43.930> good

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
overstep I don't think so but looks good

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.810 
overstep I don't think so but looks good
to<00:04:44.320> me<00:04:45.210> after<00:04:46.210> looking<00:04:46.660> at<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.580> prints<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:48.700> the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
to me after looking at the prints in the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.040 
to me after looking at the prints in the
mud<00:04:48.850> I<00:04:49.450> did<00:04:50.080> some<00:04:50.290> hiking<00:04:50.440> down<00:04:50.920> a<00:04:50.980> trail<00:04:51.400> and

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
mud I did some hiking down a trail and

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.660 
mud I did some hiking down a trail and
then<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.170> got<00:04:53.380> off<00:04:53.530> trail<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.160> happened<00:04:54.190> to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
then I got off trail and I happened to

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.270 
then I got off trail and I happened to
actually<00:04:55.150> spot<00:04:56.140> what<00:04:56.500> appeared<00:04:56.920> to<00:04:57.010> be<00:04:57.130> a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
actually spot what appeared to be a

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.950 
actually spot what appeared to be a
lean-to<00:04:57.640> I<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:59.380> tweaked<00:04:59.740> my<00:04:59.980> interest<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.550> I

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
lean-to I it tweaked my interest so I

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.070 
lean-to I it tweaked my interest so I
decided<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.290> take<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> closer<00:05:03.370> look<00:05:03.630> this<00:05:04.630> could

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
decided to take a closer look this could

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.940 
decided to take a closer look this could
be<00:05:05.110> man-made<00:05:05.700> maybe<00:05:06.700> it's<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.770> looked<00:05:08.770> at

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
be man-made maybe it's not I looked at

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.580 
be man-made maybe it's not I looked at
the<00:05:09.100> ends<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.640> didn't<00:05:09.970> see<00:05:10.180> any<00:05:10.390> cut<00:05:10.750> ends<00:05:11.410> on

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
the ends I didn't see any cut ends on

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.090
