00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.650
 this time I come to bring you 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.999
 Another section of wise people who knew 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.320
 you who using small style 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:27.779
 and big style 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.119
 we make our hair burst 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.150
 more for the simple essentials though 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.820
 this material the more they abuse 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.400
 it becomes more sticky and the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 people of our hair to hit each 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.600
 time we use it then 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.970
 we like pulling is nice of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.129
 We are removing our hair 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.440
 the strand is stuck and leaves 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 busting sometimes we do not notice the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.519
 difference because sometimes we do it with 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
 a lot of hair and there are people who have 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.800
 hair in abundance as well as mine 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.770
 and then we did not notice it but at the end of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.440
 day or at the end of everything that has happened 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.240
 so much that we use and use this because if 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.800
 it comes we come to realize that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 Our hair is extremely 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.170
 mistreated then you direct is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.420
 What can I do? I always recommend 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.229
 simply of these solitos 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.960
 but that they are covered with a fabric and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.899
 be it as thin as that is going to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.470
 help our hair to go 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.149
 keeping let's say less busted no 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.740
 there is to say that they are never going to 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.210
 burst us to touch the backs of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.030
 our hair when we are removing 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.360
 a wave or a hook or entrepreneur but 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.600
 this facilitates more than the Monday that is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.119
 inside this fabric do not leave as 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.429
 putting as more chic he cited it or not 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.050
 go softening and that's what makes 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.090
 our hair is going like opening 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.580
 more or stick when we talk 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.289
 then you 're going to burst another 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.289
 option that we have to do with the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.920
 high or half scola is the word 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.709
 redundancy a cloth tail that you 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.869
 can buy it in the market income 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.810
 but in the dollar stores you 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.310
 can buy but fabric so 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.569
 I hope you liked my opinion 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.200
 we will be seeing in the next 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.200
 tutorial
