can be tailored to play exactly at your

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.510 
can be tailored to play exactly at your
level<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:27.500> expertise<00:01:28.500> or<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.829> guess<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
level of expertise or I guess it right

level of expertise or I guess it right
below<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:30.090> level<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.570> extreme<00:01:31.140> frustration

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
below your level of extreme frustration

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
below your level of extreme frustration

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
meaning that you're never going to feel

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
meaning that you're never going to feel
completely<00:01:35.070> overmatched<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.119> game

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
completely overmatched in this game

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
completely overmatched in this game
because<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.840> settings<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.500> tweaked<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
because the settings can be tweaked to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219 
because the settings can be tweaked to
make<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.939> feel<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.420> way<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.810> example<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
make you not feel that way for example I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
make you not feel that way for example I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.780 
is telling you may be slow down and it's
telling<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> exactly<00:01:52.799> how<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.189> approach<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
telling you exactly how to approach the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.929 
telling you exactly how to approach the
track<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.799> like<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.009> because<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> teaches<00:01:56.640> you

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
track I like that because it teaches you

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.490 
track I like that because it teaches you
how<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> drive<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.600> mean<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> teaches<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> what

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
how to drive I mean it teaches you what

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
how to drive I mean it teaches you what
to<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.579> lines<00:02:00.149> would<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.479> there<00:02:00.750> wind

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to do what lines would be there wind

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.010 
to do what lines would be there wind
power<00:02:01.350> when<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> slow<00:02:02.009> down<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.810> teaching

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
power when to slow down so it's teaching

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.510 
power when to slow down so it's teaching
you<00:02:04.259> kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.680> real<00:02:04.860> time<00:02:05.130> while<00:02:05.310> also

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you kind of in real time while also

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.500 
you kind of in real time while also
helping<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.149> out

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
helping you out

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.210 
helping you out
because<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.990> aren't<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.410> race<00:02:07.620> fan<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
because you just aren't a race fan and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.280 
because you just aren't a race fan and
maybe<00:02:08.850> you<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.150> know<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.570> lines<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.110> well

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
maybe you don't know the lines as well

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.610 
maybe you don't know the lines as well
as<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:11.100> some<00:02:11.940> super<00:02:12.300> hardcore<00:02:12.600> pores<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.380> race

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
as as some super hardcore pores of race

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.220 
as as some super hardcore pores of race
players<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.570> especially<00:02:15.570> because<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.110> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
players so especially because in this

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.960 
players so especially because in this
game<00:02:16.290> you're<00:02:16.620> playing<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.250> different<00:02:17.670> tracks

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
game you're playing all different tracks

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.170 
game you're playing all different tracks
like<00:02:18.410> by<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.470> first<00:02:19.860> I'm<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.430> expert<00:02:20.880> level

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
like by the first I'm on expert level

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.410 
like by the first I'm on expert level
already<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.930> haven't<00:02:22.230> played<00:02:23.120> every<00:02:24.120> track

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
already and I haven't played every track

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.700 
already and I haven't played every track
i'm<00:02:24.630> sure<00:02:24.780> there's<00:02:24.960> tracks<00:02:25.200> i<00:02:25.350> haven't<00:02:25.590> played

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
i'm sure there's tracks i haven't played

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.190 
i'm sure there's tracks i haven't played
and<00:02:26.010> even<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.850> ones<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.330> replay<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> play

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and even the ones you do replay you play

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.870 
and even the ones you do replay you play
them<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.410> Reverse<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.190> plan<00:02:29.550> them<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.820> a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
them in Reverse so you plan them in a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520 
them in Reverse so you plan them in a
different<00:02:30.060> segment<00:02:30.510> or<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.930> play<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> long

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
different segment or you play the long

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
different segment or you play the long
mile<00:02:31.890> instead<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> short<00:02:32.820> one<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.630> it's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
mile instead of the short one so it's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.440 
mile instead of the short one so it's
hard<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.410> memorize<00:02:34.680> every<00:02:35.430> single<00:02:35.790> track<00:02:36.210> for

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
hard to memorize every single track for

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.400 
hard to memorize every single track for
the<00:02:36.540> average<00:02:36.710> force<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.890> player<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.380> overall<00:02:40.380> I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the average force a player so overall I

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.960 
the average force a player so overall I
like<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.920> line<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.400> there<00:02:41.550> because<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> gives

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
like the line on there because it gives

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.390 
like the line on there because it gives
you<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.860> something<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> follow<00:02:44.160> in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
you kind of a something to follow in

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.340 
you kind of a something to follow in
real<00:02:44.670> time<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.450> Down<00:02:45.810> mountain

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
real time now this is a Down mountain

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.470 
real time now this is a Down mountain
traffic<00:02:46.950> situation<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.760> I'm<00:02:47.880> running<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.330> on

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
traffic situation so I'm running up on

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.220 
beat this other WRX impreza that is
following<00:02:59.550> me<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.600> really<00:03:00.690> kind<00:03:01.170> of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.690 
following me and it's really kind of
tricky<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.920> got<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> pick<00:03:02.370> window

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
tricky because you got to pick window

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.850 
tricky because you got to pick window
