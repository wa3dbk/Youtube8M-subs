00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
so what I've done is just went ahead and
applied<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.500> glue<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.040> I'm<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:12.080> waiting

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
applied the glue and I'm just waiting

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.430 
applied the glue and I'm just waiting
just<00:02:13.980> letting<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.370> glue<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.700> tacky<00:02:14.760> and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
just letting the glue to get tacky and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.080 
just letting the glue to get tacky and
the<00:02:16.440> reason<00:02:16.710> why<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.860> want<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> wait<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.430> 60

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the reason why you want to wait for 60

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.630 
the reason why you want to wait for 60
seconds<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> glue<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.490> have

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
seconds or so and so the glue can have

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.820 
seconds or so and so the glue can have
time<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.270> get<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> little<00:02:21.840> sticky<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> way

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
time to get a little sticky so that way

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.480 
time to get a little sticky so that way
it<00:02:22.980> helps<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.400> adhere<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.910> your<00:02:24.030> lash<00:02:24.660> line

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
it helps to adhere to your lash line

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.640 
it helps to adhere to your lash line
you're<00:02:26.490> not<00:02:26.640> doing<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.780> results

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
you're not doing so is going to results

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.790 
you're not doing so is going to results
in<00:02:28.890> your<00:02:29.430> eyelashes<00:02:30.150> slipping<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.990> that<00:02:31.050> is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
in your eyelashes slipping and that is

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.650 
in your eyelashes slipping and that is
where<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.220> creates<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.730> mess<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.510> why

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
where it creates a mess and that is why

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
where it creates a mess and that is why
many<00:02:34.110> people<00:02:34.170> find<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.070> very<00:02:35.130> difficult<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
many people find it very difficult to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.000 
many people find it very difficult to
apply<00:02:35.880> lashes<00:02:36.290> because<00:02:37.290> they're<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.620> taking

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
apply lashes because they're not taking

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.170 
apply lashes because they're not taking
the<00:02:38.100> time<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.610> wait<00:02:38.820> for<00:02:39.510> your<00:02:39.930> gluts<00:02:40.350> again

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
the time to wait for your gluts again

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
the time to wait for your gluts again
tacky<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.170> if<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.500> doing<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.740> clients

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
tacky so if you're doing the clients

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.760 
tacky so if you're doing the clients
lashes<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.520> do<00:02:44.580> not<00:02:44.790> recommend<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.750> blow<00:02:46.740> on

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
lashes I do not recommend you to blow on

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.490 
lashes I do not recommend you to blow on
the<00:02:47.070> lashes<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.209> germs<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.050> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the lashes because that is germs and you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.840 
the lashes because that is germs and you
are<00:02:51.050> spraying<00:02:52.050> bacteria<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.070> lashes<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
are spraying bacteria on the lashes and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.610 
are spraying bacteria on the lashes and
so<00:02:54.060> when<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> lash<00:02:54.930> glue<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.350> dry<00:02:55.560> I'm

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
so when I think the lash glue is dry I'm

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.490 
so when I think the lash glue is dry I'm
gonna<00:02:55.770> grab<00:02:56.070> my<00:02:56.100> tweezers<00:02:57.110> I'm<00:02:58.110> gonna<00:02:58.320> look

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.750 
into a mirror and now you can look
downwards<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.620> choose<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.220> look<00:03:02.459> across
