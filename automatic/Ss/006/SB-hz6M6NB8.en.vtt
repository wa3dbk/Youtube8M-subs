I tend to like to peruse price nicotine

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
for me so silly ass it tends to have a
drawing<00:02:12.840> effect

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
drawing effect

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.990 
drawing effect
I<00:02:13.590> use<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.280> past<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.610> didn't<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:14.970> it

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I use it in the past I didn't like it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
I use it in the past I didn't like it
even<00:02:15.720> though<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.140> products<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
even though I have products now that I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.490 
even though I have products now that I
do<00:02:17.280> contain<00:02:17.700> steelix<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> acid<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.020> try

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
do contain steelix the acid but I try

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000 
do contain steelix the acid but I try
not<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> use<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.670> much<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.800> was

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
not to use it that much now this was

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.680 
not to use it that much now this was
drawing<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.489> me<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.150> might<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.330> be

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
drawing for me and it might just be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.440 
drawing for me and it might just be
because<00:02:24.810> simply<00:02:25.500> it's<00:02:25.920> an<00:02:26.370> exfoliant<00:02:27.000> wash<00:02:27.270> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
because simply it's an exfoliant wash I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.150 
because simply it's an exfoliant wash I
suppose<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.900> cream<00:02:28.140> cleanser<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.830> might

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
suppose it a cream cleanser that might

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.830 
suppose it a cream cleanser that might
be<00:02:29.310> thing<00:02:29.640> because<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.269> only<00:02:30.420> has<00:02:30.599> five

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
be thing because this only has five

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
be thing because this only has five
percent<00:02:31.170> benzoyl<00:02:31.500> peroxide<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.099> like<00:02:32.190> i<00:02:32.220> said

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
percent benzoyl peroxide and like i said

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.610 
percent benzoyl peroxide and like i said
i<00:02:32.700> used<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.120> crew<00:02:33.840> funds<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.349> could<00:02:34.500> take

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
i used the crew funds that I could take

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
i used the crew funds that I could take
ten<00:02:34.800> percent<00:02:35.130> benzoyl<00:02:35.430> peroxide<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:36.090> wasn't

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
ten percent benzoyl peroxide it wasn't

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.710 
ten percent benzoyl peroxide it wasn't
really<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.140> drawing<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.620> me<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:39.650> think

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
really that drawing for me so I think

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.089 
really that drawing for me so I think
this<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.959> good<00:02:43.110> product<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.860> would<00:02:44.010> say

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
this is a good product but I would say

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.820 
this is a good product but I would say
be<00:02:44.250> careful<00:02:44.459> with<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> i<00:02:45.450> would<00:02:46.200> say<00:02:46.410> uses

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
be careful with it and i would say uses

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.550 
be careful with it and i would say uses
in<00:02:46.950> moderation<00:02:47.280> i<00:02:47.640> was<00:02:48.269> using<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.930> once<00:02:49.470> or

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
in moderation i was using like once or

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.550 
in moderation i was using like once or
twice<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.799> day<00:02:50.010> i'm<00:02:50.910> probably<00:02:51.209> cut<00:02:51.510> back<00:02:51.690> down

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
twice a day i'm probably cut back down

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080 
twice a day i'm probably cut back down
to<00:02:52.830> me<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.340> every<00:02:53.549> other<00:02:53.640> day<00:02:53.819> simply

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
to me like every other day simply

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
to me like every other day simply
because<00:02:54.360> it's<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.600> my<00:02:54.810> skin<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.049> clearing<00:02:55.319> up

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
because it's like my skin is clearing up

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.390 
because it's like my skin is clearing up
now<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:57.319> it's<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.530> breaking<00:02:58.769> out<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.190> much

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
now and it's not breaking out as much

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.830 
now and it's not breaking out as much
but<00:03:01.099> um<00:03:02.099> it's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.819> good<00:03:02.970> product<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.750> be

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
but um it's a good product but just be

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.380 
but um it's a good product but just be
careful<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.530> now<00:03:05.489> Ross<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.940> moisturizer

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.289 
moisturizing as I would like it to be

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
especially since this is very drying but

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.150 
especially since this is very drying but

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
get the vino products i will probably

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.680 
get the vino products i will probably
switch<00:04:43.500> this<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:44.100> simply<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> nighttime

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
switch this to a simply a nighttime

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.200 
switch this to a simply a nighttime
moisturizer<00:04:45.930> because<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:47.340> aveeno<00:04:47.760> contains

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
moisturizer because the aveeno contains

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.480 
moisturizer because the aveeno contains
SPF<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:49.050> i'll<00:04:49.139> see<00:04:49.350> I'm<00:04:49.440> only<00:04:49.560> SPF<00:04:50.160> at<00:04:50.310> night

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
SPF and i'll see I'm only SPF at night

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.120 
SPF and i'll see I'm only SPF at night
so<00:04:50.970> this<00:04:51.540> is<00:04:51.570> probably<00:04:51.810> good<00:04:52.169> just<00:04:52.680> simply<00:04:52.979> as

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
so this is probably good just simply as

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.250 
so this is probably good just simply as
a<00:04:53.160> nighttime<00:04:53.520> moisturizer<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.479> as<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:55.020> toner

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
a nighttime moisturizer and as a toner
