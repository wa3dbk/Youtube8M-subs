carving<00:00:02.280> means<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.790> blades<00:00:03.120> are<00:00:03.360> coming<00:00:03.690> out

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
carving means the blades are coming out

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.630 
carving means the blades are coming out
so<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.470> first<00:00:04.770> thing<00:00:05.010> we<00:00:05.130> want<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.460> talk<00:00:05.580> about

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so the first thing we want to talk about

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.530 
so the first thing we want to talk about
is<00:00:06.090> safety<00:00:06.890> you<00:00:07.890> want<00:00:08.250> sharp<00:00:08.670> blades<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.389> you

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
is safety you want sharp blades so you

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
is safety you want sharp blades so you
are<00:00:09.629> not<00:00:09.809> pushing<00:00:10.080> too<00:00:10.410> hard<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.769> cut<00:00:10.980> Plus<00:00:11.639> you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
are not pushing too hard to cut Plus you

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.299 
are not pushing too hard to cut Plus you
will<00:00:11.879> get<00:00:12.120> nice<00:00:12.480> smooth<00:00:12.900> lines<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.589> you<00:00:14.280> want

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
will get nice smooth lines and you want

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.970 
will get nice smooth lines and you want
your<00:00:14.700> block<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.209> stay<00:00:15.419> in<00:00:15.509> place<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.710> best

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.240 
your block to stay in place the best
thing<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.940> bench<00:00:18.390> hook<00:00:19.250> speedball

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
thing for that is a bench hook speedball

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.890
