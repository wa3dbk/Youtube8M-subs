00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.210
 this one invited trader unboxing for 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.490
 the month of march 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 yes it is very late that is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.380
 but unfortunately not to me but to invited 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.670
 traders themselves because they have somehow 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.020
 that does not get it that far in the row 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 to send package so that it on time 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.820
 post strike and easter and yes to everyone 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 case , then it does not matter now 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.810
 I hope that it will be from this month 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.970
 again a bit on time everything 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 does the box work normally ? 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.300
 always end the month sent so 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.219
 They actually still end of the month 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.059
 arrives that unfortunately has us at all 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 not hit the box came yesterday that 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.559
 was yesterday 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.480
 the thirteenth or so is natural 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.770
 then very late but now how 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.870
 I always show you something 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.789
 the box had this in it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 the title jump'n'run next month 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.910
 is entertainment as far as I know and 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.090
 I like the content just fine 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.039
 man too yes i found with the t shirt on 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.229
 and as already mentioned in each 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.020
 box a t shirt inside every month and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.299
 I like it quite well this time 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.630
 this one, and we have one here 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.070
 t shirt with the jump'n'run hero like 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.960
 I think Mario is very cool 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.630
 this cigar then crash bandicoot 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 earthworm jim we have donkey kong 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.200
 then of course we have sunny and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.729
 this colleague where I again the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 forgot names because I knew that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.850
 not at all funny 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.780
 yes passed me my husband can 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 I do not like him either 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 I do not remember what his name is 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.280
 have the extra googled I have none 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.900
 idea 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.460
 In any case, the t-shirt is again 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.750
 very nice because you have that too 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.369
 he has already worn extra 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.229
 undressed for the video 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think the colors are great, I think so 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.350
 printing is beautiful the quality is good 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.170
 is a nice thick fabric so you 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.759
 can not complain 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.579
 and this week is always 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.860
 this packages where it says what's inside 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.140
 and according to this free costume and t 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 In 1998 you bought it that way 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 you can still order like that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.049
 I put the whole left on you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.820
 of course, back down to the infobox 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.560
 who the video the first unboxing of me 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.030
 I did not see you there 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.649
 link normally put up here in the corner 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.870
 there can click on it because I explain 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.390
 everything to the monthly subscriptions and how 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.489
 Anyway, annual subscription blablabla then 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.580
 it goes on and although was in the box 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.260
 This totally cute little friend and that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.810
 the power up mushroom of mario and the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.310
 I think it's especially cute because it is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.379
 is just totally cool or 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 So I thought I was freaking out 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.799
 I had already saved myself 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.060
 I must confess before that was too 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.370
 stupid to wait there I have with the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.959
 others already a bit pure 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.760
 geburt what's in the box is in it and 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.650
 I said the box is actually 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.060
 for my husband who ordered 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.470
 But I think the products just as cool 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.079
 and that's why I'm happy, of course 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.340
 and yes I was glad he was 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.690
 he did not want that and I have 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 also said he should leave it because of me 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.299
 have the things as cool 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.620
 In any case, this sweet little one 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.359
 Colleague will most likely 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.340
 to find his place tinker with me 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.620
 or we will have a showcase 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.420
 Showcase showcase yes in the living room 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 because the things are really cool 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.579
 so this produces 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:13.170
 the mushroom costs 699 then we have 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:19.109
 in there this sonic the hedgehog bouncy 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.030
 ball and assign it a gum and there 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.450
 are still so small things 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.160
 at sun there since 1991 I was there 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.190
 just ten years old is already real 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.349
 violently sonic I must say was never 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 So I love jump'n'run mario 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.900
 of course everything ripped through I love 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.269
 also yes crash bandicoot was now too 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 never quite but it was alright 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.169
 so sunny was where i always thought 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.699
 hp so this hedgehog is turning and 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:48.959
 turns and rolls and rolls and the 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.699
 You always had the feeling you 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.260
 not you do not control it at all i know 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.510
 not if someone can understand that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.040
 i never liked sonic and i like it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.690
 the box also a bit front classical 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.019
 but good I think the thing anyway 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.090
 cool and yes that in any case 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.489
 rubber with extreme construction is on it 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.949
 So he supposedly jumps extremely me 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.209
 I have not yet unpacked it 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.629
 Let's see if I have to do it then 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.629
 I'll see 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.150
 so the gum costs 7 euro 90 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.970
 then it goes on and indeed found that 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.240
 I also totally cool here we have 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.680
 once a great mario candy cane look at you 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 That's not cool at times 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.320
 that's just this mario everyone would 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.389
 I hope she knows and yes that's one 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.250
 tin can and up here you can on the 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.490
 you went there so are then such 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.500
 small grapes to camorra after content 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.759
 also like the mario I have to know 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:49.320
 not at all if you can see that 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:49.320
 yes you can recognize absolutely brilliant 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.599
 I like the grape sugar 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:01.780
 tastes like nano grape sugar costs 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.419
 five euro 90 I think is very cool 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.030
 you absolutely have to find something like that 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.610
 I also do not know why 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.970
 but I think I already have great 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.500
 said what he costs 590 and then 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.470
 Let's get to the last product and that 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.440
 that was an extra surprise 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.909
 that was extra packed I think so too 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.949
 very cool that's something I like 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.330
 never buy it yourself but so in 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.010
 the package is already longer and indeed 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.000
 is it a sonic money I show 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.139
 you could be full size 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.960
 So I think I'm pretty 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:40.630
 cool I take you here from this time 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.260
 podest that's what her husband sticks 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.789
 the underlay 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.400
 I think that's really good, you guys 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.010
 Look that's just a savings sonic 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 law shock and looks at the nose 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.010
 so awesome so the part that has on 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.340
 definitely space in our youth 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.930
 showcase to find or find it because 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.750
 I do not know , it's easy 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.060
 totally cool and that's just you 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.090
 and yes I do not remember 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.250
 I think it's great here and there 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.440
 I'm not angry, but I say 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.770
 still find something totally awesome 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.080
 And this money costs 899 if you 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.580
 Of course, it also wants to buy 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.980
 not necessarily cheap because you have to 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.880
 let's say yes and everything else 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.250
 still in there then so flyers and so 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.530
 advertising 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.620
 For example, here is one 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.920
 Sticker by crash bandicoot but is 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.760
 that's a sticker then here you 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.260
 have invited you then you can on 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.430
 www.youtube.com go and do the 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.240
 reorder boxes 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.800
 but I have everything in my first 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.630
 trailer unboxing tells then was here 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.700
 such an animal part in here is pulling 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:56.110
 with donkey kong and standing here 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:00.130
 with this little friend and then 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.200
 here again invited trader.de stk yes that 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.580
 I was the loaded trader box for the march 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.410
 think she's cool so she was definitely 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.380
 better than the last fashion I found 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.700
 not so great and I am now 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.990
 very much looking forward to entertainment me 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.270
 I hope there's something of the walking dead 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.620
 is my absolute favorite series at the moment 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.220
 think the series is so great 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.169
 and yes of course I have or yes 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.669
 but that would be my favorite 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.110
 walking dead would be cool maybe 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.830
 a collectible figure or so I know too 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.990
 not worth it 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.520
 Well as I said here is again 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.100
 Overview note where then everything on it 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.840
 is synonymous so that part costs by the way 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.000
 92 Wales wants to buy this donkey 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.090
 kong door pendant so i thought that would be 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.710
 now a promotional dingsbums in there so 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:45.520
 yes as I said you trader I find one 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.930

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.140

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.880

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:00.400
 actually been there for a long time 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.540
 Well that should be for this I hope so
