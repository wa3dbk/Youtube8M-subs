00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 Hello everyone, we will continue to do our 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.240
 the game and today we will deal with what we 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.900
 learn to throw things out and wear 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.430
 inter-m 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 well then let's start first what's on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.869
 we will be made to begin with 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.179
 create a new group and name it as 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.270
 emission let's say what we do next 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.489
 next we make such an event if you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 clicked on the object that we have 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.530
 in our cells that is us before 13 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:49.079
 let's say as if we clicked on the sprite 13 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 with the right mouse button 13 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 we are going on we are going on here 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:06.890
 such an event our system will spawn us 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:08.939
 object sprite 18 checks for sprite 18 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.310
 on layer 1 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890
 why on layer 1 if we have written 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.600
 here is a layer 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.439
 4 here if you click on the ax and then we 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.000
 it says 104 here because layer 4 is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.759
 we call it number it is diy on a layer 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.650
 1 here we write our coordinates 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.380
 Main character 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:39.060
 i.e. sprite 5. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:46.020
 x sprite 5. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.480
 games so we did it I can 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.760
 pick one ax I can throw 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:56.070
 this ax but not so that we have it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:01.050
 destroyed therefore we got caught not 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.590
 it turns out so let's destroy this 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.330
 ax 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.850
 that is, if you clicked on the sprite 300 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.650
 our sprite 13 is destroyed because if 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:21.690
 now we will try to have everything 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:23.660
 work fine so here we see 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.930
 now everything works correctly with us 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.000
 but let's do a little bit differently 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.410
 so that there are no such bugs like this 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.440
 I 'll show you the number tank 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.970
 we see what we and our rockets 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.430
 spawn in one place 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.400
 if you need them now 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.850
 turned into one let's 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760
 change 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.000
 for this we go so that our ax 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:54.720
 Foldably a random we add 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.250
 here is such a code sprite 5. x + + 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:07.590
 random and in quotes we write 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 20 Well, let's say another minus class tenderness 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:20.300
 and here we write the same thing and see what 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.300
 we succeeded we can pick up 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 ax 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.140
 so by them 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.340
 if they leave axes to understand 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 will be in different places spawn well i'm all 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.239
 I can equally oblige everyone at the same time 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.760
 we will probably fix this bug 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.019
 the next lesson to trade will increase 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.060
 randomly still leave the wound house 50 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.209
 and now we can copy here 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.420
 these all events are substituting them 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.780
 be sure to group otherwise it will be then 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.540
 a lot of events on this click 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:10.340
 next to the internet we click on the sprint 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:10.340
 12 then we go spawn sprite object 17 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.040
 so our girl is also destroyed 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:24.510
 which we click 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:28.120
 so look here I throw out the cap 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:33.430
 I throw out the ax and they appear 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.250
 here so the nose is equal to such 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.110
 small bug and and tobacco later 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.110
 cope with the selection
