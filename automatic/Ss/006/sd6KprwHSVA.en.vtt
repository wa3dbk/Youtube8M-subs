form<00:03:55.139> or<00:03:55.470> fashion<00:03:55.530> was<00:03:56.010> pretty<00:03:56.220> much<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
form or fashion was pretty much a

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.020 
form or fashion was pretty much a
nightmare<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:57.180> give<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.569> up<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:59.790> is

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
nightmare so give it up on that it is

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.670 
nightmare so give it up on that it is
like<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.420> can<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.959> them<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.139> hold<00:04:01.290> up<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.650> I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
like you can get them to hold up like I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.370 
like you can get them to hold up like I
say<00:04:01.920> he's<00:04:02.010> not<00:04:02.040> very<00:04:02.549> stable<00:04:02.970> in<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:04.019> written

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
say he's not very stable in the written

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.400 
say he's not very stable in the written
instructions<00:04:05.069> they<00:04:05.250> actually<00:04:05.730> give<00:04:06.720> you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
instructions they actually give you

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.390 
instructions they actually give you
a<00:04:08.470> couple<00:04:08.950> of<00:04:09.010> pieces<00:04:09.550> here<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:12.580> basically

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
a couple of pieces here that basically

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.170 
a couple of pieces here that basically
this<00:04:15.400> goes<00:04:20.190> well<00:04:21.190> I'm<00:04:21.459> not<00:04:21.610> going<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.850> fight<00:04:22.060> it

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
this goes well I'm not going to fight it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.600 
this goes well I'm not going to fight it
right<00:04:22.390> now<00:04:22.660> but<00:04:22.990> basically<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.950> little<00:04:27.370> nub

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
right now but basically this little nub

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.000 
right now but basically this little nub
goes<00:04:27.970> under<00:04:28.330> this<00:04:28.480> little<00:04:28.810> plastic<00:04:29.080> dish<00:04:29.620> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
goes under this little plastic dish and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.980 
goes under this little plastic dish and
then<00:04:30.340> there's<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.820> third<00:04:31.270> there's<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.660> stand

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
then there's a third there's a stand

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.390 
then there's a third there's a stand
they<00:04:32.230> sell<00:04:32.500> separately<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.770> don't<00:04:36.160> have

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
they sell separately that I don't have

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.320 
they sell separately that I don't have
just<00:04:36.460> yet

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
just yet

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.250 
just yet
then<00:04:38.190> basically<00:04:39.510> normally<00:04:40.510> has<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> clip<00:04:41.110> at

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
then basically normally has a clip at

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.990 
then basically normally has a clip at
the<00:04:41.380> top<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:41.830> wraps<00:04:42.040> around<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.430> characters

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
the top that wraps around the characters

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.080 
the top that wraps around the characters
waist<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:44.350> kind<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.340> hold<00:04:45.490> them<00:04:45.640> stable

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
waist to kind of hold them stable

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.760 
waist to kind of hold them stable
apparently<00:04:46.480> you<00:04:46.600> can<00:04:46.720> take<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:46.990> clip<00:04:47.230> out<00:04:47.410> and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
apparently you can take the clip out and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.970 
apparently you can take the clip out and
put<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.600> underneath<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.900> box<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.380> prop<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:50.650> up

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
put it underneath the box to prop it up

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.100 
put it underneath the box to prop it up
so<00:04:52.410> not<00:04:53.520> too<00:04:54.520> shabby<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:55.330> they<00:04:55.540> include<00:04:55.930> the

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
so not too shabby is they include the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.830 
so not too shabby is they include the
