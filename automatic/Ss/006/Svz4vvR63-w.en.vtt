 me product but nonetheless very 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.090
 interesting probably the most interesting of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 all I would like to test 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 unusual gadgets 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.810
 This is samsung gf of course when they come out 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 Apple Watch I would like to test them too 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 no less than grs 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.670
 but this product is very difficult to get. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.279
 very expensive and not so often him 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.840
 You will meet on sale and I have appeared 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 such an opportunity and I will now unpack and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.300
 I'll show you a little and then I'll do it already. 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.559
 more comprehensive review 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 interesting machine so that here super 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 amoled appropriately curved cards 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.360
 super amoled display 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.059
 it is possible to connect 3g 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.000
 That is, the built-in 3g is by the way 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.590
 built-in gps probably as far as i know 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.109
 well or he goes via the Internet 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 tayzen wifi and bluetooth 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.400
 hell smart fitness tracker staff and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.420
 api 67 protection is resistance 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.240
 as far as i remember this is protection for well in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 shower and bathe there in the rain got but 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 no more 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.689
 Ie this not full protection so 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.189
 that swim in this watch I think that 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.640
 meaningless 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.400
 well I think yes so let me already 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 I will unpack do not pull these 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.229
 watch 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 dir with yes we will look at them a little 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.299
 further and a little more detail above all 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.649
 look at the equipment 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.270
 there is some documentation here 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.729
 turn the box over and here we are 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.240
 we can watch in kitty 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.640
 the adapter comes standard 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 samsungovsky not and change that is it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.350
 just a regular adapter with microusb and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 connector checks but it is not used 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.729
 both separately and in fact for his computer 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.079
 connect meaningless here documentation 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.569
 with more detailed product descriptions 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.940
 and its capabilities as well as in us 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.240
 Comes is such a cushion is 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.510
 connector to connect the clock to 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.510
 Charging here is such a beautiful plush 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.750
 really looks very cool but right away 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:34.380
 tell you what you can watch 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 lithium-ion 350 m hash it means that 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.660
 This one has a built-in inside. 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.300
 350 milliamp battery 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.180
 that will give the opportunity to charge your 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.400
 smartphone well I charged it more than 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.430
 half using this charging can 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.920
 be because more but how would work 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.570
 watch smartphone say said smart watch 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.920
 Here's the contact, it all looks on the clock 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.820
 approximately this way or exactly 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.130
 so we dress like that we are contacts 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.300
 to contacts see how it all 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.620
 dress everything here please watch 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.010
 everything looks so well and directly 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.810
 watch yourself and went charging we all see 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.220
 charge again look 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 95 percent charge cool agree 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.150
 really very nice I like straight 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 Generally super duper disconnects very 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.220
 it is difficult I do not know how anyone but now 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.190
 I have even got the hang of it but actually 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.650
 the first time is very difficult 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.170
 a little bit shorter than a bun 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.500
 the only negative of all this is that 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.450
 here without this splash charge the device to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.370
 Unfortunately, it will not work, that is, direct 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.489
 some contacts micro surplus here 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.870
 No, there is also a SIM card slot 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.720
 nano-sim 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.260
 consider nano-sim here and there are also 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.299
 pulse sensors well and these contacts 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.360
 next strap the strap itself opens 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.299
 very easy just i wouldn't say that 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.650
 this strap is the best solution why 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:14.820
 because she is but here I will dress 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.870
 right you just need to wear dress yes yes 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.090
 I wear a watch on my right hand 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.330
 Immediately questions are not asked here as something 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.900
 as that is, I do not on the left and our 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.400
 on hand you dress normally snaps 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.110
 first time i gave it to a person i mean he 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 I could not why there should be shorter under 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.160
 a certain angle which is a defect 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.130
 plus everything i don't like 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.070
 this is this thing this is really uncomfortable 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.040
 the fact that this gum she sticks out 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.330
 and it often happens that on a big hand 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.530
 she slips out and that's it 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.470
 she slipped out and 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.479
 In short, the strap went off and he became 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.410
 more and therefore less comfortable 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:05:00.320
 there is a samsung logo plus everything 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.090
 the bun that she watches are removed from 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.060
 strap accordingly you can other 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.080
 wear a strap in general, that's it like this 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.590
 looks without 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.510
 they look horrible at all 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.990
 without this thing 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:20.210
 but all this can be put on can be put on like 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.250
 want as you do not want well here here I already 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.889
 In principle, I got it, so I already 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.169
 somewhere four times shot just for 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.660
 order to show and like this all this 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.690
 Of course, I look more like a watch 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.500
 I will tell you in detail in the video review but 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.030
 I will tell you that at the first impression of 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.810
 First picking pleased 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.210
 Availability 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.930
 Well, this bun as if she was their 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.610
 the victim is not there and gert 2 also has a nozzle 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.340
 which you put on here already built 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.039
 another 350 milliamp battery then 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.500
 there is like there she was but without 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.050
 recharging and then already there 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.449
 hemorrhoids connect all this slut there 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.030
 Carry yourself that is in 5 10 that is to say 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.710
 more worn if you put on this bun 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.389
 wear a watch does not work by the way let's 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.930
 try so clean for fun it is 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.500
 by fan 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.419
 Yes, well, something terrible 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:21.110
 it will turn out like this it is not even 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:25.820
 it just doesn't make sense to even think in 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:28.970
 Generally yes and what else what moment 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.770
 on this occasion I will say I will say something 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.630
 of course I liked the device 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.760
 I initially found a whole row there 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.770
 cons yes the fact that there will be dirt 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.520
 fall under this rubber pancake for her 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.890
 can be removed 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.650
 then further this adapter is what it is 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.170
 how would you charge back and forth with 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.590
 am bracelet I also have a question answer 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:54.200
 clicking it is no longer free 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.740
 swimming he does not latch everything because well 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.600
 somehow poorly that it seems to me 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.700
 so at a certain angle 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.430
 snapped up fish were a number of flaws 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:10.640
 but there were a lot of advantages to these 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.850
 hours so of course about this we still 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.220
 talk separately in the review and on this i 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.350
 I will be my unpacking bundle and 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.240
