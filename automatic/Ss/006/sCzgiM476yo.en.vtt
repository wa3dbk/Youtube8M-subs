00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.270
 well first of all say that 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.140
 at lunchtime I did not know that 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:19.310
 I was going to be up here Freddy told me 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.750
 but you can throw and what I did to them 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.600
 I'm going to talk a little extra crayon 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.570
 yonic's is born a few weeks ago in the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.119
 start to week in mega de guadalajara 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.189
 we were fortunate to be winners in 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.470
 this contest what we are 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.650
 developing is the combination of a 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.500
 goya with a role -playing game or something like 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.090
 the tag editor and the open hardware or the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.840
 Offender is that it is something that we are passionate about 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.210
 What we did was 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.190
 translate these emotions when 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.980
 You play gotcha to the real world and you can 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.130
 play anywhere, not in what way 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.900
 you have hardware that is a warhol that is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.050
 Connect your phone which will 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.879
 allow to receive impacts and be able to launch 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.989
 and impacts with a laser then on the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.150
 moment that you have this 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.560
 device can go outside 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.869
 look for any other person who 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.490
 have and play with him not then we have 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.050
 a car that plays that you can play 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.119
 every day anywhere with 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.500
 all your friends and if you do not have friends 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.280
 that you can get through 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.850
 the gaming community is not for less 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.830
 we can see images that is the weapon and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 You can play in many ways, not if 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 you want to play alone because you play are the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.479
 new that will not be fun 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.250
 you can play with your friends you can 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.280
 create groups you can create clans or 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.190
 sides and cite not today in the square 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.550
 let's play red against blue 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.880
 and share share and compete for a 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.410
 run that all this is not going to be in a 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.470
 website where you will have your 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.230
 stack your metrics how many times have you 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.420
 died how many times have you killed 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.540
 someone or frozen so it is not so 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.540
 strong 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.120
 we have received many comments from 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.570
 the community we are quite 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.280
 excited because people want me already 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.410
 I started playing this and trying it on 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.300
 people everywhere we are 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.210
 we support in founding inches 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.160
 days in founder and we're going up 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.470
 it's a challenge and a commitment to all 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.210
 you because we have little time for 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.800
 develop the two prototypes and that 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.800
 you can start playing this but 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 if we do not do that fast so 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.340
 we feel we are disappointed 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.050
 you as a public that want to start 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.500
 to play especially those that go to the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.900
 fields who go to campus 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.610
 because they all have the same 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.760
 opportunity to play with our 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.569
 device 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.569
 Thank you
