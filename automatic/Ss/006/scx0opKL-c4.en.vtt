00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.490
 communication is different 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.250
 interest in people culture is different as it is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.400
 everything is interesting because Russia is needed 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.290

 adapted to the sea along the way and already 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.170
 after the first week they deftly moved 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.630
 on masts wednesday how we hit what 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.670
 really only boys and we are very few 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.890
 girls but guys are related to this 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.260
 very well they helped us first 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 time was very hard to overcome your 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.640
 fear for heights but when we overcame 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.720
 we climbed these steps later 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.030
 superb 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.220
 No one helped the contrary, we have 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.900
 helped the guys we studied here 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.770
 specialty sailor second class 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.870
 also all who brought us closer to 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.510
 we studied english tass we were 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.190
 couples learning hands-on activities we 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.780
 passed the exam in sailor 2 class 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.880
 naturally we will get for it 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.870
 crusts 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.450
 practical knowledge is actually very 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.360
 lot next to a comfortable sailing frigate 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.440
 hope crew 3 match new training 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.230
 ship marine state 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.260
 University named after the Russian Admiral 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.850
 Gennady Nevelskoy recently won 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.739
 the Black Sea regatta of large sailboats in 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.350
 class ship 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.110
 it was who I forgot mine was the most 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.400
 end and then 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.680
 strongly caught the wind 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.049
 1 disassemble and 5 degrees ship case 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.709
 at a speed of 13 14 knots it was the most 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.610
 the climax of the event is all 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.550
 happened at night 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.730
 took a few for half an hour 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.819
 tense moment all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.239
 on nerves to platoon 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.310
 but nevertheless the victory was deserved and 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.900
 so I think our guys are less likely 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.459
 The main load of the cream I want to say 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 of course I lay down on the whole crew I can't 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.180
 say that this is a collective victory 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.109
 Of course, the guys got the course and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.969
 Because Abraham 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.280
 load it first of all she does not 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.680
 classmate frigate hope sailing 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.900
