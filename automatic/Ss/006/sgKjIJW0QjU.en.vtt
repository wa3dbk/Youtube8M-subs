quite cleverly some safety zones so I
push<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.380> button<00:01:47.679> here<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:47.920> i<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.159> create

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
push the button here and i can create

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.480 
push the button here and i can create
safety<00:01:48.940> zones<00:01:49.270> either<00:01:49.840> around<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.409> device<00:01:50.709> so

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
safety zones either around the device so

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.940 
safety zones either around the device so
my<00:01:51.759> smartphone<00:01:52.299> say<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.350> child<00:01:53.619> moves

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
my smartphone say if the child moves

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.639 
my smartphone say if the child moves
between<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.149> certain<00:01:55.569> distance<00:01:55.780> outside<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.560> a

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
between a certain distance outside of a

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.340 
between a certain distance outside of a
distance<00:01:57.009> from<00:01:57.100> my<00:01:57.520> smartphone<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.929> will<00:01:59.080> ping

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
distance from my smartphone it will ping

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.930 
distance from my smartphone it will ping
me<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.560> message<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.429> then<00:02:00.549> i<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:00.850> either

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the device so again I maybe they go

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.990 
the device so again I maybe they go
around<00:02:12.750> John<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:14.190> gone<00:02:14.400> round<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> friend's
