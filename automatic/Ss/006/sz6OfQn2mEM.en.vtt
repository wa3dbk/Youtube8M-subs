really neat things about this engine is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.870 
really neat things about this engine is
that<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.320> entire<00:00:34.739> environment<00:00:35.340> everything

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
that the entire environment everything

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.229 
that the entire environment everything
that<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.640> handcrafted<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:39.030> have

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that you see is is handcrafted we have

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350 
that you see is is handcrafted we have
this<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:40.140> technology<00:00:40.680> called<00:00:40.910> mega<00:00:41.910> texture

this this technology called mega texture
which<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.530> its<00:00:43.559> core<00:00:43.980> allows<00:00:44.460> us<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.969> uniquely

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
which at its core allows us to uniquely
