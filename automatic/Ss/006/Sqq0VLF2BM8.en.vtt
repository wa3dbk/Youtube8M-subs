00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
use just the beater to actually put the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.450 
use just the beater to actually put the
hair<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.290> don't<00:03:50.350> use<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.540> magic<00:03:52.540> needle<00:03:52.960> I

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
hair in I don't use the magic needle I

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.450 
hair in I don't use the magic needle I

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460

uh-huh<00:03:58.980> maybe<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.160> just<00:04:00.190> wanted<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.790> come<00:04:01.060> and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
uh-huh maybe I just wanted to come and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.270 
uh-huh maybe I just wanted to come and
share<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.990> with<00:04:02.050> because<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:03.450> love<00:04:04.450> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
share this with because I love it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.840 
share this with because I love it
it<00:04:06.280> took<00:04:06.490> me<00:04:06.700> about<00:04:07.030> our<00:04:07.390> set<00:04:07.690> about<00:04:08.850> five

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
it took me about our set about five

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.120 
it took me about our set about five
hours<00:04:10.120> about<00:04:10.870> five<00:04:11.170> hours<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.650> do<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
hours about five hours to do and the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.530 
hours about five hours to do and the
reason<00:04:12.340> why<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:13.780> because<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:15.340> had<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.090> brave<00:04:16.330> my

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
reason why is because I had to brave my

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.789 
reason why is because I had to brave my
own<00:04:16.720> hair<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:16.989> recently<00:04:17.410> just<00:04:18.010> cut<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:19.500> all<00:04:20.500> my

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
hair off when I say all my hair off all

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.250 
hair off when I say all my hair off all
my<00:04:24.970> hair<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:26.160> had<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.370> cut<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.880> 18<00:04:28.510> inches<00:04:29.020> of

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
my hair I had I cut like 18 inches of

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.670 
my hair I had I cut like 18 inches of

September<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.820> it's<00:04:37.540> probably<00:04:37.990> about<00:04:38.669> that

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
September and it's probably about that

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.360
