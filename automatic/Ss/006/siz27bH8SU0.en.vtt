is I'm really far away from the screen
like<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.329> can't<00:00:42.540> even<00:00:42.600> touch<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> screen<00:00:43.200> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
like I can't even touch the screen which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.049 
like I can't even touch the screen which
is<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> kids<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:44.850> won't<00:00:45.000> be

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
is good for the kids right they won't be

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.120 
is good for the kids right they won't be
touching<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> screen<00:00:45.630> as<00:00:45.780> much<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:47.100> all

touching the screen as much or at all

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.370 
touching the screen as much or at all
hopefully<00:00:47.700> makes<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> very<00:00:48.300> comfortable<00:00:48.570> but

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380
