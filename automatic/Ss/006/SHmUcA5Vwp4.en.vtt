00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hey people the crowds gifhorn not yet 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.080
 one of these dress videos okay you have 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.210
 Pretty this dress message has the whole thing 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 internet quasi eaten and it turns 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.019
 everything is just about this dress for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.460
 those of you watching this video here 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 Before you see the dress info 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 So, about nobody noticed 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520
 there is a little adaptation of you there 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.650
 since this picture is from a dress and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 actually it is black and blue 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 but in this picture it is just like that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 exposed and the color recording is like that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 tuned that it knows for some people 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.090
 and looks golden there you can 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.710
 of course now and people 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.630
 insult that they are the dress exactly 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 the wrong have seen but saving 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.480
 the us now here the picture was like that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 shot that a bit of brightness 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.239
 after there or after there in each case the colors 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.890
 can affect 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 and when we all consider that ours 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 Monitors and cell phones all on 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690
 different brightness levels 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.129
 are set then it is not 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.899
 so unlikely that your own like that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 see and the others are different 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.989
 There is even a video by now 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.579
 It only takes two minutes to get there 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.469
 English I will link you below 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.969
 That explains why the one is human 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.670
 so see and the other people that 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 By the way, it was different with me 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 I became both last night 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 snatched from sleep because my friends 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 woke me up and asked 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 which color has this dress where 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.799
 Do not overslept, replied Herr Horn 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 it is brown brown yes and what color 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:27.270
 yet, and so I know it first 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.380
 white and brown brown gold there is not 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.180
 too much difference in any case 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.799
 I first saw the white and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.420
 she woke up this morning after waking up 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.040
 me the thing shown again and me 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 thought ice-cold become completely different 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.130
 picture because I have blue and once 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 have seen black and have both times 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 I saw it on her phone that is 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.439
 the brightness levels are both equal 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.600
 and yet I have two different ones 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.340
 I even thought color intensity 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 that any special page would be 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.460
 if you yourself look at it you just 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.590
 sees a color and then somebody has to 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 Other shows then registered the mobile phone 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 just above the front camera and directs the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.439
 to the side that someone else 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.310
 there is another look and shows 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.140
 picture what the colors changed a little 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.820
 This whole dress thing reminds me 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.290
 the situation of earlier than us 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000
 found out that a friend of 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.250
 Do not roll his tongue together 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.580
 So he could not do that here 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.370
 do 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.510
 and that was totally illogical to us 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.650
 It's super easy you have to 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.849
 after all, only that and that and that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.800
 do and that's super easy 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.510
 just as is that with the dress 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.130
 so that you have to be much easier 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.750
 you just look and it is 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.340
 black and blue resp 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.780
 the others have those but are wrong 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.190
 you know that it's fun a blue 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.739
 we should all be from this 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.550
 very well known but pretty much 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.400
 inconsequential thing if we are honest 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.220
 are a teaching pull for example it 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.080
 is not everything as it seems or 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.130
 is more behind it than you think so 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.720
 take a closer look 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.489
 no clue any rules will 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.440
 But let's go , we are here 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.880
 finally in German lessons so 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.860
 I ask you the same as all 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.780
 others will also do what color 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.340
 Do you really see that as the picture 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.690
 should not have seen then 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.040
 check out the video below 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.019
 have linked to because it's definitely 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.519
 fall and then comes around again 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.810
 to write what color you saw 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.670
 we can see each other next time 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.709
 leisure buck have stayed until then 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.810
 on the outside do not argue 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.190
 because of the dress with anyone that 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.060
 Somebody wrong with the colors I have 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.480
 said do not argue 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.480
 and until then loud black
