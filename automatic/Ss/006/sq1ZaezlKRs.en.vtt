least change the spark plugs for the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.390 
least change the spark plugs for the
most<00:00:20.550> part<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:22.310> got<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.430> mm<00:00:23.939> max<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> myself

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
most part I got my mm max in myself

eeap's extension every five eighths it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
eeap's extension every five eighths it's
got<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> rubber<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> spark

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
got the rubber and also is for the spark

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.160 
got the rubber and also is for the spark
plugs

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
plugs

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.300 
plugs
it's<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> rubber<00:01:12.979> need<00:01:13.979> an<00:01:14.130> extension

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's got the rubber need an extension

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
it's got the rubber need an extension
four<00:01:17.310> inches<00:01:17.610> three<00:01:17.820> inches<00:01:18.619> fortunately<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
four inches three inches fortunately I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.810 
four inches three inches fortunately I
have<00:01:20.400> maybe<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.210> inch<00:01:25.970> that's<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.180> leg

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
have maybe like a two inch that's my leg

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
have maybe like a two inch that's my leg
extension<00:01:30.229> anyway<00:01:31.229> basically<00:01:31.470> once<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> take

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
extension anyway basically once you take

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
extension anyway basically once you take
the<00:01:32.220> cover<00:01:32.400> off<00:01:32.570> especially<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> type

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the cover off especially for this type

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
the cover off especially for this type
of<00:01:34.380> call<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> 2,000<00:01:35.189> max<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.610> get

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
of call from the 2,000 max and we get

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.289 
of call from the 2,000 max and we get
the<00:01:36.420> three<00:01:36.689> coils<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.380> got<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.030> then

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the three coils you got one two and then

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.010 
the three coils you got one two and then
three<00:01:41.420> which<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:44.750> they<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
three which look like this they got the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.060 
three which look like this they got the
little<00:01:46.229> covers<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
little covers on it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
little covers on it
that's<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.759> spark<00:01:48.030> plug<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:49.110> -<00:01:49.380> looks

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that's the spark plug on which - looks

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's the spark plug on which - looks
good

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
good

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.810 
good
so<00:01:52.750> basically<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.890> know<00:01:54.010> as<00:01:54.370> long<00:01:54.520> as<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.700> got

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
so basically you know as long as you got

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.950 
so basically you know as long as you got
a<00:01:55.320> wrench<00:01:56.320> socket<00:01:57.300> 5/8<00:01:58.300> socket<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.900> extension

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
a wrench socket 5/8 socket and extension

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:07.200 
a wrench socket 5/8 socket and extension
I<00:01:59.650> don't<00:02:00.010> know<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.370> I<00:02:00.460> got<00:02:00.640> my<00:02:00.790> own<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:07.030> how

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
I don't know but I got my own that's how

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.790 
I don't know but I got my own that's how
you<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.570> know<00:02:07.690> that's<00:02:08.110> what<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.679> mainly<00:02:08.979> need

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you you know that's what you mainly need

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.360 
you you know that's what you mainly need
no<00:02:11.800> with<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> extension<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:14.220> what<00:02:15.220> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
no with the extension you know what you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.710 
no with the extension you know what you
use<00:02:15.520> with<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:16.800> wrench<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:19.330> what<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.570> use

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
use with the wrench that's what you use

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:39.350 
use with the wrench that's what you use
to<00:02:19.750> get<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:23.080> get<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.260> socket<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:36.570> quick

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
to get the to get the socket on quick

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.600 
to get the to get the socket on quick
cannot<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.660> back<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:43.120> yeah<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.440> know

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
cannot be right back but yeah you know

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.800 
cannot be right back but yeah you know
we<00:02:45.610> got<00:02:45.640> different<00:02:46.209> prices<00:02:46.600> for<00:02:46.630> different

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
we got different prices for different

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.770 
we got different prices for different
types<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.290> spark<00:02:47.530> plugs<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:47.830> stuff<00:02:48.100> like<00:02:48.280> that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
types of spark plugs and stuff like that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.560 
types of spark plugs and stuff like that
and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:50.020> again<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:51.130> middle<00:02:51.459> branch<00:02:51.640> you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
and then again the middle branch you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.560 
and then again the middle branch you
know<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.959> four<00:02:53.140> dollar<00:02:53.320> ones<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:55.300> most

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
know like the four dollar ones the most

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.160 
know like the four dollar ones the most
expensive<00:02:55.989> ones<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.709> 1095<00:02:57.430> ones<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
expensive ones I like the 1095 ones I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.190 
expensive ones I like the 1095 ones I
think<00:02:59.560> those<00:02:59.680> are<00:02:59.709> like<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> Platinum<00:03:00.250> ones

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
think those are like the Platinum ones

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.440 
think those are like the Platinum ones
the<00:03:02.200> real<00:03:02.410> real<00:03:02.680> good<00:03:03.280> ones<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.730> got<00:03:04.300> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the real real good ones I got the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:17.610 
the real real good ones I got the
regular<00:03:04.810> G<00:03:05.590> sparks<00:03:06.209> all<00:03:07.209> right<00:03:16.410> fresh<00:03:17.410> and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
regular G sparks all right fresh and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.400 
regular G sparks all right fresh and
