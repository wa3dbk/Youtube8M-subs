favorites<00:04:00.550> I'd<00:04:00.700> say<00:04:00.910> yes<00:04:01.330> especially<00:04:01.510> with

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
favorites I'd say yes especially with

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.940

the<00:04:01.900> way<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.110> they<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.470> played<00:04:02.650> right<00:04:02.830> now

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
the way that they just played right now

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.920 
the way that they just played right now
I<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:03.460> though<00:04:03.640> fire<00:04:03.940> was<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.780> good

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
I think though fire was in a good

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.930 
I think though fire was in a good
position<00:04:05.110> they<00:04:05.500> were<00:04:05.560> close<00:04:05.860> enough<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.400> think

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
position they were close enough I think

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.160 
position they were close enough I think
if<00:04:07.030> they<00:04:07.120> make<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.300> adjustment<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.870> giving

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
if they make the adjustment of giving

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.260 
if they make the adjustment of giving
mike<00:04:08.380> a<00:04:08.410> little<00:04:08.830> bit<00:04:08.950> more<00:04:09.070> farm<00:04:09.370> there<00:04:09.610> maybe

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
mike a little bit more farm there maybe

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.110 
mike a little bit more farm there maybe
they<00:04:10.480> can<00:04:10.630> get<00:04:10.750> stuff
