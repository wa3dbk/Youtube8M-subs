 Pay attention to this picture, just look at yourself. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 you think this is what you think this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 image is what the rap tension for the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.599
 traces all over the sky that image that 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.880
 Are you seeing this image that you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.160
 watching with me was filmed in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.550
 New IguaÃ§u in the Baixada Fluminense and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 left all the residents worried 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 scared 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.449
 reporter Leandro Stoliar went to the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.469
 downloaded to try to find out what is 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.570
 this will accompany a mysterious light 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.520
 crosses the river sky images were 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.350
 recorded by a resident of new iguacu 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.660
 in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.899
 the shiny object looks like it falls off 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 clouds and leaves a trail of smoke 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 reddish on the way looks like a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.250
 blaze of fire even the spot left 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 locals scared carlos 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 was one of the recipe quite afraid 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 suddenly fell next to us we do not have 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.890
 much that making this video shows the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 when the object disappears in the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 sky 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.170
 Ana Paula was the one who recorded the images was 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.510
 exactly here I was with my husband 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.710
 and my daughter was at the diner was 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 very hot 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.780
 then suddenly I looked there and saw a 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.549
 White business fell on and soon came on 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
 my mind would be the meteor because 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.290
 in proportion as he fell he would light 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.210
 that fire light is not 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 the sky has now become a cause for concern 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 worldwide here in rio de janeiro 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.009
 more than 20 people filmed the phenomenon 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.619
 but for experts the chance of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.150
 unidentified object being a meteor 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.250
 is discarded 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.979
 carlos roberto is an astronomer and teacher 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.229
 the Federal River University it 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.079
 analyzed the images and denied any 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.460
 relation to the 10- tonne meteor 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.229
 that hit russia 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.560
 the images that we see there for the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.149
 are not meteorites 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.470
 despite the fact that in the case of engines in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.720
 russia now has a lot of people believing 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.930
 which may be meteorites or 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
 already notified more likely 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 it is a plane at speed that is 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.900
 moving is a typical speed of a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.479
 aircraft cruise is good in well to 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.140
 mainland sail whatever whatever 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.630
 for 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.280
 the luminous trail in the river sky left 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.590
 a lot of people on alert 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.950
 how fell there can fall here no one is 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.950
