trouble a couple of times throughout the
program<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.270> think<00:04:08.330> on<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.660> triple<00:04:08.930> axel<00:04:09.080> the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
program I think on the triple axel the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.730 
program I think on the triple axel the
first<00:04:10.100> jump<00:04:10.550> there<00:04:10.820> he<00:04:11.360> felt<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.320> was<00:04:12.470> worse

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
first jump there he felt it was worse

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.070 
first jump there he felt it was worse
than<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:13.130> actually<00:04:13.250> was<00:04:13.520> got<00:04:14.450> right<00:04:14.720> down<00:04:14.750> in

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
than it actually was got right down in

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
than it actually was got right down in
the<00:04:15.170> knee<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.500> think<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.800> moment<00:04:16.040> he

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
the knee and I think for a moment he

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.890 
the knee and I think for a moment he
thought<00:04:16.250> he<00:04:16.310> was<00:04:16.430> going<00:04:16.670> down<00:04:16.850> but<00:04:16.880> he<00:04:17.780> was

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
thought he was going down but he was

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.920 
thought he was going down but he was
able<00:04:18.140> to<00:04:18.170> save<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.370> from<00:04:20.120> then<00:04:20.359> on<00:04:20.540> in<00:04:20.750> he

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
able to save it and from then on in he

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.620 
able to save it and from then on in he
really<00:04:21.200> didn't<00:04:21.620> look<00:04:21.769> back<00:04:22.010> did<00:04:22.220> he<00:04:22.630> good

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
really didn't look back did he good
