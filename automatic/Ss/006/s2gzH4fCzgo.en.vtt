00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
screen is of that of the blackberries

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
screen is of that of the blackberries
and<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> battery<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.420> 1250<00:01:22.350> milliamp

and the battery it has is 1250 milliamp

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
and the battery it has is 1250 milliamp
hour<00:01:23.369> battery<00:01:23.520> while<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> Nexus<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.200> here

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hour battery while the Nexus over here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.289 
hour battery while the Nexus over here
has<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.670> 1750<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.780> galaxy<00:01:28.170> note<00:01:28.350> 2<00:01:28.590> has<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
has a 1750 and the galaxy note 2 has a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
3100 milliamp hour battery so this lasts

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
3100 milliamp hour battery so this lasts
almost<00:01:33.420> two<00:01:33.869> days<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.320> terms<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.100> usage<00:01:35.340> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
almost two days in terms of usage this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
almost two days in terms of usage this
lasts<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.159> think<00:01:38.159> maybe<00:01:38.400> 10<00:01:39.150> hours<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
lasts I think maybe 10 hours and this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
lasts I think maybe 10 hours and this
last<00:01:41.420> almost<00:01:42.420> 20<00:01:43.290> hours<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
last almost 20 hours so that is the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
last almost 20 hours so that is the
difference<00:01:46.740> between<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.220> batteries<00:01:47.610> now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
difference between the batteries now

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.139 
difference between the batteries now
this<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> 3<00:01:48.810> megapixel<00:01:48.960> camera<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.909> has<00:01:51.119> a
