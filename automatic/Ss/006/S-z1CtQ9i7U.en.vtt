Tools I've been asked to show how to do

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.050 
Tools I've been asked to show how to do
it<00:00:15.170> the<00:00:15.260> other<00:00:15.289> way<00:00:15.559> which<00:00:16.129> is<00:00:16.160> very<00:00:16.760> similar

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
it the other way which is very similar

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.870 
it the other way which is very similar
but<00:00:17.930> I'd<00:00:18.080> go<00:00:18.260> through<00:00:18.440> it<00:00:18.530> anyway<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.640> the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
but I'd go through it anyway so the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.740 
but I'd go through it anyway so the
first<00:00:20.060> thing<00:00:20.210> you<00:00:20.300> want<00:00:20.420> to<00:00:20.450> do<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:20.630> obviously

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
first thing you want to do is obviously

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.870 
first thing you want to do is obviously
get<00:00:21.109> your<00:00:21.230> track<00:00:21.529> make<00:00:21.980> sure<00:00:22.010> that<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:22.730> have

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
get your track make sure that you have

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.810 
get your track make sure that you have
no<00:00:23.119> elastic<00:00:23.599> audio<00:00:23.830> on<00:00:24.830> any<00:00:25.400> of<00:00:25.460> your<00:00:25.580> tracks

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
no elastic audio on any of your tracks

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.370 
no elastic audio on any of your tracks
because<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.210> won't<00:00:26.449> work<00:00:26.660> it's<00:00:27.109> you<00:00:27.199> need<00:00:27.320> to

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
because that won't work it's you need to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.480 
because that won't work it's you need to
make<00:00:27.529> sure<00:00:27.560> all<00:00:27.740> your<00:00:27.859> tracks<00:00:28.130> rather

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
make sure all your tracks rather

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.359 
make sure all your tracks rather
rendered<00:00:29.089> and<00:00:29.779> ready<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:30.140> go<00:00:30.439> then<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.250> other

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
rendered and ready to go then the other

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.530 
rendered and ready to go then the other
thing<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.580> course<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:31.939> remember<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.390> the

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
thing of course to remember is the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.940 
thing of course to remember is the
plugins<00:00:33.080> are<00:00:33.170> not<00:00:33.260> gonna<00:00:33.380> go<00:00:33.560> across<00:00:33.800> either

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
plugins are not gonna go across either

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.340 
plugins are not gonna go across either
so<00:00:34.340> I<00:00:34.550> would<00:00:34.850> tend<00:00:35.150> to<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:35.630> disable<00:00:35.930> them<00:00:36.230> all

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
so I would tend to just disable them all

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.930 
so I would tend to just disable them all
straight<00:00:36.560> away<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.280> then<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:37.789> know

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
straight away and then you know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.260 
straight away and then you know
straightaway<00:00:38.390> when<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.809> use<00:00:39.469> these<00:00:40.030> later<00:00:41.030> on

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
straightaway when you use these later on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.939 
straightaway when you use these later on
that<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:41.719> is<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:41.989> track<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.440> all<00:00:42.530> here<00:00:42.739> so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
different channels so it comes if we go

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.090 
different channels so it comes if we go
to<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.269> there<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.390> can<00:03:34.540> see<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.739> different

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
to the there we can see the different

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.820 
to the there we can see the different
channels<00:03:38.940> or<00:03:39.940> bought-in<00:03:40.410> can<00:03:41.410> bring<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.680> out

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
channels or bought-in can bring that out

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.410 
channels or bought-in can bring that out
make<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.489> smaller<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:44.019> there<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.410> our<00:03:44.560> track

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
make that smaller and there is our track

00:03:45.420 --> 00:04:04.110 
make that smaller and there is our track
let's<00:03:46.420> play<00:03:46.750> that

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.800 

and<00:04:05.120> there<00:04:05.510> we<00:04:05.630> are

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and there we are

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.590 
and there we are
it<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:07.490> whole<00:04:07.670> track<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.270> in<00:04:08.420> there
