in and RB on a flat to the right the
reason<00:00:43.350> why<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.559> put<00:00:43.710> our<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> flat<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
reason why we put our be on a flat to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.299 
reason why we put our be on a flat to
the<00:00:44.760> right<00:00:44.969> pretty<00:00:45.930> much<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.829> use<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the right pretty much we use them as a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.959 
the right pretty much we use them as a
decoy<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.320> flat<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.399> purple<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
decoy if they have a flat or purple on

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
decoy if they have a flat or purple on
that<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.329> side<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> drag

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
that right side they are going to drag

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.389 
that right side they are going to drag
down<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> flat<00:00:54.270> leaving<00:00:54.840> why<00:00:55.020> open<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
down to the flat leaving why open on the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.920 
down to the flat leaving why open on the
crossing<00:00:56.760> route<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.120> he<00:00:57.449> comes<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
crossing route as he comes to the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.160 
crossing route as he comes to the
sideline<00:00:58.730> we<00:00:59.730> put<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> slant<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
sideline we put a on a slant in just to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
sideline we put a on a slant in just to
have<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.469> crossing<00:01:01.890> routes<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> middle

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
have two crossing routes to the middle

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030 
have two crossing routes to the middle
and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> big<00:01:04.350> crossing<00:01:04.799> route

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and then we have the big crossing route

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940 
and then we have the big crossing route
X<00:01:05.339> against<00:01:06.270> zone<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.530> begets

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
X against zone so you can see begets

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
X against zone so you can see begets
open<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.880> inside<00:01:09.299> precision<00:01:09.810> every<00:01:10.080> time

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
open with inside precision every time

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500 
open with inside precision every time
against<00:01:10.530> man<00:01:10.770> press<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> two

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
against man press and you have the two

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.700 
against man press and you have the two
crossing<00:01:12.930> routes<00:01:13.110> working<00:01:13.560> their<00:01:13.680> way

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
crossing routes working their way

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.460 
crossing routes working their way
getting<00:01:14.310> open<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.850> well<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.930> best<00:01:16.140> part<00:01:16.229> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
getting open as well the best part about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.770 
getting open as well the best part about
those<00:01:16.830> two<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.220> they<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.759> bump<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:18.479> each

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
those two is they do not bump into each

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.679 
those two is they do not bump into each
other<00:01:18.960> since<00:01:19.650> they're<00:01:19.860> attacking<00:01:20.689> slightly

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
other since they're attacking slightly

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.920 
other since they're attacking slightly
different<00:01:22.080> levels<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> field<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
different levels of the field I

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.719 
different levels of the field I
personally<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> play<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.430> it's

very simple it's easy to read we have
routes<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> kill<00:01:29.610> man<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:30.720> also

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
routes that kill man and we're also

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410 
routes that kill man and we're also
attacking<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.710> zone<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.150> flooding<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> at

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
attacking the zone and flooding it at

how the hook zones are playing I'm gonna
dime<00:04:04.830> cover<00:04:05.160> two<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.880> slot<00:04:06.150> corners<00:04:06.600> are
