00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
quickly discuss compression bags as you
can<00:00:19.529> see<00:00:19.800> these<00:00:20.039> two<00:00:20.279> sleeping<00:00:20.730> bags<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.210> the

the right
that's<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> compression<00:00:26.369> bag<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
that's the compression bag and this is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
that's the compression bag and this is
the<00:00:27.720> normal<00:00:27.930> bag<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.680> sleeping<00:00:29.070> bags<00:00:29.279> will

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the normal bag the sleeping bags will

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.790 
the normal bag the sleeping bags will
come<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.150> particular<00:00:30.660> Kelty<00:00:31.380> bag

so<00:00:33.230> again<00:00:35.059> compression<00:00:36.059> bags<00:00:36.300> why<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:37.200> them

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so again compression bags why get them

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.840 
so again compression bags why get them
they<00:00:38.010> save<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.879> ton<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.719> room<00:00:40.579> your<00:00:41.579> clothes

at<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.620> compression<00:00:47.039> bag<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
at this compression bag we're going to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
at this compression bag we're going to
start<00:00:48.180> first<00:00:52.010> see<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.460> stuff<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
start first see here you just stuff it

start first see here you just stuff it
and<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:55.050> cinch<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.730> do

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and you cinch it and that's how you do

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
and you cinch it and that's how you do

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it so that's a four part why it's so big

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.650 
it so that's a four part why it's so big
with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> compression<00:01:00.539> bag<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:03.090> doesn't<00:01:03.480> have

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
with the compression bag it doesn't have

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.070 
with the compression bag it doesn't have
the<00:01:03.989> cinch<00:01:05.180> system<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.360> top<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.960> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the cinch system on top what it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
the cinch system on top what it's
actually<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> guys<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.820> seen

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
straps you've got four of them across
the<00:01:43.970> outcrop<00:01:44.970> across<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> compression<00:01:45.840> bag<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the outcrop across a compression bag and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
the outcrop across a compression bag and
what<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.490> end<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.880> cinching<00:01:48.420> these<00:01:48.600> down

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
what you do end up cinching these down

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.429 
what you do end up cinching these down
and<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:49.740> takes<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:51.170> bag<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and that's what really takes the bag and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
and that's what really takes the bag and
squishes<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.979> down<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> more<00:01:53.579> manageable

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
squishes it down to a more manageable

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
squishes it down to a more manageable
level<00:01:54.860> huh<00:01:56.600> hey<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.899> got<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.259> seal<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
level huh hey I just got the seal of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
level huh hey I just got the seal of
approval<00:01:58.740> from<00:01:59.189> trout<00:02:01.219> so<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
approval from trout so this one is I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.320 
approval from trout so this one is I
believe<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.770> brand<00:02:05.130> name<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.659> sea2summit

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
believe the brand name is sea2summit

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.620 
believe the brand name is sea2summit
and<00:02:08.570> I<00:02:09.560> think<00:02:09.830> that's<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.490> model<00:02:10.700> event<00:02:11.270> if

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
and I think that's the model event if

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.380 
and I think that's the model event if
not<00:02:12.350> all<00:02:12.590> annotate<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.700> correct<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.300> if

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
not all annotate that and correct it if

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.900 
not all annotate that and correct it if
I'm<00:02:14.570> incorrect<00:02:15.070> but<00:02:16.070> this<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> waterproof

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
I'm incorrect but this is a waterproof

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'm incorrect but this is a waterproof
fabric<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.260> says<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.680> really<00:02:18.830> haven't

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
fabric so it says I really haven't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.460 
fabric so it says I really haven't
tested<00:02:19.400> that<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.970> still<00:02:20.480> put<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> garbage<00:02:21.050> bag<00:02:21.260> in

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
tested that I still put a garbage bag in

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.720 
tested that I still put a garbage bag in
here<00:02:21.710> just<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.700> case<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.470> far<00:02:24.740> so

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
here just just in case and so far so

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.170 
here just just in case and so far so
good

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
good

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.360 
good
I've<00:02:26.540> had<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.870> for<00:02:26.990> about<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.200> season<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.920> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
I've had it for about a season and it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.530 
I've had it for about a season and it's
holding<00:02:28.730> up<00:02:28.880> pretty<00:02:29.060> good

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
holding up pretty good

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.070 
holding up pretty good
my<00:02:30.050> concern<00:02:30.590> mainly<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.810> course

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
my concern mainly on this is of course

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.500 
my concern mainly on this is of course
any<00:02:33.380> compression<00:02:33.860> bag<00:02:34.220> you're<00:02:34.880> going<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.330> get

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
any compression bag you're going to get

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.780 
any compression bag you're going to get
the<00:02:35.600> stress<00:02:35.960> spots<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.430> see<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
the stress spots so you can see this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.320 
the stress spots so you can see this
here<00:02:38.120> where<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:39.400> where<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.550> stitching<00:02:41.120> is

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
here where the where the stitching is

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.020 
here where the where the stitching is
being<00:02:41.660> pulled<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.380> little<00:02:42.620> bit<00:02:42.800> now<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:43.790> far

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
being pulled a little bit now so far

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.650 
being pulled a little bit now so far
that<00:02:44.210> hasn't<00:02:44.390> been<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.600> problem<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:46.390> we'll<00:02:47.390> see

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
that hasn't been a problem so we'll see

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.320 
that hasn't been a problem so we'll see
we'll<00:02:47.930> see<00:02:47.960> over<00:02:48.230> long-term<00:02:48.440> use<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:50.060> I'm

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
we'll see over long-term use but so I'm

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.690 
we'll see over long-term use but so I'm
not<00:02:50.480> necessarily<00:02:50.660> recommending<00:02:51.320> this<00:02:52.160> per<00:02:52.430> se

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
not necessarily recommending this per se

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.890 
not necessarily recommending this per se
although<00:02:53.590> for<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> use<00:02:55.000> thus<00:02:56.000> far<00:02:56.330> I<00:02:56.540> would

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
although for the use thus far I would

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.680 
although for the use thus far I would
but<00:02:57.860> long<00:02:58.130> term<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.640> just<00:02:58.850> don't<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.210> I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
but long term I just don't have that I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.620 
but long term I just don't have that I
have<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.380> experience<00:03:00.530> yet<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.630> there's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
have that experience yet and there's

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.390 
have that experience yet and there's
something<00:03:02.810> else<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:03.080> can<00:03:03.320> mention<00:03:03.470> all<00:03:03.710> price<00:03:04.040> I

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
something else I can mention all price I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.430 
something else I can mention all price I
can't<00:03:05.240> remember<00:03:05.390> on<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.840> one<00:03:05.960> as<00:03:06.080> I<00:03:06.200> think

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
can't remember on this one as I think

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.370 
can't remember on this one as I think
was<00:03:06.590> about<00:03:06.680> $30.00<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:09.050> about<00:03:09.320> a

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
was about $30.00 and it's about a

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.560 
was about $30.00 and it's about a
mid-range<00:03:10.070> bag<00:03:10.490> there's<00:03:10.820> some<00:03:11.000> cheaper<00:03:11.360> ones

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
mid-range bag there's some cheaper ones

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.480 
mid-range bag there's some cheaper ones
but<00:03:12.440> there's<00:03:12.620> certainly<00:03:12.980> more<00:03:13.220> expensive

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
but there's certainly more expensive

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.400 
but there's certainly more expensive
ones<00:03:14.000> out<00:03:14.150> there<00:03:14.330> too<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.780> decided<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.290> go<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
ones out there too and I decided to go a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.070 
ones out there too and I decided to go a
little<00:03:15.560> bit<00:03:15.770> middle-of-the-road<00:03:16.520> I<00:03:17.080> still

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
little bit middle-of-the-road I still

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.860 
little bit middle-of-the-road I still
need<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> redo<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.709> review<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.520> Kelty<00:03:19.970> but

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
need to redo a review on the Kelty but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.590 
need to redo a review on the Kelty but
celtic<00:03:21.620> coyote<00:03:22.010> I<00:03:22.190> just<00:03:23.060> haven't<00:03:23.300> gotten<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
celtic coyote I just haven't gotten to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.210 
celtic coyote I just haven't gotten to
it<00:03:23.690> yet<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.350> again<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.830> reasons<00:03:24.860> I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
it yet but again one of the reasons I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.530 
it yet but again one of the reasons I
bought<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.850> because<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.120> knew<00:03:26.270> I'd<00:03:26.420> be

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
bought this is because I knew I'd be

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.510 
bought this is because I knew I'd be
taking<00:03:26.900> two<00:03:27.050> people<00:03:27.380> up<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.890> even<00:03:28.130> three<00:03:28.400> at

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
taking two people up and even three at

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.150 
taking two people up and even three at
times<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.690> I'd<00:03:30.020> have<00:03:30.170> to<00:03:30.320> be<00:03:30.440> packing<00:03:30.920> two

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
times so I'd have to be packing two

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.670 
times so I'd have to be packing two
sleeping<00:03:31.610> bags<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.270> in<00:03:33.110> part<00:03:33.410> that's<00:03:33.590> what

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
sleeping bags and in part that's what

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.050 
sleeping bags and in part that's what
drove<00:03:33.860> me<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.070> get<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> compression<00:03:35.180> bag<00:03:35.330> also

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
drove me to get a compression bag also

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.699 
drove me to get a compression bag also
so<00:03:38.060> as<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.390> can<00:03:38.510> see<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:41.090> coyote<00:03:41.540> there<00:03:42.500> is

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
so as you can see in the coyote there is

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.430 
so as you can see in the coyote there is
no<00:03:42.980> way<00:03:43.280> well<00:03:44.120> actually<00:03:44.330> would<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.170> would

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
no way well actually would this would

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.530 
no way well actually would this would
fit<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:46.100> big<00:03:46.340> one<00:03:46.550> but<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:47.180> I'm<00:03:47.270> not<00:03:47.420> going

and I realize this probably isn't an

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.409 
and I realize this probably isn't an
issue<00:05:02.560> for<00:05:02.710> most<00:05:02.979> but<00:05:03.849> I'm<00:05:03.940> going<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.120> put<00:05:04.330> it
