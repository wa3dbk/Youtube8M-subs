00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.700
 my job is to make 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.289
 deliveries on two multi sectors of 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.939
 kidnapping for our clients of that all 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.980
 the day we specialize in the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.320
 packages of less than 30 kg our types of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.689
 clients it's the pharmacy industry 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.460
 the shops we touch absolutely all 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.019
 sectors for our deliveries we 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.010
 have vehicles of 14 cubic meters 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.239
 what we are all alone 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.690
 they are super comfortable today 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.100
 we start at 6:30 on the platform we wait 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.330
 other goods that arrive we have 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.979
 rowed directional ticket they 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.269
 indicate our packages to take after we 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.739
 is the sorting of the tour after the stroke 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.479
 of the tour have made a slip of 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.909
 delivery after charging his vehicle 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.710
 as it should after the ramparts have 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.970
 delivered his sector host defined the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.619
 customers yes it's a little bit always the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.330
 same because we all have pretty much 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.619
 allocated sectors there are links 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.850
 that are being created in this country we are 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.049
 responsible for his sector one is 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.610
 responsible for his clients in the 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.379
 special of these packages it's up to us to 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.580
 manage you have to know how to manage yourself 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.409
 first also work a lot 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.880
 a lot with the map is what the gps 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.290
 we can make them a right shot a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.330
 blow to the left a blow to the bar in good 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.890
 term to the ccl not worth it is a 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.759
 job that has no routine we do not have 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.250
 time to be bored 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.380
 it's constantly active it's his mouth 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 and you have to go fast and well 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.729
 but security at the same time 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.130
 all our drivers were trained to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.810
 eco-driving 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390
 that's the first thing is the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.470
 second thing is that we totally 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.230
 redefined our distribution sector 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 by sectoring it so that the 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.220
 same driver is required to do 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.600
 that an area and that is not crossing 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.130
 between drivers because that's 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.230
 also unnecessary consumption 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.390
 diesel is also time spent 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.090
 the idea is to optimize to the maximum of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.040
 way to consume less reduce the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.900
 volume and workload 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970
 we learned eco-driving we learned to 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.530
 manage a vehicle brought his vehicle 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.690
 to consume less is to take one's 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.890
 vehicle gently correctly always 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.000
 take the lead as in the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 transport like those there have always 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.619
 advocated to accelerate when it is necessary 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.880
 not accelerate in his descent to serve himself 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.430
 with his hand his vehicle to take him 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:18.330
 where it is necessary is the company that we 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.500
 had an internship then in the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.120
 framework the drivers information and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.600
 commercial vehicle drivers 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.760
 light 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.680
 I sensitize trainees to have a 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
 flexible conduct so why because 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.430
 well if I accelerate too much I see too much 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.500
 braked if I stop being dared because 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.000
 I accelerated too much and we are very 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.800
 concerned about the consumption of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.090
 fuels obviously we will do 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.690
 also pay attention to the flashes of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.980
 pneumatic 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.450
 because a pressure drop to be 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.330
 the tiguan or cause to cause a 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.840
 consumption about a little more than 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.880
 10% 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840
 on the other hand we will also pay attention 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.760
 vehicle maintenance 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 so because she's going a wrong vehicle 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
 serviced air filters to change 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.950
 it will make us over-consumption 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.670
 for driving a vehicle 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.560
 electric 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.459
 I mention it because the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.830
 vehicle makes a lot less noise 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.239
 so we ask our drivers to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.920
 be very careful because the 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.780
 pedestrian road users will see it 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 but will not hear him conduct 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.470
 was not that driving a vehicle 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.660
 it's a lot of little things 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.230
 who wants to do that it will be a good 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 driver 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.680
 before each departure I teach them the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.570
 vehicle support 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.860
 you will also control the plugs 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.840
 closing the caps if it's ok 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.030
 shut here immediately confess 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.440
 spend the months the must be actor of the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.660
 sustainable development for a driver 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.610
 delivery driver a delivery driver on a 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.170
 light commercial vehicle it's for the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.819
 environmental dimension 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.800
 limit the carbon footprint of 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.540
 vehicle by adopting a flexible driving 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.459
 to reduce the consumption of 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.300
 fuel 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.190
 it's looking after the state and 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.510
 operation of the vehicle and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.849
 the supplements and the full with 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.160
 precision for the economic dimension 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.290
 organized the tour so 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.020
 optimized by avoiding kilometers 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.030
 useless is to use technologies 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.010
 computerized data transmission 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.040
 to reduce the consumption of 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.360
 paper to save time be actor of the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.489
 sustainable development is for the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.050
 social dimension take into account the 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.790
 silent character of vehicles 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.440
 electric and know how to attract 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.810
 pedestrian attention to diminish 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.250
 the risk of an accident is to make sure 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.260
 the safety of other categories 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.430
 of users in particular 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.430
 urban and during deliveries
