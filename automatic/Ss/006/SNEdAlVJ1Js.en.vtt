00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
and then it explodes into the fast part

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.660 
and then it explodes into the fast part
which<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.409> sort<00:01:28.859> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> majority<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.579> the

really<00:01:43.109> an<00:01:43.829> anomaly<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
really an anomaly because the it's so

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.590 
really an anomaly because the it's so

well put together and it's so packaged

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
well put together and it's so packaged
up<00:01:48.749> nicely<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.740> different
