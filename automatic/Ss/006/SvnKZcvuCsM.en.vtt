00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello together and nice that we are there 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.690
 let it be another attila totally 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.880
 Nations cup from me today with the genes 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 one of the nation from the vikings before 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 calls for a lot here too 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.130
 The units will then sit down 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 the same time we have so bad 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
 many units are breaking the moral 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 which is brilliant we have very good axis 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.740
 yes , we also have relatively good 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 However, we almost have cavalry 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.240
 no televised and that to wish 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 left but okay left going on generally on 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.560
 a total of three pieces the Nordic 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 general so warlord really 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 not exactly dollar is this city 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.420
 units general leader of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.070
 Nordic raiders a little better 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.140
 but they are still pretty fragile 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.940
 is just for canada where true even 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
 Do not risk and be the leader of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840
 wikinger is still on it and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.730
 that we have one more because of that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 It can be hard to beat 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 infantry have a total of four pieces 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 nordic herbern bavarian heavy 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 fighter nordic elite fighter and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 nordic sparmeister 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.910
 we now rely on the Nordic 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 Sergeant wise , everyone is good 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.620
 against white cavalry as a scale 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 it 's pretty handy and the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 Nordic bar fight fighters have stop 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.240
 advantage for us that it is essential 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.979
 better so a little faster than 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.960
 the others here are hard to see now 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.770
 and very heavy and yet sufficient 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 and you can get ready 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 Rather , we do not need them 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 peak infantry of the north are not 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.150
 just the German so so that the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.340
 me the best pics infantrymen 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.770
 get this gives but you can so 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.259
 but does not play on it because it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 nothing is special for that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 Election infantry we have many 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.479
 cheap units little with animal animals 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 but pretty good 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.799
 elite units a single the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.240
 evening show up now here in the moon 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.729
 everything is against fear and fear 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.320
 very convenient and here too the whole 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.549
 units from the shepherds have these 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.229
 both skills are neat 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.850
 and I would say that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.750
 Let's put the moral on it as momentary 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.880
 to one of the most important things 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 ever and select jako of course 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.990
 properly support and thus for 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.509
 the whole thing a bit scary 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.860
 sight give quasi sat still 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.090
 bit ax infantry with the one too 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.450
 By the way, all these skills are available 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 this ability now time we watch 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.119
 Could the applicants take we could 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 the viking raiders the racks 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.950
 climate change but people we take them 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.450
 the nordic extra for the cost 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.099
 Of course, but less, of course, have the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.370
 biggest weapon damage scaffold best 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.110
 Attack of 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.720
 almost nothing is very good 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.640
 is traced definitely third-best 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470
 okay you have good melee attack but 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.370
 the best melee fan and that is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.650
 Now for us very important because we 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 need armor break it at the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.700
 cavalry looking now new items 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.970
 after that we only have four here 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.989
 units japan light ok and have 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.390
 a little here of the units 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.819
 Good hall unity with all units 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.079
 really scary you could be awesome 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.920
 it did not lock that's the only one 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.650
 that it stands out 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.579
 At first it really only we but 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.099
 take us for the nordic 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.780
 riding champion with because they are quite good 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.840
 if stats i could use well 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.040
 we see they are not bad 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.569
 and the playboy cover is not like that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.670
 just the best of us but clearly 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.159
 better than compared to other so 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.750
 we actually had there to do that 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:01.030
 we can also shoot and move 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 terror their excellent ability halt 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.900
 you do not lose any speed in the forest 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.700
 is quite practical but we people 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.670
 now want the archers here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.440
 with a total of five nordic warriors 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.760
 bow warrior because we have something with 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.700
 the morality we have up to now 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.200
 But as ten and 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.269
 splatter so much money left where does that come from 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.829
 put money back later 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.500
 even investing would be pretty handy 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.160
 or in the max warrior we always have 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.569
 exchange through berserk people that 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.769
 is still horny or defensive very mind 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.169
 cool is something fine 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.910
 something fine for the fine and the people 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.349
 hornets right on but we have to 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.819
 always take care that ours can do better 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.680
 which are being attacked by the camera 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.169
 which is very important and very strong like that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.290
 that a small problem gets that 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.489
 You also go if you really only want 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.410
 and that is just the tasks in the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.760
 play as a human being and the strength 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.319
 but push a bit more experience 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.430
 that's what it was with the army myself 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.099
 must say to us even now 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.810
 army and let's get rid of you link 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.690
 Roman empire's opponent but it is 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.069
 always so musicfest the opponent and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.379
 many times our re with never put 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.239
 look up and have a look 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.859
 good play also skin neat 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.340
 rhyming infantry is real 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.359
 not bad 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.790
 So let's see if it 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.470
 so does our line infantry 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.299
 sets Merzien the chosen warrior 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.250
 which are really cool in itself 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.500
 Fear against everyone is something 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.199
 Horny was almost all our units 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.090
 do not have that ability badly 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.650
 Numero two sets our archers 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.460
 and we really do have many 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.419
 archers 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.889
 So really many five pieces and these 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.979
 Five pieces should stop the moral later 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.910
 with influence by signals shot 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:39.370
 extended shot shot to shot 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.870
 or even burning shot that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.440
 are all things that you need well 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.389
 can 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.770
 to break with the moral with 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.770
 signal shots come pretty good 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.240
 bring masses in panic with full protection 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.949
 We also have to have targeted units 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.699
 still suspend 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.900
 put our Nordic heavy fighter 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.970
 Of course we have to give them to the francs 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.940
 but keep close an infantry 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.780
 So do not be so quick so not so 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.630
 they need a long time to be at the 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.860
 infantry sees this is important people 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.199
 That is very important for the unit 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.520
 a bit too protected and 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.050
 Therefore, the works also directly 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.470
 I do not want to go too far 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.180
 send 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.070
 but we must also watch had 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.270
 he almost did not come when the shotgun 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.409
 will then be laid so the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.090
 really need to be protected well 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.889
 today pay attention when you are with them 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.940
 plays so stimulate the cavalry 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.440
 some may wonder now 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.699
 that was important to put into the flanks 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.650
 otherwise I always stood in the flanks 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.300
 the bands in here because you can say 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.550
 that the lock warriors over here the 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.020
 is able to cover two sword fights is 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.940
 a little sword fighter di to sa 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.740
 and the two do that with the two 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.479
 and the camera can hold these four here 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.550
 cover so we are protected from 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.250
 enemy attacks of our generation 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.050
 as a reserve in the second row can 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.550
 you say that is maybe live with 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.750
 doing an extreme is pretty 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.810
 but then practically known 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.969
 but support my tactics well 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.680
 infantry before definitely infantry before 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.030
 in the fight a berserker in the 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.070
 bring in the flanks neatly 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.150
 terror must make the difficult fight 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.979
 The plants especially protect the plants 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.210
 said must be protected impression each time 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.680
 you can appreciate the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.039
 infantry chargers and later the 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.300
 move 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.250
 The archers should be the moral 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.900
 weaken and it's all about the moral 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.060
 people here that's a pure moral of 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.560
 with bacon simply cut just depends 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.060
 what the stuff holds and must really 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.440
 try to break the moral 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.210
 Well today I have you got the video 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.409
 Please write me your opinion and 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.570
 Excitations purely because I can unfortunately 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.190
 No thoughts why I read that 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.630
 like to see the comments also from the boss 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.979

 gorgeous where i am pretty much about it 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.030
 happy then I can also with
