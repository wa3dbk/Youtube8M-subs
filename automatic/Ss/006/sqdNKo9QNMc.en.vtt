00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
this is what it looks like closed and

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.770 
this is what it looks like closed and
let<00:00:38.969> me<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.180> open<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so opens up like so and it automatically

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.819 
so opens up like so and it automatically
wakes<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> iPad<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.469> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
wakes up the iPad and this is the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.410 
wakes up the iPad and this is the
negative<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> bad<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.300> out

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
negative I want to get the bad thing out

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.400 
negative I want to get the bad thing out
the<00:00:48.539> way<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.289> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the way first and then we can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.900 
the way first and then we can
concentrate<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.489> points

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
concentrate on all of the good points

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
concentrate on all of the good points
this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> angle<00:00:52.500> you're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.039> have

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this is the angle you're going to have

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
this is the angle you're going to have
the<00:00:53.280> screen<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:55.079> won't<00:00:55.379> Bend<00:00:55.920> any<00:00:56.100> more

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the screen at it won't Bend any more

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
the screen at it won't Bend any more
than<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> hinge<00:00:57.210> restricts<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
than that the hinge restricts the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
than that the hinge restricts the
movement<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.250> sort<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.550> angle<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
movement to this sort of angle so I can

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.320 
movement to this sort of angle so I can
no<00:01:00.930> longer<00:01:01.289> hold<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.520> iPad<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.719> an<00:01:03.960> iPad<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
no longer hold my iPad like an iPad I

no longer hold my iPad like an iPad I
can't<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.140> lost<00:01:07.530> its<00:01:07.799> tablet

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
can't do it it's lost its tablet

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.179 
can't do it it's lost its tablet
functionality<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.750> by<00:01:09.930> putting<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.500> iPad<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
functionality so by putting my iPad in

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
functionality so by putting my iPad in
the<00:01:11.369> Zagg<00:01:11.549> Keys<00:01:11.580> folio<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.570> now<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> mini<00:01:13.710> laptop

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the Zagg Keys folio is now a mini laptop

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460 
the Zagg Keys folio is now a mini laptop
I<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.700> no<00:01:15.060> longer<00:01:15.090> hold<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.930> use<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.140> like

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
I can no longer hold it and use it like

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.740 
I can no longer hold it and use it like
a<00:01:16.530> tablet<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.670> they'd<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.180> done<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> hinge

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
a tablet if they'd have done the hinge

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
a tablet if they'd have done the hinge
very<00:01:19.500> slightly<00:01:19.890> differently<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
very slightly differently so they have

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.510 
very slightly differently so they have
folded<00:01:21.270> all<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.020> itself<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
folded all the way back on itself or so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.670 
folded all the way back on itself or so
that<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> detached<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.439> would<00:01:25.650> have

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that it detached then this would have

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
that it detached then this would have
been<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.390> superb<00:01:27.390> product<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.619> an

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
excellent product it would have been

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.370

bits<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.140> pieces<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.560> we've<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> button

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
bits and pieces here we've got a button

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.980 
bits and pieces here we've got a button
here<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> push<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.840> actually

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
here which we can push and it actually

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.499 
here which we can push and it actually
gives<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> some<00:01:58.530> LED<00:01:59.280> sort<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.909> feedback<00:02:00.360> as

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
gives you some LED sort of feedback as

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.690 
gives you some LED sort of feedback as
to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> battery<00:02:01.200> status<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.250> keyboard

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
to the battery status of the keyboard

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
to the battery status of the keyboard
and<00:02:03.060> then<00:02:03.479> we've<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:03.750> got<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> backlight<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and then we've also got a backlight so

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
and then we've also got a backlight so
we<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.950> tap<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.210> backlight<00:02:06.600> comes

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
we can tap this and the backlight comes

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.889 
we can tap this and the backlight comes
on<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:08.009> we've<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.580> got<00:02:08.840> sort<00:02:09.840> of

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
on and then we've also got sort of

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
on and then we've also got sort of
different<00:02:10.200> levels<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> intensity<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
different levels of intensity to that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.370 
different levels of intensity to that
backlight<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.360> cycles<00:02:12.810> through

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
backlight so it cycles through

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460 
backlight so it cycles through
low<00:02:13.560> medium<00:02:14.220> high<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.270> off<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:16.170> nice

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
low medium high and then off so nice

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.170 
low medium high and then off so nice
that<00:02:16.740> we<00:02:16.800> got<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.950> backlight<00:02:17.460> in<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.000> well

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that we got a backlight in here as well

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.440 
that we got a backlight in here as well
and<00:02:19.040> overall<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> nice<00:02:20.580> typing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and overall it is a nice typing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.650 
and overall it is a nice typing
experience<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:22.230> fact<00:02:22.620> if<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> go<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:24.480> and

experience in fact if I go into here and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.270 
experience in fact if I go into here and
we're<00:02:25.410> launch<00:02:26.480> let's<00:02:27.480> launch<00:02:27.750> pages<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.560> then

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
we're launch let's launch pages and then

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.670 
we're launch let's launch pages and then
we<00:02:29.460> go<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.790> blank<00:02:30.030> document<00:02:30.350> let's<00:02:31.350> tap<00:02:31.560> on

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
we go to a blank document let's tap on

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.310 
we go to a blank document let's tap on
that<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.490> then<00:02:33.090> typing<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.930> very

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that one there and then typing is very

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.120 
that one there and then typing is very
very<00:02:34.650> good

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
very good

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.550 
very good
so<00:02:35.520> let<00:02:35.910> me<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.120> stretch<00:02:36.510> around<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.960> camera

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
so let me just stretch around the camera

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.820 
so let me just stretch around the camera
here<00:02:37.970> hello<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.580> test<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.830> Zagg

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
here hello this is a test of the Zagg

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.220 
here hello this is a test of the Zagg
Keys<00:02:45.620> folio<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:48.870> go

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
Keys folio there we go

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.650 
Keys folio there we go
so<00:02:49.470> no<00:02:49.710> typing<00:02:50.130> mistakes<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.030> tiny<00:02:51.390> bit

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
so no typing mistakes it is tiny bit

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.240 
so no typing mistakes it is tiny bit
smaller<00:02:51.960> than<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> keyboard<00:02:52.800> I'm<00:02:52.920> used<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
smaller than the keyboard I'm used to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.580 
smaller than the keyboard I'm used to
but<00:02:53.820> they're<00:02:54.000> nicely<00:02:54.540> spaced<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.260> works

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
but they're nicely spaced so it works

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.310 
but they're nicely spaced so it works
extremely<00:02:55.920> well<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.870> we've<00:02:57.990> got<00:02:58.110> sort

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
extremely well and then we've got sort

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.990 
extremely well and then we've got sort
of<00:02:58.380> shortcut<00:02:58.800> keys<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.250> bottom<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.850> so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
of shortcut keys at the bottom here so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.790 
of shortcut keys at the bottom here so
we<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.750> fact<00:03:00.780> or<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.350> invoke<00:03:01.590> the

we can in fact or we invoke the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.370 
we can in fact or we invoke the
on-screen<00:03:02.280> keyboard<00:03:02.490> we<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.300> also<00:03:03.540> go<00:03:04.350> back

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
on-screen keyboard we can also go back

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.500 
on-screen keyboard we can also go back
to<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.860> home<00:03:05.040> screen<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.150> works

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
to the home screen and it just works

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.630

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.770 
millimeter audio jack round on the
bottom<00:03:43.800> we've<00:03:44.340> got<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.490> cutout<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:45.270> the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
bottom we've got a cutout for the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.840 
bottom we've got a cutout for the
Lightning<00:03:46.320> connector<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.040> then<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.520> here

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
Lightning connector and then just here

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.890 
Lightning connector and then just here
these<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.490> on/off<00:03:50.490> button<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.480> this

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
these are the on/off button I think this

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.600 
these are the on/off button I think this
is<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.140> bluetooth<00:03:52.530> pairing<00:03:52.830> button<00:03:53.160> just

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
is the bluetooth pairing button just

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.790 
is the bluetooth pairing button just
here<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.660> we've<00:03:54.780> also<00:03:54.870> got<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> micro<00:03:55.770> USB

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
here and then we've also got a micro USB

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.300 
here and then we've also got a micro USB
connector<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:57.090> charge<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.720> keyboard<00:03:58.260> on<00:03:58.470> this

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
connector to charge the keyboard on this

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.280 
connector to charge the keyboard on this
because<00:03:59.520> you<00:03:59.640> have<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.880> keep<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.180> charged<00:04:00.690> now

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
because you have to keep it charged now

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.520 
because you have to keep it charged now
this<00:04:02.040> is<00:04:02.220> very<00:04:02.430> well<00:04:02.640> laid<00:04:02.910> out<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.360> do<00:04:03.570> like<00:04:04.170> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
this is very well laid out I do like the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.000 
this is very well laid out I do like the
way<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.920> this<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.190> such<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.459> slim<00:04:05.940> profile

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
way that this is such a slim profile

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.410 
way that this is such a slim profile
this<00:04:08.010> has<00:04:08.130> got<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> nice<00:04:08.490> texture<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.240> as

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this has got a nice texture to it as

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.800 
this has got a nice texture to it as
well

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
well

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.980 
well
very<00:04:10.230> very<00:04:10.500> nice<00:04:10.770> texture<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:12.090> case<00:04:12.300> we've

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
very very nice texture to the case we've

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.570 
very very nice texture to the case we've
also<00:04:13.170> got<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.070> sort<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
also got this this is sort of a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.490 
also got this this is sort of a
reminiscent<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.600> what<00:04:15.750> you'd<00:04:15.870> find<00:04:16.140> on<00:04:16.320> an

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
reminiscent of what you'd find on an

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.740 
reminiscent of what you'd find on an
Apple<00:04:17.130> laptop<00:04:17.270> we've<00:04:18.270> got<00:04:18.390> this<00:04:18.480> sort<00:04:18.660> of

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
Apple laptop we've got this sort of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.020 
Apple laptop we've got this sort of
cutout<00:04:19.200> bit<00:04:19.440> here<00:04:19.830> which<00:04:20.310> helps<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.850> when

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
cutout bit here which helps you when

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.150 
cutout bit here which helps you when
you're<00:04:21.090> actually<00:04:21.540> opening<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:22.109> up<00:04:22.200> like<00:04:22.979> this

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
you're actually opening it up like this

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.370 
you're actually opening it up like this
and<00:04:23.430> as<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.580> say<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.820> has<00:04:23.940> got<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.180> auto<00:04:24.450> wake

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
and as I say it has got that auto wake

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.600 
and as I say it has got that auto wake
feature<00:04:25.710> on<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.070> as<00:04:26.160> well

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
feature on it as well

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.969 
feature on it as well
let<00:04:27.509> me<00:04:27.569> show<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.810> as<00:04:28.020> well<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.530> little

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
let me show you as well a little

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.790 
let me show you as well a little
close-up<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:30.539> backlight<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.319> this<00:04:31.680> is

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
close-up of the backlight so this is

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.950 
close-up of the backlight so this is
obviously<00:04:31.949> with<00:04:32.310> no<00:04:32.520> backlight<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.419> then

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
obviously with no backlight on and then

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.070 
obviously with no backlight on and then
we've<00:04:34.289> got<00:04:34.409> the<00:04:34.620> low<00:04:35.039> setting<00:04:35.310> medium<00:04:36.300> high

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
we've got the low setting medium high

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.950 
we've got the low setting medium high
and<00:04:37.409> then<00:04:38.039> off<00:04:38.250> again<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.000> very<00:04:39.389> even

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and then off again so very even

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.689 
and then off again so very even
backlighting<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> this<00:04:40.860> as<00:04:41.039> well<00:04:41.159> it<00:04:41.370> really

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
backlighting to this as well it really

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.209 
backlighting to this as well it really
does<00:04:42.030> help<00:04:42.300> when<00:04:42.930> you're<00:04:43.110> working<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.800> sort<00:04:44.159> of

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
does help when you're working in sort of

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.719 
does help when you're working in sort of
dark<00:04:44.550> or<00:04:44.909> sort<00:04:45.509> of<00:04:45.539> low<00:04:45.750> light<00:04:45.990> situations<00:04:46.800> so

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
dark or sort of low light situations so

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.659 
dark or sort of low light situations so
overall<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.509> nice<00:04:49.050> keyboard<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
overall this is a nice keyboard and the

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.249 
overall this is a nice keyboard and the
nice<00:04:50.819> case<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.270> offers<00:04:51.479> up<00:04:51.599> a<00:04:51.689> nice<00:04:51.870> amount<00:04:52.110> of

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
nice case it offers up a nice amount of

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.619 
nice case it offers up a nice amount of
protection<00:04:52.409> I<00:04:53.210> showed<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.389> at<00:04:54.449> the<00:04:54.479> beginning

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
protection I showed you at the beginning

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:57.860 
protection I showed you at the beginning
of<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:54.960> video<00:04:55.319> but<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:55.979> didn't<00:04:56.250> like<00:04:56.460> what<00:04:57.270> why

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
of this video but I didn't like what why

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.689 
of this video but I didn't like what why
the<00:04:57.930> hinge<00:04:58.319> didn't<00:04:58.770> go<00:04:58.860> all<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.069> way<00:04:59.129> back<00:04:59.430> I

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
the hinge didn't go all the way back I

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.360 
the hinge didn't go all the way back I
can<00:05:00.360> see<00:05:00.750> why<00:05:00.960> they've<00:05:01.169> done<00:05:01.349> it<00:05:01.530> because<00:05:01.770> when

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
can see why they've done it because when

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.339 
can see why they've done it because when
it's<00:05:02.490> in<00:05:02.669> in<00:05:02.940> sort<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.389> this<00:05:03.509> mode<00:05:03.810> let<00:05:04.139> me<00:05:04.199> just

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
it's in in sort of this mode let me just

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.020 
it's in in sort of this mode let me just
move<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.740> out<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.009> way<00:05:05.159> when<00:05:05.729> it's<00:05:05.879> sort

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
move that out of the way when it's sort

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.969 
move that out of the way when it's sort
of<00:05:06.090> laid<00:05:06.569> back<00:05:06.810> like<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.319> at<00:05:07.500> least<00:05:07.770> it

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
of laid back like this at least it

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.010 
of laid back like this at least it
doesn't<00:05:08.310> go<00:05:08.550> back<00:05:08.759> any<00:05:08.909> further<00:05:09.150> so<00:05:09.539> itself

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
doesn't go back any further so itself

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.619 
doesn't go back any further so itself
supports<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:11.490> weight<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.300> screen

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
supports the weight of the screen

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.689 
supports the weight of the screen
without<00:05:12.840> any<00:05:12.990> need<00:05:13.440> for<00:05:13.500> any<00:05:14.039> sort<00:05:14.639> of

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
without any need for any sort of

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.520 
without any need for any sort of
additional<00:05:14.909> kickstand<00:05:15.599> so<00:05:15.719> I<00:05:15.810> can<00:05:15.930> understand

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
additional kickstand so I can understand

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.920 
additional kickstand so I can understand
why<00:05:16.710> they've<00:05:16.860> done<00:05:17.009> it<00:05:17.219> I<00:05:17.849> just<00:05:18.180> wish<00:05:18.569> they'd

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
why they've done it I just wish they'd

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.749 
why they've done it I just wish they'd
done<00:05:19.650> something<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.069> little<00:05:20.250> bit<00:05:20.370> different

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
done something a little bit different

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.510 
done something a little bit different
but<00:05:21.330> overall<00:05:21.900> what<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.139> really<00:05:22.650> do<00:05:22.770> like<00:05:23.009> this<00:05:23.250> I

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
but overall what I really do like this I

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.459 
but overall what I really do like this I
think<00:05:23.879> the<00:05:24.150> highlight<00:05:24.360> feature<00:05:24.840> for<00:05:25.139> me<00:05:25.259> is

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
think the highlight feature for me is

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
purchased as a tablet so that's not a

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.089 
purchased as a tablet so that's not a
deal-breaker<00:05:48.330> for<00:05:48.719> me<00:05:48.990> but<00:05:49.409> it<00:05:49.560> is<00:05:49.589> a<00:05:49.710> shame

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.559 
deal-breaker for me but it is a shame
that<00:05:50.159> they<00:05:50.490> didn't<00:05:50.789> sort<00:05:50.969> do<00:05:51.150> a<00:05:51.180> little<00:05:51.449> bit

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
that they didn't sort do a little bit

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.110 
that they didn't sort do a little bit
