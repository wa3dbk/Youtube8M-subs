00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the flavor of the dish chilli turmeric

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.780 
the flavor of the dish chilli turmeric
in<00:00:32.700> most<00:00:33.630> vegetarian<00:00:34.260> dishes<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.579> end

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
in most vegetarian dishes and at the end

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.220 
in most vegetarian dishes and at the end
there's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> garnish<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> way<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
there's a garnish in the way that you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.709 
there's a garnish in the way that you
would<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.430> parsley<00:00:38.450> we're<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> use

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
would use parsley we're going to use

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
would use parsley we're going to use
curry<00:00:39.930> masala<00:00:40.320> today<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.149> oil<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.540> hot<00:00:42.750> too

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
curry masala today so the oil is hot too

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
curry masala today so the oil is hot too
we<00:00:43.110> always<00:00:43.320> start<00:00:43.829> by<00:00:44.030> crackling<00:00:45.030> love<00:00:45.210> spices

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
we always start by crackling love spices

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.270 
we always start by crackling love spices
because<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> releases<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.739> aromatic<00:00:47.100> oils

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because that releases the aromatic oils

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
because that releases the aromatic oils
within<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> spices<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> true

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
within the spices and we get a true

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.880 
within the spices and we get a true
flavor<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.879> deer<00:00:51.600> our<00:00:51.780> seeds<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
flavor so the deer our seeds go in and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.470 
flavor so the deer our seeds go in and
they<00:00:52.949> frenzy<00:00:53.370> around<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.360> they

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
they frenzy around and they do as they

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.900 
they frenzy around and they do as they
should<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.050> once<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.860> go<00:00:56.039> Brown<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.640> throw

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
should and once they go Brown we throw

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:19.270 
should and once they go Brown we throw
in<00:00:57.090> our

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.520 

release<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.880> but<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.360> front<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.780> transforms

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
release it but the front that transforms

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.100 
release it but the front that transforms
