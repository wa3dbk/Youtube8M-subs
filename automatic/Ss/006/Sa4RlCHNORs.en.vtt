00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this it was one maneuver if it was one

this it was one maneuver if it was one
big<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:04.860> right<00:02:04.980> here<00:02:05.190> throws<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> tail<00:02:05.970> out

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
big one right here throws the tail out

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.290 
big one right here throws the tail out
rides<00:02:08.040> it<00:02:08.190> backwards<00:02:08.640> spins<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.240> around

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
rides it backwards spins it around

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.280 
rides it backwards spins it around
cleanly

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290

still<00:02:12.950> generating<00:02:13.459> speed<00:02:13.640> looking<00:02:13.970> for<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150

still generating speed looking for a
forehand<00:02:14.510> err<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> got<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.080> feeling<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.590> that's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
forehand err I got a feeling and that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.630 
forehand err I got a feeling and that's
exactly<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.280> he<00:02:16.340> goes<00:02:16.519> into<00:02:16.849> right

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
exactly what he goes into right
