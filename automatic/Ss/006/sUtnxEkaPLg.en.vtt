00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.300
 own home 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.610
 to the Brazilian who does not want to have a corner challenge in many already 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.640
 only in the first quarter of this year 55 thousand 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.420
 villas across the country compared financed nearly five and a half million 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:27.120
 of real is 81.85% higher than in the same period of last year but still has 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.119
 lots of people looking for options 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.080
 air 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.580
 lack of housing for the population in the range of up to five minimum wages 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.739
 practically coitus million families do not want the home to own 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.740
 and more than 12 million rent 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.730
 when people duly registered but will not be missing is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.330
 remember is the wedding dress 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.350
 the couple needs to know where they live 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 and that is where a dilemma arises peace marcondes plucked apartment 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.140
 or own house share 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.790
 the error roseana we have been together for a year and a half I understand then they pay rent 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.250
 do they want to keep this expense for a long time 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.800
 paid gestation rent if the exchange rate 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.600
 money through the window 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.570
 so has not appeared yet 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.950
 because, even because the grandchildren are still installing real estate with less 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.670
 We bought exactly for this apartment. 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.400
 but after a while you want to change things in the apartment you want 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.170
 do with the stab you want to customize 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.119
 want to do a eu analysis but we can not invest in anything because 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.110
 otherwise our goal was fashion 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.070
 for rent 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.280
 maybe for a year or two 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.100
 and in that period began to search and look for the property to live in 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 final 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 this time has come 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.830
 I saw luciana are already in the research phase and look forward to buying 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
 apartment 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.780
 and the moment is good in the last three months there has been a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.539
 of real estate credit in Brazil 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.009
 the interest rates can be identified they were in the range of 12% up to four 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.769
 years ago 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.860
 you can find rates of 7% 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.749
 nearly half 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.130
 in other stages it is currently 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.370
 went from 15 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.019
 for 30 years 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.179
 the consequence 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:33.449
 the installment falls pretty much fits in the buyer's pocket there is not a boom 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.650
 real estate with many prisoners I usually say 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.969
 but a vigorous growth 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.889
 and the companies are prepared are planning to meet this 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:44.989
 growth 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.920
 is the best way possible then anyone thinking of acquiring a 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.169
 property to bet the deadline 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.509
 it is recommended that you start this research effectively, I think that 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 find good deals right now 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.360
 in 2008 I like the house itself 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 was when new rules began to apply to those who receive less interest paid 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.790
 smaller ones and those who receive more can use the guarantee fund there are several 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.370
 ways to make dream come true with private banks or 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.830
 direct financing with the developer the letter of credit and with the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.000
 partner is another possibility that must be considered because it is very 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.139
 is to save 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.769
 knowing all the ways is essential to know in detail the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.719
 stages of a process that will be part of finances for the rest of your life 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.909
 What is responsible buying within the real estate market? 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.389
 the buyer 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.369
 certainly with patience without rushing 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.219
 and what to do a check 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.219
 both in the construction and in the hillside development 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.619
 Eugenio Sequeira have learned the lesson now he prepares for the 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:05.549
 next step of the season own house 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.409
 with the release in the second report of the series that you will follow the 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.199
 case and to do the accounts to finance the property until
