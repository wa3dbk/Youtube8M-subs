you know Steve Jobs is he's insane about
these<00:03:48.470> things<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:49.010> yeah<00:03:49.430> that's<00:03:49.699> gone<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:50.389> you

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
these things so yeah that's gone so you

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.640 
these things so yeah that's gone so you
get<00:03:50.599> that<00:03:50.750> instead<00:03:51.169> at<00:03:51.319> least<00:03:51.470> it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
get that instead at least it's

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.990 
get that instead at least it's
consistent<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.280> guess<00:03:52.430> which<00:03:52.609> is<00:03:52.760> what<00:03:52.910> he

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
and that is fantastic because when I'm

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.229 
and that is fantastic because when I'm
reading<00:04:10.099> in<00:04:10.310> my<00:04:10.400> bed<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:10.790> stuff<00:04:10.940> reading

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
reading in my bed and stuff reading

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.210 
reading in my bed and stuff reading
comics<00:04:11.569> or<00:04:11.659> whatever<00:04:11.870> I'll<00:04:12.799> turn<00:04:13.040> off<00:04:13.099> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
comics or whatever I'll turn off the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.559 
comics or whatever I'll turn off the
lamp<00:04:13.400> sometimes<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.970> you<00:04:14.000> normally<00:04:14.269> had<00:04:14.389> to

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
lamp sometimes and you normally had to

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.960 
lamp sometimes and you normally had to
sort<00:04:15.139> of<00:04:15.199> go<00:04:15.349> into<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.620> settings<00:04:15.889> app<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.579> it

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
sort of go into the settings app and it

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.449 
sort of go into the settings app and it
would<00:04:17.150> default<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:18.709> so<00:04:18.979> you'd<00:04:19.130> have<00:04:19.159> to

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
would default to this so you'd have to

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.640 
would default to this so you'd have to
go<00:04:19.639> up<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.299> brightness<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.989> wallpaper<00:04:21.409> and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
go up to brightness and wallpaper and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.080 
go up to brightness and wallpaper and
then<00:04:21.739> make<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.190> brightness<00:04:22.550> slide<00:04:22.789> up<00:04:22.969> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
then make the brightness slide up and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.159 
then make the brightness slide up and
down<00:04:23.210> and<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.630> don't<00:04:23.810> like<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.050> auto

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
down and I don't like the auto

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.440 
down and I don't like the auto
brightness<00:04:24.409> and<00:04:24.740> if<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:24.919> works<00:04:25.099> probably

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
brightness and if it works probably

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.110 
brightness and if it works probably
for<00:04:25.570> me<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.170> do<00:04:26.290> it<00:04:26.500> manually<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.520> now<00:04:27.670> you

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
for me so I do it manually but now you

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.920 
for me so I do it manually but now you
don't<00:04:28.300> have<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.540> go<00:04:28.660> through<00:04:28.810> all<00:04:28.870> that

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
don't have to go through all that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.970 
don't have to go through all that
rigmarole<00:04:29.170> every<00:04:29.470> time<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.650> want<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.800> change

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
rigmarole every time you want to change

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.740 
rigmarole every time you want to change
the<00:04:30.070> brightness<00:04:30.160> you<00:04:30.460> go<00:04:30.550> tap<00:04:30.760> tap<00:04:31.030> swipe

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
the brightness you go tap tap swipe
