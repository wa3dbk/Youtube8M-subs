would we communicate that's exactly
right<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.690> have<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.810> message<00:03:27.050> in<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.410> bottle

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
right if you have a message in a bottle

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.620 
right if you have a message in a bottle
in<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> ocean<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.610> can't<00:03:28.820> communicate<00:03:29.060> back

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
in the ocean you can't communicate back

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.240 
in the ocean you can't communicate back
to<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.960> people<00:03:30.080> send<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.680> message<00:03:31.010> in<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.220> bottle

to the people send a message in a bottle

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.760 
to the people send a message in a bottle
right<00:03:31.970> which<00:03:32.540> makes<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:32.930> see<00:03:33.200> what<00:03:33.410> kind<00:03:33.650> of

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
right which makes you see what kind of

right which makes you see what kind of
kind<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.280> strange<00:03:34.550> good<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:35.210> understand<00:03:35.600> up

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
kind of strange good I can understand up

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.050 
kind of strange good I can understand up
you<00:03:35.960> came<00:03:36.200> up<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.620> idea<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:37.310> got<00:03:37.880> under

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
you came up with the idea I got under

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.480 
you came up with the idea I got under
said<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.420> NASA<00:03:38.750> came<00:03:39.200> up<00:03:39.350> with<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.590> idea<00:03:39.680> and

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
said of NASA came up with the idea and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.460 
said of NASA came up with the idea and
what<00:03:40.640> about<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:41.000> United<00:03:41.360> Nations<00:03:41.480> I<00:03:41.960> think

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
what about the United Nations I think

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.380 
what about the United Nations I think
they<00:03:42.560> want<00:03:42.710> to<00:03:42.800> stake<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:42.980> claim<00:03:43.190> because<00:03:43.850> right

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
they want to stake a claim because right

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.690 
they want to stake a claim because right
now<00:03:44.420> there<00:03:44.810> are<00:03:44.840> no<00:03:45.140> protocols<00:03:45.430> there's<00:03:46.430> no

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
now there are no protocols there's no

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.850 
now there are no protocols there's no
way<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.420> address<00:03:47.960> an<00:03:48.200> alien<00:03:48.710> ambassador

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
way to address an alien ambassador

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.520 
way to address an alien ambassador
there's<00:03:49.640> no<00:03:49.790> way<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> set<00:03:50.360> up<00:03:50.510> how<00:03:50.870> trade<00:03:51.320> would

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
there's no way to set up how trade would

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.410 
there's no way to set up how trade would
be<00:03:51.710> quite<00:03:51.980> communications<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.060> information

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
be quite communications and information

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.420 
be quite communications and information
will<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:53.960> exchanged<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:54.830> I<00:03:54.860> think<00:03:54.980> they<00:03:55.220> want

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
will be exchanged so I think they want

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.280 
will be exchanged so I think they want
to<00:03:55.490> like<00:03:55.610> put<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.820> stake<00:03:56.150> in<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:56.960> ground

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
to like put a stake in the in the ground

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.710 
to like put a stake in the in the ground
and<00:03:57.500> say<00:03:57.740> we<00:03:58.220> claim<00:03:58.520> this<00:03:58.550> in<00:03:59.240> the<00:03:59.360> name<00:03:59.480> of<00:03:59.540> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
and say we claim this in the name of the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.060 
and say we claim this in the name of the
United<00:04:00.020> Nation<00:04:00.350> now<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.560> know<00:04:00.740> there<00:04:01.040> are

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
United Nation now I know there are

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.070 
United Nation now I know there are
others<00:04:01.400> who<00:04:01.610> believe<00:04:01.640> in<00:04:02.300> life<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.930> outer

already<00:04:06.620> mm-hmm<00:04:07.310> but<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.940> point<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.330> you

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
already mm-hmm but the point that you

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.270 
already mm-hmm but the point that you
make<00:04:08.690> about<00:04:08.900> these<00:04:09.260> satellites<00:04:09.860> in<00:04:10.190> the

make about these satellites in the
coming<00:04:10.580> year<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.940> Kepler<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
coming year the Kepler and is it the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.620 
coming year the Kepler and is it the
karateka<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:12.920> silent<00:04:13.400> freakin<00:04:13.760> deep<00:04:14.120> into

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
karateka a silent freakin deep into

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.600 
karateka a silent freakin deep into
space<00:04:14.750> right<00:04:15.140> right<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:15.830> might<00:04:16.100> be<00:04:16.310> able<00:04:16.430> to

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
space right right they might be able to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.940 
space right right they might be able to
find<00:04:16.850> signs<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.480> life<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:18.380> right<00:04:18.530> but<00:04:18.830> the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
find signs of life that's right but the

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.250 
find signs of life that's right but the
signs<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.430> life<00:04:19.610> would<00:04:19.820> be<00:04:19.940> like<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.690> microbes

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260

right<00:04:21.530> well<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.100> believe<00:04:22.550> she<00:04:22.730> is<00:04:22.850> walking

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
right well I believe she is walking

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.410 
right well I believe she is walking
around<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.720> now<00:04:23.870> some<00:04:24.590> part<00:04:24.770> we<00:04:24.860> have<00:04:24.980> found
