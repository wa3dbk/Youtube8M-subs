carbons<00:00:20.279> front<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.090> back<00:00:21.300> carbon<00:00:21.660> fiber<00:00:21.960> skin

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
carbons front and back carbon fiber skin

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.429 
carbons front and back carbon fiber skin
for<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> ipad<00:00:22.980> 2<00:00:23.310> &amp;<00:00:23.640> 3<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.050> called<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
for the ipad 2 &amp; 3 so it's called the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
for the ipad 2 &amp; 3 so it's called the
ipad<00:00:25.470> second<00:00:26.130> generation<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.240> new<00:00:27.390> ipad

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
ipad second generation and the new ipad

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
ipad second generation and the new ipad
so<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.769> work<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.340> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
so this is going to work for that and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950 
so this is going to work for that and
it's<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> give<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> real<00:00:30.300> nice<00:00:30.539> carbon

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it's going to give it a real nice carbon

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
it's going to give it a real nice carbon
fiber<00:00:31.170> look<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.710> yeah<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.910> let's<00:00:33.090> go<00:00:33.180> check<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
fiber look and yeah so let's go check it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
fiber look and yeah so let's go check it
out<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.320> skin<00:00:34.530> itself<00:00:34.829> provides<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.399> real

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
out so the skin itself provides a real

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
out so the skin itself provides a real
nice<00:00:35.820> carbon<00:00:36.300> fiber<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
nice carbon fiber look when you have it

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.650 
nice carbon fiber look when you have it
in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> light<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.850> gives<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.300> nice

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
in the light it really gives that a nice

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
in the light it really gives that a nice
look<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:41.399> only<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> good

has land the table design so even though

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.299 
has land the table design so even though
it's<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.270> skinny<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.899> practically<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.070> even
