00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.629
 touch-up tutorial with photoshop today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.490
 let's touch up a classic portrait of the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.220
 girl that you see on the screen we are going to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.650
 give a point in black and white and we will 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.780
 see all that is the subject of levels and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.460
 we'll end up giving some grain to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.920
 end of the image 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.580
 first we are going to open it with adobe 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.040
 raw camera 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.040
 let's put a neutral profile 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.009
 then let's play with the 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.009
 medium tones 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 to give more strength to the photo 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.269
 the exposure is correct so no 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.089
 let's touch the white balance 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.280
 It would also be absurd because if you give 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.969
 tell the photo we will not pass it to 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.890
 black and white 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.050
 we could saturate the image from 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.460
 here 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 but we can also do today 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.730
 photoshop the effect is the same so 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.470
 in principle let's open the photo and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.860
 directly and once we have it 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.339
 open with photoshop let's do the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.740
 conversion 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.969
 let's go to saturation tone what 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.470
 we can saturate the image with the 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.890
 saturate command let's do 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.580
 from here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.770
 the effect is already very good in itself if the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 skin tone of the girl or the balance of 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.400
 whites would not have been the right one we 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.380
 could have been face with some 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960
 very gray tones then 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.540
 we can enter here in the red channel by 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.090
 example play with the brightness you see the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.369
 effect 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.060
 we can play with red and with 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.060
 yellow to get luminosity and 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.710
 where you need the picture so this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.240
 system is very good to go to white 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 and black now we make an ok 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.450
 let's see the levels to see how 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450
 is ready grass 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.930
 ok we see that it's pretty good 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.690
 balanced that we have information 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.010
 from blacks to whites although it is not 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.600
 It is necessary that you always reach the target 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.190
 because that would mean that it has 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.290
 burned skin 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.640
 so at first we wanted nothing more 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.640
 Now let's clean up the image first 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.120
 what is the background there behind 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.200
 girl with the patch let's remove the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.200
 sensor specks that you see 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.220
 In the case of a portrait, we are not going to 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.440
 give as much importance to retouching as if 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.410
 it was a beauty photo the challenge that 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.640
 obviously has its importance 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.590
 we mean that we are not going to make a 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.810
 frequency separation because 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.610
 girls and skin very well and the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.770
 imperfections that can be seen 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.080
 can be removed without having to resort to 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.220
 that system in principle with the patch 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.220
 we can remove some grain 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.240
 but what shadows are like this one 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.030
 the ojera or this small of the level here 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.720
 lights we will solve better 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.380
 the 2 amber that is to say let's use the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.380
 clarify tool 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.700
 the average levels 20% 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.830
 and we are going to give a few passes to clarify 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.820
 this zone 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.820
 and be here 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 a light to the chin 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.290
 and the corners of the lips 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.050
 we can even use a brush 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.900
 tiny 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.900
 we can give some light to the eyes 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.750
 we fixed some points where we were 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.750
 The view fails when we look at the photo 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.650
 if doing it with the patch you see that 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.090
 some edges appear then you can 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.090
 resort to the clone plug 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.350
 The face is not finished and it is like 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.870
 we want we can resort for 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.910
 try if you want to see it as it is 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.720
 would make the tool liquefy 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.720
 with this tool 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.219
 we could modify any aspect of 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.689
 the face if the girl had one eye 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:02.330
 off center one higher than the other 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.159
 a tad or have the analyze the best 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.210
 too wide everything can be touched on 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.400
 the case of the girls' factions 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.400
 they are perfect so there is no problem 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.520
 whatever you do you always have 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.110
 what to do with a lot of hand 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.430
 the accounts that is not the girl can not 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.849
 lose your identity no matter how much you 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.129
 challenge case and neither should be noted in the 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.599
 stroke of 6 as you see now 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.289
 this type of effects you have to 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.809
 avoid them knowing always 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.559
 where you have to where you have to do 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:37.539
 the anchor point to reduce or 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.260
 to extend any value of the face 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.950
 or the body 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.950
 we accept 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
 and then we are going to add something 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.260
 of grain so that it looks more 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.280
 classic 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.280
 duplicate layer 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.210
 that layer is filled in gray 50% 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.220
 we enter granulated texture filter 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.540
 we come to the extended type 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.540
 intensity 40 contrast 50 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.039
 This grain is in color and our photos 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:22.289
 in black and white so we'll go into 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.289
 saturate settings image 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.110
 and once it's black and white you 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.110
 We give a soft light fusion mode 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.120
 you see the effect if the grain were 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.850
 excessive for your taste 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.550
 you can reduce the intensity by lowering the 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:44.140
 opacity of the layer as already the last 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.140
 would be to attach the layer 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.360
 and save it and with that we would have the photo 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.360
 already finished
