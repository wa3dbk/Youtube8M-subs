00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi hi so after doing the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.179
 eyelashes we're going to do the eyebrows for 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.730
 this I'm unchecked this I created 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.900
 three curves for but today we 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 creates that of what actually 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.890
 to orient myself in relation to the woman 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.369
 that I'm doing is just enough to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.609
 select those but also to make a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.800
 live guy here now I have my 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 curves I can modify them if I want 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.140
 it will follow the mesh here is to say 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.930
 something a little bit a little bit less 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.489
 uniform after the principle it's going to be 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.430
 what are you going to be creating curves that 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 gave the shape of the eyebrows clack 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 clac clac clac and modify them 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.789
 actually for that to have some 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.890
 okay thing so what I'm going 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.700
 to do what I wanted is this in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 a calm corner 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.930
 so I 'm going to go in created is a pick 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:04.589
 up store and I 'm actually having fun at tickets 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 like that with the key and I'm fast 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.180
 eh it's just to show you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.180
 principle 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 that is all 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.890
 we're going the videos I've already done in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.480
 make the hair by the eyelashes so that's it 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.030
 once you have you see you have 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.310
 your curves and follow well the mesh 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.150
 we will press selected in on 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.000
 press x 9 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.200
 or rather not leaning on the leak we're going 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.330
 all selected we will make a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 robot bild 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.240
 so maybe dyed surface edit curve 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.130
 kearl scrap so there imminent journey 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 big failure at a miss at robin 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 so these are the courses in fact we premium or 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.509
 a slightly different form 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.509
 we do not hesitate to modify if necessary 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.729
 So here is my business 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.180
 we're going to uncheck the live guy and we 're going 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.369
 just have fun giving shape to 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.180
 our soft hairs a desk puts in his 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.020
 group so here with the key f9 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 to go faster 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.780
 So that's as simple as that 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.730
 do you do that on a number of games 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:32.220
 of hair to actually give the shape of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:34.920
 eyebrow that you desire you so a 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.810
 once we are satisfied, that is to say 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.450
 wise to remove green games poster is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:48.829
 the one I already did that played 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:54.299
 so hide there I sent my curves 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.519
 that I placed correctly to have 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.720
 my eyebrows 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.109
 so it did not take too much time 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.459
 had been relatively fast so a 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.739
 once we have done this it is enough 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.239
 now do com.com for eyelashes 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:13.319
 so we go in the dynamics we will do 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:17.959
 a sign to naked system seas voila voila 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.959
 I selected our system which is 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.910
 right here 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.569
 and we're going to maybe do it at Sint and Flash 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.140
 ball tower 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.360
 so here we go uncheck these 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.300
 will be easier and a match and you 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.550
 So here you see we have our 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.190
 curves a trick that I saw is that if 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.720
 never have lessons - pour into the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.700
 wrong sense we can change them by the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.739
 suite without problem so there you see 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.800
 if we leave it like that we have something 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.120
 of friendly already and we will play in 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:58.480
 done with signing with luiz club 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:03.810
 but push that's it and with the number of 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:07.180
 hair so what if we want hairy 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.920
 we're going to uncheck sell and posters 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.480
 and the curves 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 if we want polite seeing nasa then 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:20.320
 you've seen it's relatively 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:25.229
 friendly directly when one is 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:32.110
 anyway less we're going to change 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:33.220
 but I love to admit black so here 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.560
 right now we have something of a 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.080
 little more friendly when we have our 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.530
 hair we can again with the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.530
 settings 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.889
 here 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.330
 So here we have our sources 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.249
 relatively quickly to do that at 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:18.689
 do a little control of the dishes he goes 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:22.080
 not give me my control of powers 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.879
 and there we have our sources so I think 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.069
 that I joke to add curves here 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.919
 upstairs to have something a little less 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:31.499
 hungry but here it is relatively safe 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.749
 friendly from the start what games 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:35.749
 green will select files the hat 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:44.800
 here 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.330
 chat line 6 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.770
 here 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.509
 we have a hole there is far too much 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.250
 eyebrows and if he so he does very 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.360
 effeminate 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.569
 but it's funny here you go 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.569
 See you
