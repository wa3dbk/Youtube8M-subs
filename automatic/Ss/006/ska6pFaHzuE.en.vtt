a<00:02:00.170> rope<00:02:00.380> l2<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.700> analog<00:02:02.180> model<00:02:02.659> for<00:02:03.110> a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
a rope l2 this is the analog model for a

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.780 
a rope l2 this is the analog model for a
television<00:02:03.470> set<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.190> this<00:02:04.340> plugs<00:02:04.610> directly

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
television set so this plugs directly

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.660 
television set so this plugs directly
into<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.420> input<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.049> TV<00:02:06.350> set<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.460> have

this set up in the third mode this is

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.309 
this set up in the third mode this is
this<00:02:09.679> stage<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.850> view<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.720> stage<00:02:11.989> allows

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
this stage and view so the stage allows
