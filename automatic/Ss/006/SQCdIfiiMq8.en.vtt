00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.990 
well and a hard lock can be obtained
that<00:02:46.320> means<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.740> poses<00:02:46.950> well<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.850> can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that means it poses well and you can

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.930 
that means it poses well and you can
also<00:02:48.120> push<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.840> sharp<00:02:49.110> turn

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940
