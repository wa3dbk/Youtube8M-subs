so that you don't get bubbles in your
mind<00:04:59.380> if<00:04:59.500> I<00:05:08.099> rest<00:05:09.099> in<00:05:09.460> this<00:05:09.759> case<00:05:11.009> just<00:05:12.009> click

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
mind if I rest in this case just click

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.990 
mind if I rest in this case just click
