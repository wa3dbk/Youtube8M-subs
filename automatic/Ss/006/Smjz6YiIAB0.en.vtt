because<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> need<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.620> convert<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.190> um<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:45.629> RGB

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
because you need to convert it um to RGB

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.130 
because you need to convert it um to RGB
to<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.860> anything<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.690> simple

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to do anything with it and it's simple

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.560 
to do anything with it and it's simple
to<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.010> paint<00:00:50.570> background

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
to do it's just a paint background

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.310 
to do it's just a paint background
contents<00:00:52.350> keep<00:00:53.160> transparent<00:00:54.079> even<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.199> you're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
contents keep transparent even if you're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
contents keep transparent even if you're
not<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:55.890> transparency<00:00:56.780> use

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
not going to use transparency use

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
not going to use transparency use
transparent<00:00:58.500> anyway<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.760> decide

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
transparent anyway because if you decide

I'm<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> simplify<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.530> cheap<00:01:22.950> now

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I'm going to simplify that cheap now

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.649 
I'm going to simplify that cheap now
it's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> raster<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:25.009> I'm<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.659> command

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it's a raster and I'm going to command

click on Mac ctrl click I think on a pc
or<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> magic<00:01:32.909> wand<00:01:33.240> tool<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.020> will

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
or just use a magic wand tool that will

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.910 
or just use a magic wand tool that will
select<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.829> now<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> select<00:01:36.570> modify<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
select it now go to select modify it and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.929 
select it now go to select modify it and
smooth<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.740> change<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> radius<00:01:41.250> depending

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
smooth and change the radius depending

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.649 
smooth and change the radius depending
on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.479> size<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:43.020> image<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.360> see

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
on the size of your image and you see

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.030 
on the size of your image and you see
now<00:01:46.290> we've<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:47.399> sharp<00:01:47.700> corners<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> now

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
now we've got some sharp corners so now

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.120 
now we've got some sharp corners so now
go<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.909> select<00:01:51.390> modify<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> smoothly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
go to you select modify and smoothly

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
go to you select modify and smoothly
again<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.810> click<00:01:55.110> ok<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.030> I've<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> nice

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
again and click ok now I've got a nice

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
again and click ok now I've got a nice
smooth<00:01:58.399> roundness<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:00.469> if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.619> push<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
smooth roundness and if you push the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.109 
smooth roundness and if you push the
lead<00:02:02.280> um<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.710> only<00:02:05.579> delete<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
lead um it's going to only delete the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.839 
lead um it's going to only delete the
sign<00:02:06.329> about<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> corners<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.429> need<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> go

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
sign about the corners so we need to go

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.199 
sign about the corners so we need to go
up<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> select<00:02:09.539> inverse<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:11.099> hit<00:02:11.610> delete<00:02:11.640> or

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
up to select inverse then hit delete or

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.839 
up to select inverse then hit delete or
backspace

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
backspace

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.460 
backspace
and<00:02:14.849> now<00:02:14.970> I've<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.269> round<00:02:15.540> corners<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.409> are

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and now I've got round corners that are

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.520 
and now I've got round corners that are
pretty<00:02:16.950> smoothly<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.730> now<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.569> going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.140> do

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
pretty smoothly so now I'm going to do

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.649 
pretty smoothly so now I'm going to do
some<00:02:19.860> type<00:02:20.220> stuff<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> type<00:02:22.560> mask<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
some type stuff I'm on the type mask to

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:32.000 
some type stuff I'm on the type mask to
right<00:02:24.659> now<00:02:29.390> that's<00:02:30.390> made<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> selection<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.920> I'm

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
right now that's made a selection so I'm

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.520 
right now that's made a selection so I'm
going<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.280> hit<00:02:32.340> delete<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.170> minute<00:02:34.170> sleep

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
going to hit delete and a minute sleep

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.610 
going to hit delete and a minute sleep
on<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:35.129> bottom<00:02:35.459> layer<00:02:35.760> again<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.620> that's

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
on this bottom layer again and that's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.309 
on this bottom layer again and that's
our<00:02:37.980> image<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.269> saving<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> got<00:02:39.989> three

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
our image so for saving you got three

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.170 
our image so for saving you got three
formats<00:02:40.769> with<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.160> web<00:02:42.170> you've<00:02:43.170> got<00:02:44.180> Jeff

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
formats with the web you've got Jeff

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.309

which<00:02:45.900> I'll<00:02:46.260> need<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.069> want<00:02:47.310> animation

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
which I'll need when I want animation

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.530 
which I'll need when I want animation
just<00:02:49.319> do<00:02:49.500> transparency<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> support

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
just do transparency and the support

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.699 
just do transparency and the support
animation<00:02:52.640> colors<00:02:53.640> keep<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.480> most<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.379> do

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
animation colors keep on most you can do

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.900 
animation colors keep on most you can do
that's<00:02:56.480> 256<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> change<00:02:59.700> your

that the place ok the next um format is

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.819 
that the place ok the next um format is
PNG<00:03:13.250> there's<00:03:14.250> two<00:03:14.519> pages<00:03:15.060> there's<00:03:15.390> eight

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
PNG there's two pages there's eight

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.690 
PNG there's two pages there's eight
which<00:03:16.829> only<00:03:17.129> does<00:03:17.459> transparency<00:03:18.389> and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
which only does transparency and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.789 
which only does transparency and
generally<00:03:20.700> makes<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.750> smaller<00:03:22.079> file<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.769> this

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
generally makes a smaller file like this

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.250 
generally makes a smaller file like this
is<00:03:23.220> three<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:25.019> half<00:03:25.049> okay<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.840> one

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
is three and a half okay and that's one

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.680 
is three and a half okay and that's one
point<00:03:28.650> three<00:03:28.799> four<00:03:29.280> mags<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.540> lot

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
point three four mags so it's a lot

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.370 
point three four mags so it's a lot
smaller<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:33.090> we've<00:03:33.269> got<00:03:33.299> PNG<00:03:33.959> 24<00:03:34.590> which<00:03:35.280> is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
smaller then we've got PNG 24 which is

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.039 
smaller then we've got PNG 24 which is
twice<00:03:37.380> big<00:03:37.889> ish<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:40.970> does<00:03:41.970> transparency<00:03:42.870> and

in mind if you do in PNG ate their
colors<00:04:13.230> are<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:14.129> the<00:04:14.370> most<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:14.790> go<00:04:15.000> since<00:04:15.359> 256

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810

24<00:04:18.859> has<00:04:19.859> pretty<00:04:20.340> much<00:04:20.519> unlimited<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.329> don't

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
24 has pretty much unlimited so don't

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.529 
24 has pretty much unlimited so don't
worry<00:04:21.870> there<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.520> cancel<00:04:23.909> out<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> then

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
worry there so just cancel out and then

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.410 
worry there so just cancel out and then
we're<00:04:24.659> going<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.840> open<00:04:25.140> up<00:04:25.260> my

we're going to open up my

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
set the web page and there it is Susie

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.220 
set the web page and there it is Susie
and<00:04:31.650> meet<00:04:31.890> you<00:04:31.980> Jeff<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.970> blinking<00:04:33.540> between

and meet you Jeff it's blinking between

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.210 
and meet you Jeff it's blinking between
the<00:04:35.150> rounded<00:04:36.150> rectangle<00:04:37.140> layer<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:40.220> red

the rounded rectangle layer and the red

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.580 
the rounded rectangle layer and the red
background<00:04:41.750> that's<00:04:42.750> why<00:04:43.080> we<00:04:43.320> don't<00:04:43.500> see

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
background that's why we don't see

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.760 
background that's why we don't see
anything<00:04:44.060> around<00:04:45.140> corners<00:04:46.140> except<00:04:46.680> the
