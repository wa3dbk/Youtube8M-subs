00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.590
 Nine people my name is called acer and 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.750
 I welcome you to a warm welcome 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.079
 my first video in which I give you the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.599
 Want to introduce weapons from skill 2 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.279
 because like me in my info video about 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.289
 October I already said I am 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.540
 Therefore, every single weapon of you 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.930
 skill two to show that's right 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.780
 so many sp points cost money which 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 he can earn in going and you yes 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.720
 not always exactly okay which should 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.239
 I have more to fetch that has a bit 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.469
 biting enough and there is a lot 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.879
 large selection of weapons 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.680
 I want you in every video 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.750
 I expect a little something to say 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.190
 on starts the club on the price 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.629
 and finally I will show you 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.770
 also a bit like i have the weapon 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.320
 played as I have felt 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.030
 unrau for you a good advice 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.039
 to give so that you know in 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.160
 which weapon is invested without which 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.320
 weapon works here and catch today 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.450
 we with the first assault rifle on that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.060
 I bought myself then at the time 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.770
 beginning with my sp constant at the beginning 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.040
 of the game get quite a lot and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.790
 though with the assault rifle skate that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.939
 mute the skate will cost you proud 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.490
 16,000 sp points or accordingly 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.700
 149 points brings you a magazine where 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.549
 you have 25 shots and a total of 1 75 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.290
 stock +25 inside last magazine in the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.659
 it is quite high 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.829
 settled with 67 out of 100 possible 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.040
 damage points 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.640
 the fire rate is 67 out of 100 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.520
 relatively high as having 31 out of 100 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.610
 quite low recoil and with 79 of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.340
 100 a pretty high precision 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.000
 Overall, it is more of a 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.159
 I would say mediocre rifle 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.450
 that it is quite balanced and leaves 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.680
 Accordingly, very well 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.810
 play so that cage is a gas pressure 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.780
 stock with high reliability the first 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 since april 2009 is manufactured and ins 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.180
 target 2 availible for you but 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.220
 Now enough of the data because I will be here 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.329
 not exactly and meticulously in comparison 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 but i just want you 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.420
 basically call the data first 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.340
 and then I'll tell you directly 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.170
 little bit to the gameplay with this one 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 weapon with which he is cage I am already 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.230
 the long road to be it's like I 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.980
 But one of the first weapons said that 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.200
 I got myself 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.450
 that we think she is quite good at that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.800
 such a small slightly larger visor 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.170
 there you can look through it well 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.110
 you get the opponents in the comb well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.180
 take as you say and how beautiful 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.850
 the weapon plays from the feeling is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.550
 the skate a very good assault rifle 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.560
 in the middle distance that means if 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.260
 the enemy is too far away it is up 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.599
 definitely not be the best the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.610
 your best choice if i say so 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.700
 Good middle distance is present then 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.860
 This is not an almost perfect charging time 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 he relatively fast I call no here 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.040
 exact values ​​as always that's all 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.390
 a little bit more feeling in the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.610
 compared to other weapons so have 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.690
 you reloaded me pretty fast 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.640
 synonymous find the ammunition size 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.739
 perfectly okay if through the through 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.720
 the slightly higher damage spot this 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.459
 weapon does not need it accordingly 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.170
 quite as many shots at an opponent 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.540
 kill 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.519
 what can I say first how 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.170
 it is so that i have the feeling 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.230
 have it for a long time 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.090
 but the yes I say the efficiency 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.880
 this weapon city wears off though 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.220
 is a relatively small recoil 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.910
 At 31 years of age, a fairly high precision 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.730
 with 79 I have the feeling that it is 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.190
 very forgiving and a very high yes 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.260
 Ball spread on something longer 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.540
 Distance means that means I am 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.750
 someone who likes the sketch then rather like that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.350
 in burst mode you can play that 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.690
 of course not 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.940
 Unfortunately I do not want to stop but me 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.790
 do not push through but I try 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.140
 really hold my mouse button always 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.940
 to click on it always so fast 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.430
 to shoot short fire volleys 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.920
 because the longer you then finally 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.690
 it shoots all the more 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.250
 forgiving weapon and that happens very often 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.680
 before they slightly longer on a 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.810
 Distance with the skate shoots and 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.150
 somehow shoots around the enemy 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.160
 does not hit the hut can be 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 with the skater but also relatively good 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 but I prefer the mode 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.889
 Preferences I would like to say and how 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.000
 had all weapons should you but 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.950
 keep trying to get upside down 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.190
 pull because it applies two brings that 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.780
 A good deal of headshots are always one 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.210
 safe variant around the opponents too 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 köthen to work on the sky team 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.130
 worth it in my eyes already l 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.110
 right or very much for me it is 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.630
 a good all- rounder so that has 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.690
 for me the perfect mix 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 speed and harm while as well 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.530
 the speed a bit higher 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.910
 if you could do that with the one 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.639
 or other machine gun compares 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.330
 but i would recommend you the skater 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.770
 for slightly larger maps the desert camp 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.200
 where you really want to remove and times 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.120
 see one or the other opponent yes 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.540
 and we can shoot and shoot 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.460
 like for example team deathmatch hanna i think 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.650
 Sketching is not the perfect choice 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.419
 there are better weapons then on 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.490
 short distances are a bit more effective 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.800
 because even short distance is really like that 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.300
 that you are not quite the enemy 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.310
 as good hits so I said said 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.620
 her again I think the sketch is 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.810
 really a very good weapon on the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.330
 at middle distances not so far away 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.190
 not too close and you already have 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.810
 Made a good choice 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.430
 Personally I find the price had 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.400
 now a bit too high for 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.930
 the skate there are quite a lot 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.270
 Machine guns are the ones in mine 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.770
 eyes are a bit better and many are 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.820
 other storm rifles also really 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.890
 a little bit more 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.169
 but it is not a bad weapon it is 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.450
 none on the porte weapon and if you are 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.130
 coincidentally still with the m4a 1 circulation 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.900
 which he is the standard weapon one man 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.640
 then you should get here 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.400
 maybe still thinking about the sketch 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.750
 umzuschwenken so that's all 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.060
 have been what I weapon to you 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.950
 I can and want to say personally 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.330
 I really enjoy eating games 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.710
 I am also reasonably good with it 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.810
 perform but there are here and there 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.640
 Of course they are a bit better weapon 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.020
 run with me 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.060
 I hope these videos will be yours 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.430
 fallen and I'm up there a little bit 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.270
 instructed you because I currently have 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.550
 the skate the p90 of course the mk 1 and 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.590
 then I have the mp 7 something 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.750
 all of the chromatic since I am yes 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.610
 got the vip-status and a 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.760
 to level up a bit faster 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.260
 compared to spending no money 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.320
 I will give you these two other weapons 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.020
 In any case, show what I have 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.190
 Show you then that I hope I can 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.050
 you tell me because I have a bit 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.819
 cash have been considered 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.620
 to buy her a few weapons 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.970
 can show you around here and there 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.409
 I am simply dependent on that 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.759
 told him what weapon do you want 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.159
 maybe pick which weapon should i pick 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.319
 show you someone because yes even if 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.270
 Enough so I do not want too much 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.800
 invest money and so it goes on 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.659
 no case for all weapons so i 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.370
 buy a mix of weapons and 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.389
 Weapons play freely through the sp 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.129
 make points 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.810
 that's how it should be 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.110
 be from my little guards review 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.120
 all about the skating skill 2 i hope 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.560
 you had fun it that you one 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.479
 little the decision easier 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.919
 which weapon bought and maybe 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.509
 Let's see you in my next one 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.620
 video and until then say ciao 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:21.620
 I'm here once out 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.020
 if it
