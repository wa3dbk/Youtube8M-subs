00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.870
 let's finish our rose first 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 we are going to remove the temporary axes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.269
 that so far we have served we remove 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.040
 from the display of the axes 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 forecast and do something 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.039
 interesting therefore we want to realize 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.189
 a solidworks thread is called 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 cosmetic threading on these little ones 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.820
 Diameters of the center of the way to do 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.279
 this we must first go 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.370
 on the tools menu at the bottom we choose 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.730
 options from options the property sheet 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.680
 of the document we go into details and in 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.950
 details we must put the mark of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.539
 check in the first box cola at the top where 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.719
 written cosmetic threads 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.899
 shaded places the check mark 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.969
 and I confirm what I wanted to do 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.930
 at this point we make this way from the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 menu insert then we go to the bottom there 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 are annotations annotations and there are 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.700
 cosmetic thread I click on it 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.500
 this box opens up 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.400
 here from a strong I approach the point ago 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.200
 fly the thread and indicate a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.790
 in fact he tells me to select the edge of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 a circular pattern for insertion 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.520
 of the cosmetic thread as an edge 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 I indicate this is the filleting and already 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 12 x 15 x I did a test before 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
 to record the video 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.750
 I can change the length of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.040
 15 mm long prophecy I tell him he blinds 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 which ends here in Czech and at this point 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.079
 I confirm the execution, here it is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 cosmetic threading same work 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.020
 I do on the opposite side of the stud 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.140
 on the other hand the exception 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.929
 or before asking for the function 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.170
 enter thread annotations la 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.149
 cosmetic that is not burgundy 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.219
 this is the exact bold then the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.910
 bordeaux 1 the gate with the bordeaux 2 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:14.709
 and I indicate how deep it is in 15 mm 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.299
 threading and I type ok well at this 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.799
 point two were made 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:25.360
 cosmetic threads and I do not stay 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.519
 for the moment give a material to everything 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.200
 to all this design to give the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.560
 material to all this design here 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.590
 I can do this so I select the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.170
 the first processing that the revolution 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.870
 holding down the shift key I go to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.849
 even press the last practically le 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.769
 completely select all from 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.870
 I click on the pockets on the right 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.930
 first button this whole sphere 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.930
 colored and choose between metals 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.239
 opens the metal tab chrome double click 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.220
 and I choose chrome plate I do 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.900
 double click 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.109
 I confirm the window that opened to me 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.049
 beside and I click in an empty space 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:13.630
 of the graphic area at this point the 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.970
 material is all totally made of 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.100
 chrome steel this for color 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.530
 at this point we are loved 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 select the upper floor lo 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.109
 we put it normal and open a sketch e 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.290
 let's build what is the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.410
 outer tire the tire you will need to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.840
 finish our our wheel 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.040
 let's open a sketch as I said e 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.680
 we choose offset entities as entities 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.859
 offset we choose here we can put 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.790
 a measure and as a measure we put for 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.889
 example 40 mm these 40 mm we go to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.330
 select where we want to do the ocse 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.880
 the offset that this here 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.400
 practically a circle is made 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.690
 larger than the one there of 40 mm sky 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.910
 indicated below we exit from the sketch 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.800
 keeping the sketch selected let's go 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.350
 in the functions tab we do 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.330
 basic extrusion this point as you can 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.460
 see now we have learned to 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.040
 to know the program this case I would do 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.140
 a circle that includes all the rose 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.010
 I would n't do just a little thickness 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:26.930
 so what should i do choose function 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.910
 subtle as a subtle function indeed 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.360
 let's step back into condition 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.760
 of term rather than blind as I choose 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.820
 intermediate plan because we have set ourselves 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.310
 on the upper floor so we are on 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.160
 center of the wheel axis as 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.380
 thickness and put 20 mm because it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.260
 how thick our wheel is 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.370
 how we made it 20 mm wide 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.800
 single direction 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.810
 I do this this thickness will have to 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.470
 correspond exactly to what was done 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.020
 the offset that I did 40 mm to this 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.400
 point I realize that for 40 mm go 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.440
 therefore in the opposite direction 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.360
 through this here direction 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.250
 against filing from the opposite side 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.570
 so they fit together perfectly 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.760
 with the circle I confirm the function e 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.910
 these as we see already have a color 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:19.250
 different from the object I defined 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.650
 first at this point we leave 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.840
 selected select this 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.120
 thin extrusion we have done e 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.520
 from the menu we go to choose this 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.440
 this colored sphere of aspects 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.900
 same as the one on this side 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.910
 and select this little body cube 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.919
 select this body and go to the 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.050
 I choose metal rubber beach I open rubber 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:50.530
 that brilliance and I double 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:53.380
 click on the bright rubber I confirm with 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.660
 property manager here on the left and 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.110
 clicking an empty space or mine 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.520
 outdoor rubber to the rose this time 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.780
 all I have to do is make small ones 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.930
 finishings I can link say 2 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.420
 mm the inside of the circle because before 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.550
 when we designed the sketch me 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.340
 I forgot I do a little e 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.250
 two's agreement here is a small era 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.490
 accord of two from the other side and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.740
 I can still connect a 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.970
 the rubber on the outside does a little 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:31.340
 fitting we make a 4 mm chord e 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.370
 let's go to connect the external edges 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.950
 of the rubber so we rounded a 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.060
 little the tread we say of the 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:45.380
 ours of our wheel in this way 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:48.050
 and we confirm the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.650
 our wheel we can say that that is 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.650
 over
