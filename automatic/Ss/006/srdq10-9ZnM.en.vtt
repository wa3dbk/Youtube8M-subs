00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the curl pattern I mean like I kind of I

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.880 
the curl pattern I mean like I kind of I
mean<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.329> like<00:02:57.690> both<00:02:57.930> curl<00:02:58.200> patterns<00:02:58.620> it's

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
mean I I like both curl patterns it's

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.770 
mean I I like both curl patterns it's
just<00:02:59.130> when<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.670> switch<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.000> up<00:03:00.209> if<00:03:00.540> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
just when you want to switch it up if I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.509 
just when you want to switch it up if I
really<00:03:01.079> want<00:03:01.320> no<00:03:02.010> effort<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:04.280> loose<00:03:05.280> wave

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
really want no effort to loose wave

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.640 
really want no effort to loose wave
pattern<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.540> Nick<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:07.019> curls<00:03:07.470> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
pattern like really Nick one curls I

Billy here is like from so long ago but

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.830 
Billy here is like from so long ago but
I<00:03:46.380> did<00:03:46.950> test<00:03:47.160> your<00:03:47.400> both<00:03:47.670> ships<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.299> both<00:03:48.810> of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
I did test your both ships and both of

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.500 
I did test your both ships and both of
them<00:03:49.079> take<00:03:49.380> died<00:03:49.799> so<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.489> you're<00:03:51.329> worried

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
them take died so if you're worried

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.740 
them take died so if you're worried
about<00:03:51.630> dying<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:53.010> that's<00:03:53.940> not<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.150> problem

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
about dying then that's not a problem

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.220 
about dying then that's not a problem
I<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:54.900> think<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.799> VI

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
I do think that the VI

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.089 
I do think that the VI
you<00:03:56.319> TiVo<00:03:58.560> wanted<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.650> die

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
you TiVo wanted to die

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.100 
you TiVo wanted to die
it<00:04:00.159> still<00:04:00.549> feels<00:04:00.760> softer<00:04:01.480> well<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.019> was

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
it still feels softer well it was

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.690 
it still feels softer well it was
already<00:04:02.319> originally<00:04:02.890> softer<00:04:03.280> but<00:04:03.489> it's

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
already originally softer but it's

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.390 
already originally softer but it's
softer<00:04:04.390> than<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:05.319> believed<00:04:05.650> that<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.069> said

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
softer than the believed that I said

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.729 
softer than the believed that I said
that<00:04:06.610> it<00:04:07.180> wasn't<00:04:07.390> asked<00:04:07.870> off<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.200> begin<00:04:08.530> with

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
that it wasn't asked off to begin with

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.020 
that it wasn't asked off to begin with
when<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.280> die<00:04:09.549> if<00:04:09.790> Oh<00:04:11.519> what<00:04:12.519> else<00:04:12.670> can<00:04:12.879> I<00:04:13.000> say

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
when you die if Oh what else can I say

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.229 
when you die if Oh what else can I say

this<00:04:44.169> hair<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.440> way<00:04:44.919> easier<00:04:44.949> than<00:04:45.400> washing<00:04:45.729> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
this hair is way easier than washing the

this hair is way easier than washing the
booty<00:04:46.180> here<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.419> might<00:04:46.660> say<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:46.889> because<00:04:47.889> if

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010

more<00:06:59.800> easy<00:07:00.010> to<00:07:00.160> weight<00:07:01.090> easier<00:07:01.510> to<00:07:01.720> maintain

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
more easy to weight easier to maintain

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.450 
more easy to weight easier to maintain
and<00:07:03.300> deal<00:07:04.300> with<00:07:04.540> on<00:07:04.990> a<00:07:05.050> regular<00:07:05.230> do<00:07:05.800> you<00:07:05.950> basis

so<00:07:06.760> I<00:07:07.060> would<00:07:07.390> definitely<00:07:07.840> choose<00:07:08.140> if<00:07:08.770> I<00:07:08.980> have

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
so I would definitely choose if I have

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.220 
so I would definitely choose if I have
to<00:07:09.280> choose<00:07:09.930> personally<00:07:12.900> probably<00:07:13.900> choose<00:07:14.110> the

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:14.230 
to choose personally probably choose the

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.490 
to choose personally probably choose the
one<00:07:14.380> that's<00:07:14.410> easier<00:07:14.890> to<00:07:14.950> maintain<00:07:15.220> but

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 
one that's easier to maintain but

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.100 
one that's easier to maintain but
because<00:07:17.500> I<00:07:17.620> swear<00:07:18.040> my<00:07:18.190> hair<00:07:18.340> on<00:07:18.460> wigs<00:07:18.930> okay<00:07:19.930> if

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
because I swear my hair on wigs okay if

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.170 
because I swear my hair on wigs okay if

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
would choose this hair because the hair

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.310 
would choose this hair because the hair
has<00:07:24.670> to<00:07:24.790> stay<00:07:25.000> in<00:07:25.060> my<00:07:25.210> head<00:07:25.390> but<00:07:25.870> because<00:07:26.200> I'm
