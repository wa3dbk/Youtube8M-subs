00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.589 
right mind when I'm doing this exercise
because<00:00:24.279> this<00:00:24.699> is<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:24.970> triple<00:00:25.300> hybrid

exercising I'm going to be doing is
dumbbell<00:00:29.470> bench<00:00:29.590> press<00:00:29.740> I've<00:00:30.429> got<00:00:30.640> 105-pound

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
dumbbell bench press I've got 105-pound

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.860 
dumbbell bench press I've got 105-pound
dumbbells<00:00:31.810> here<00:00:32.050> I'm<00:00:32.830> also<00:00:33.100> going<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.460> be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
dumbbells here I'm also going to be

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.030 
dumbbells here I'm also going to be
working<00:00:34.870> with<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.230> chains<00:00:35.470> attached<00:00:35.830> to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
working with the chains attached to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.009 
working with the chains attached to
those<00:00:36.129> dumbbells<00:00:36.610> these<00:00:37.180> are<00:00:37.330> 20.com<00:00:37.720> chains

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
those dumbbells these are 20.com chains

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.840 
those dumbbells these are 20.com chains
I've<00:00:38.620> got<00:00:38.860> some<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.460> length<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.790> chain

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
I've got some of the length of chain

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.250 
I've got some of the length of chain
it's<00:00:40.269> going<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> be<00:00:40.540> double<00:00:40.780> up<00:00:40.900> so<00:00:41.110> it's

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
it's going to be double up so it's

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.780 
it's going to be double up so it's
mostly<00:00:41.710> off<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> ground<00:00:42.250> when<00:00:42.370> I'm<00:00:42.460> doing<00:00:42.579> the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
mostly off the ground when I'm doing the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.479 
mostly off the ground when I'm doing the
exercise<00:00:43.239> now<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.680> reason<00:00:44.799> that's<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.190> hybrid

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
exercise now the reason that's a hybrid

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.149 
exercise now the reason that's a hybrid
one<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.909> as<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.690> chain<00:00:46.930> collects<00:00:47.799> more<00:00:47.979> on<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
one is as the chain collects more on the

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.039 
one is as the chain collects more on the
ground<00:00:48.369> actually<00:00:49.119> reduces<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> weight<00:00:49.809> I'm

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
ground actually reduces the weight I'm

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.450 
ground actually reduces the weight I'm
pushing<00:00:50.320> up<00:00:50.409> the<00:00:50.440> block<00:00:50.650> so<00:00:50.979> as<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.220> push<00:00:51.430> back

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
pushing up the block so as I push back

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.549 
pushing up the block so as I push back
up<00:00:51.790> I'm<00:00:52.570> thinking<00:00:52.930> or<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.199> chain<00:00:53.379> off<00:00:53.500> the

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
up I'm thinking or the chain off the

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.530 
up I'm thinking or the chain off the
ground<00:00:53.860> it's<00:00:54.129> increasing<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.850> weight<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.479> a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
ground it's increasing the weight that a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.630 
ground it's increasing the weight that a
pushing<00:00:56.019> which<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:56.799> directly<00:00:57.129> in<00:00:57.430> line<00:00:57.460> with

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
pushing which is directly in line with

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.429 
pushing which is directly in line with
the<00:00:57.850> strength<00:00:58.089> curve<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.479> adventurous<00:00:58.989> now

00:00:59.429 --> 00:00:59.439 
the strength curve of adventurous now

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:02.189 
the strength curve of adventurous now
what<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.250> decided<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:00.760> add<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.180> one<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.809> a

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
what I decided to add to this one is a

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.240 
what I decided to add to this one is a
cable<00:01:03.040> crossover<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:05.320> I'm<00:01:05.770> doing<00:01:06.100> this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
cable crossover and as I'm doing this

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.310 
cable crossover and as I'm doing this
I'm<00:01:07.060> going<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.270> be<00:01:07.360> reducing<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.049> way<00:01:08.170> at<00:01:08.260> the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
I'm going to be reducing the way at the

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140 
I'm going to be reducing the way at the
bottom<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.799> cable<00:01:09.070> crossover<00:01:09.580> it's<00:01:10.090> not

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
bottom with the cable crossover it's not

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.280 
bottom with the cable crossover it's not
going<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.390> give<00:01:10.479> me<00:01:10.570> much<00:01:10.689> resistance<00:01:10.960> at<00:01:11.259> the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
going to give me much resistance at the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.320 
going to give me much resistance at the
boat<00:01:11.500> as<00:01:11.799> I<00:01:12.369> come<00:01:12.549> up<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.729> bring<00:01:13.150> their<00:01:13.299> own

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
boat as I come up and bring their own

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.440 
boat as I come up and bring their own
kin<00:01:13.630> that's<00:01:14.619> when<00:01:14.890> cable<00:01:15.250> crossover<00:01:15.760> is<00:01:16.240> going

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
kin that's when cable crossover is going

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.790 
kin that's when cable crossover is going
to<00:01:16.510> give<00:01:16.630> me<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> resistance<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.500> basically

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
to give me the resistance it's basically

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.450 
to give me the resistance it's basically
what<00:01:17.980> we<00:01:18.100> do

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
what we do

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.270 
what we do
cable<00:01:18.850> flight<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:19.960> cables<00:01:20.380> as<00:01:20.650> I've<00:01:21.159> got

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
cable flight with the cables as I've got

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.710 
cable flight with the cables as I've got
them<00:01:21.490> both<00:01:21.640> loaded<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.150> as<00:01:22.299> I've<00:01:22.450> got<00:01:22.600> the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
them both loaded and as I've got the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.630 
them both loaded and as I've got the
chains<00:01:22.990> increasing<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.590> resistance<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.520> this

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
chains increasing the resistance so this

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.460 
chains increasing the resistance so this
is<00:01:24.760> really<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.299> add<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.570> substantial

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
is really going to add a substantial

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.750 
is really going to add a substantial
amount<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.740> resistance<00:01:26.950> as<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.460> bring<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
amount of resistance as I bring the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.060 
amount of resistance as I bring the
elbows<00:01:28.030> up<00:01:28.210> indoors<00:01:28.630> top<00:01:28.869> resulting<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.979> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
elbows up indoors top resulting in a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.890 
elbows up indoors top resulting in a
great<00:01:30.340> contraction<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.090> some<00:01:31.240> great<00:01:31.420> muscle

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
great contraction and some great muscle

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.420 
great contraction and some great muscle
building<00:01:32.080> training<00:01:32.380> now<00:01:32.979> obviously<00:01:33.310> I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
building training now obviously I'm

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.770 
building training now obviously I'm
going<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.610> need<00:01:33.670> some<00:01:33.850> special<00:01:34.060> equipment<00:01:34.270> if

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
going to need some special equipment if

what you might want to try it if you
breathe<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.259> kinda<00:01:47.440> like<00:01:47.530> me<00:01:48.450> I'll<00:01:49.450> it's<00:01:49.899> a

attached<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> dumbbells<00:02:24.980> I'm<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.000> going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
attached to the dumbbells I'm just going

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.550 
attached to the dumbbells I'm just going
to<00:02:26.180> pick<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.450> whole<00:02:26.569> mess<00:02:26.720> up<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> start

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
to pick the whole mess up and start

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:51.460 
to pick the whole mess up and start
moving<00:02:27.650> pressing

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.650 

Oh

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:36.099 

ah

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.709 

so<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.140> generally<00:03:37.590> do<00:03:37.709> my<00:03:37.829> best<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.189> to<00:03:38.250> square

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:38.719 
so I generally do my best not to square

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.880 
so I generally do my best not to square
what<00:03:39.719> I'm<00:03:39.810> doing<00:03:40.019> these<00:03:40.140> exercises<00:03:40.200> on

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
what I'm doing these exercises on

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.110 
what I'm doing these exercises on
videarn<00:03:41.299> but<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.590> really<00:03:43.590> Kate<00:03:43.769> Plus<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.879> that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
videarn but I really Kate Plus on that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.869 
videarn but I really Kate Plus on that
way<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.290> absolutely<00:03:47.359> credibly<00:03:48.379> the

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
way that is absolutely credibly the

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.149 
way that is absolutely credibly the
stress<00:03:50.879> at<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.030> bottom<00:03:51.120> very<00:03:51.959> good<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.409> I<00:03:53.040> was

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
stress at the bottom very good as I was

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.459 
stress at the bottom very good as I was
coming<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.579> top<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:54.060> felt<00:03:54.930> my<00:03:55.019> pecs<00:03:55.260> light

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:55.469 
coming to the top I felt my pecs light

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.429 
coming to the top I felt my pecs light
up<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.700> never<00:03:56.849> fell<00:03:57.120> from<00:03:57.209> before<00:03:57.510> I'm

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
up like I never fell from before I'm

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.780 
up like I never fell from before I'm
going<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.739> another<00:03:58.859> set<00:03:59.129> of<00:03:59.219> this<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.489> just

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
going to do another set of this is just

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.750 
going to do another set of this is just
ridiculously<00:04:00.299> good<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:01.250> if<00:04:02.250> you've<00:04:02.430> got<00:04:02.579> the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
ridiculously good so if you've got the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.289 
ridiculously good so if you've got the
women<00:04:03.260> definitely<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.650> monster<00:04:05.040> i

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
women definitely get this monster i

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.809 
women definitely get this monster i
start<00:04:06.299> with<00:04:06.389> lighter<00:04:06.569> weight<00:04:07.310> because<00:04:08.310> they<00:04:08.519> I

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
start with lighter weight because they I

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.110 
start with lighter weight because they I
think<00:04:09.799> starting<00:04:10.799> with<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:10.950> 10<00:04:11.159> flights<00:04:11.459> loading

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
think starting with a 10 flights loading

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.210 
think starting with a 10 flights loading
all<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.359> on<00:04:12.540> great<00:04:13.409> for<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> lower<00:04:13.739> strength

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
all this on great for a lower strength

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.789 
all this on great for a lower strength
or<00:04:14.519> even<00:04:14.849> set<00:04:15.060> but<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.019> really<00:04:16.169> maximize<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
or even set but to really maximize the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.589 
or even set but to really maximize the
tension<00:04:17.099> on<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.250> muscle<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:18.150> probably<00:04:18.389> want

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
tension on the muscle you probably want

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.029 
tension on the muscle you probably want
to<00:04:18.660> go<00:04:18.750> for<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> bit<00:04:19.079> higher<00:04:19.229> reps<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.709> liking

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
to go for a bit higher reps of liking

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.720 
to go for a bit higher reps of liking
you<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.699> five<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.030> seven<00:04:21.329> reps<00:04:21.539> per<00:04:21.599> set
