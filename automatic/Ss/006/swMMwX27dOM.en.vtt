just<00:00:11.879> have<00:00:12.030> your<00:00:12.150> mind<00:00:12.389> blown<00:00:13.160> about<00:00:14.160> what

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
just have your mind blown about what

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.179 
just have your mind blown about what
lasers<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.879> what<00:00:15.449> lasers<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
lasers are what lasers do in the

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.130 
lasers are what lasers do in the
conventional<00:00:17.939> sense<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.960> with

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
conventional sense and what we do with

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.909 
conventional sense and what we do with
them<00:00:20.840> there<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.019> no<00:00:22.199> laser<00:00:22.380> clinic<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
them there is no laser clinic in the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.319 
them there is no laser clinic in the
world<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> does<00:00:23.429> what<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.210> do

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:24.329 
world that does what we do we do

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.880 
world that does what we do we do
something<00:00:24.630> called<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.929> multiple<00:00:25.410> modality

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
something called a multiple modality

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
something called a multiple modality
approach<00:00:26.249> which<00:00:26.579> means<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.909> use<00:00:26.999> many<00:00:27.300> many

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
approach which means we use many many

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
approach which means we use many many
lasers<00:00:27.810> together<00:00:28.380> synergistically<00:00:29.060> nobody

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
lasers together synergistically nobody

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
lasers together synergistically nobody
else<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> world<00:00:30.779> does<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:32.099> allows

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
else in the world does that that allows

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
else in the world does that that allows
you<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.790> incredibly<00:00:33.300> precise<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:34.020> where

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you to be incredibly precise about where

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
you to be incredibly precise about where
energy<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.310> what<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.550> doing<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
energy is going and what it's doing in

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.890 
energy is going and what it's doing in
that<00:00:36.420> tissue<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> very

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
that tissue and that we have a very

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.870 
that tissue and that we have a very
holistic<00:00:40.290> approach<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> use<00:00:41.310> of<00:00:41.340> lasers

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
holistic approach to the use of lasers

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.420 
holistic approach to the use of lasers
which<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.260> face<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.770> seems<00:00:44.070> almost

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
which on the face of it seems almost

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
which on the face of it seems almost
like<00:00:44.610> an<00:00:44.880> oxymoron<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.690> mean<00:00:45.960> who<00:00:46.020> ever<00:00:46.140> heard

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
like an oxymoron I mean who ever heard

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.800 
like an oxymoron I mean who ever heard
of<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.710> term<00:00:46.920> laser<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.790> holistic<00:00:48.060> used<00:00:48.600> in

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
of the term laser and holistic used in

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.600 
of the term laser and holistic used in
the<00:00:48.930> same<00:00:49.170> book<00:00:49.410> let<00:00:50.010> alone<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> same

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the same book let alone the same

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.390 
the same book let alone the same
sentence<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.720> yet<00:00:51.900> we<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.290> that<00:00:52.560> so<00:00:52.830> the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
sentence but yet we do that so the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.520 
sentence but yet we do that so the
procedures<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.150> do<00:00:54.360> change<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
procedures that we do change the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.500 
procedures that we do change the

very first procedure we doing deals with
vascular<00:01:16.200> things<00:01:16.620> as<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:17.370> example<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
vascular things as an example this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.540 
vascular things as an example this
patient<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.200> large<00:01:19.409> nasal<00:01:20.010> vein<00:01:20.370> on

the side of their nose and after the
first<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> seven<00:01:23.159> procedures<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
first of the seven procedures and the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.770 
first of the seven procedures and the
spectra<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.620> there<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.070> go<00:01:26.220> oh

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
spectra here we go and there we go oh

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
spectra here we go and there we go oh
yeah<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.110> good<00:01:28.380> cool<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.600> 14<00:01:31.350> from<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
yeah very good cool and just 14 from the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
yeah very good cool and just 14 from the
last<00:01:32.400> night<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.330> noticed<00:01:33.900> such<00:01:34.080> as<00:01:34.260> such<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
last night and I noticed such as such a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
last night and I noticed such as such a
difference<00:01:34.830> with<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.400> yeah<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.120> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
difference with just one yeah as I I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.510 
difference with just one yeah as I I
think<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.630> would<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.810> concluded<00:01:37.520> completely

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
think it would be concluded completely

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
think it would be concluded completely
erased<00:01:38.940> yeah<00:01:39.600> 3

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
erased yeah 3

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.120 
erased yeah 3
yes<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.659> procedure<00:01:43.109> can<00:01:43.409> legitimately

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
yes this procedure can legitimately

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.319 
yes this procedure can legitimately
remove<00:01:44.939> owl<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.890> marionette<00:01:47.340> line<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
remove owl and a marionette line and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.370 
remove owl and a marionette line and
that's<00:01:48.539> what<00:01:48.659> she's<00:01:48.810> beginning<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> develop

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's what she's beginning to develop

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.959 
that's what she's beginning to develop
right<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.039> marionette<00:01:50.520> line<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.819> see

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
right there a marionette line you see

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.639 
right there a marionette line you see
the<00:01:51.060> puffiness<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:51.960> she's<00:01:52.590> just

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the puffiness right there she's just

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
the puffiness right there she's just
beginning<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.880> laxity<00:01:54.299> there<00:01:54.509> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
beginning to get some laxity there so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.929 
beginning to get some laxity there so
jowls<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.469> beginning<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.950> form<00:01:56.219> because

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
jowls are just beginning to form because

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
jowls are just beginning to form because
what<00:01:57.270> used<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.539> be<00:01:57.600> there<00:01:57.899> isn't<00:01:58.200> there

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
what used to be there isn't there
