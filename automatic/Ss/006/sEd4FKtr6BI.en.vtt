the partitions also go all the way down

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.900 
the partitions also go all the way down
to<00:01:06.740> ground<00:01:07.009> level<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.580> there's<00:01:07.759> no

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
to ground level so there's no

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.270 
to ground level so there's no
possibility<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.720> horses<00:01:09.470> treading<00:01:09.860> into<00:01:10.039> the

other horses area it also has this

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.380 
other horses area it also has this
really<00:01:14.390> useful<00:01:14.960> caged<00:01:15.890> area<00:01:16.400> here<00:01:16.820> for<00:01:17.060> extra

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
really useful caged area here for extra

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
really useful caged area here for extra
equipment<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:18.409> very<00:01:18.650> important<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.190> this

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
equipment it's very important that this

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.880 
equipment it's very important that this
area<00:01:19.760> is<00:01:19.970> caged<00:01:20.390> like<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.740> your

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
area is caged like this so that your

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.920 
area is caged like this so that your
equipment<00:01:22.310> can't<00:01:22.549> fall<00:01:22.790> out<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.210> onto<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
horses so just racks won't do here it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.710 
horses so just racks won't do here it
needs<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.110> caging<00:01:27.880> there's<00:01:28.880> also<00:01:29.090> these

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
needs this caging there's also these
