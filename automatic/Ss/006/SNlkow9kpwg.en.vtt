00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.120
 hello how about guys today we will study the 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.120
 physical principle of arquímides 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.529
 suppose we have a tub with water 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.990
 and two cubes of the same dimensions of 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.110
 one meter by one meter by one meter is 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.930
 say a cubic meter one made in 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.239
 iron and the other made of wood if 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.149
 We submerge the iron cube in the water 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.220
 it will sink to the bottom but if 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:36.190
 we put the wooden cube in the water 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.040
 this float to this is explained by 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.550
 of the principle of arquímides which 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.850
 says that every body submerged total or 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.700
 partially in a liquid experience 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.280
 an upward pushing force that is 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.220
 equal to the weight of the liquid volume 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.350
 that evicts one of the main 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.990
 problems to understand the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.560
 Archimedes' principle is to confuse the 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.040
 weight with the dough 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.020
 the weight once and for all and so that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
 to be marked in the brain is a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.740
 force more exactly is the force that 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.120
 exercises the entire mass of the planet earth 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.910
 about the objects that are found 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.310
 about it is why the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.610
 Weight formula is mass by 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 constant of gravity in this case is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.790
 the acceleration of gravity that in the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.410
 Earth is equal to 9.81 meters above 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.380
 second squared 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.540
 note that the weight formula is very 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.990
 similar to that of the force formula 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.410
 which tells us that strength is equal 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.890
 to mass by acceleration in addition to 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.290
 that both weight and strength 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.840
 can be measured in newtons which is what 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.940
 same kilograms per meter on the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.520
 second the square going back to our 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.580
 example let's suppose that our tub and you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 we make a hole exactly at the level 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.320
 of the surface of the water 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.289
 on the other side of the hole we place a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.289
 glass and at this time we submerge the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.989
 iron cube in the tub the water that 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.170
 will displace will overflow through the hole 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.470
 and will be connected in the glass 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.750
 the volume of the displaced liquid will be 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.800
 equal to the volume of the iron cube that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.800
 we just submerged 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.570
 if we put this volume of water 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.570
 displaced on a scale we will have to 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.120
 will have a certain weight this weight is 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.010
 a force which will be equal to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.800
 push force that you experience in 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.770
 our iron cube submerged but in 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.590
 ascending sense as described 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.290
 the principle of archimedes this must be 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.470
 that all the water in the tub also 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.260
 it has a weight that is to say it is affected by 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.420
 the force of gravity of the earth of what 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.880
 otherwise the water would not remain in the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 inside the tub but simply 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.000
 it would fly right now we should 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.810
 remember that if we exert a force 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.490
 it will be distributed with a liquid 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.790
 the same magnitude in all 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.880
 directions this as a result of 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.190
 principle of hydrostatic pressure as well 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 If the liquid is under the effect of 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.080
 force of gravity this force is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.870
 apply in all directions in 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.110
 this moment the submerged iron cube 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.720
 will receive the force of the weight of the water 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.240
 to its surface our iron cube 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.250
 remains at the bottom of the tub due 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.770
 that is heavier than the volume of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.080
 water that displaced this can be 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.590
 check weighing the volume of the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.050
 displaced liquid so it is observed that 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.720
 although having the same volume they have 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.390
 different mass since the more dense the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.390
 iron has a greater amount of mass 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.490
 per unit volume that water this 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.820
 it is checked mathematically 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.090
 compare a cubic meter of iron with 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.730
 a cubic meter of water so we have to 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.239
 a cubic meter of iron that has a 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.299
 density of 7 thousand 874 kilograms on 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.410
 cubic meter will have a mass of 7 thousand 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.050
 834 kilograms while one meter 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.540
 cubic of water which possesses a 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.919
 density of 1000 kilograms per meter 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.050
 cubic will have a mass of one thousand kilograms 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.960
 now that we know the mass of both 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.340
 cube of iron like of the bucket of water 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.639
 we just need to multiply it by the 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.530
 constant of gravity 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.650
 to be able to calculate the weight of both 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.800
 cubes so we observe that the cube of 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.990
 iron is heavier than the bucket of water 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.900
 and that therefore the pushing force 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.389
 which is equal to the weight of the displaced water 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.759
 but in the opposite sense it is 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.949
 insufficient to make the bucket float 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.710
 of iron with what we have as 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.099
 result that we worried about iron to 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.240
 be more dense than water sinks 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.669
 continuing with our explanation of 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.340
 principle of archimedes we will explain 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.520
 now why an iron ship floats 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.189
 in this case we can take our cube 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.879
 of iron of a cubic meter and a mass 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:26.419
 7 thousand 834 kilograms and manufacture with 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.330
 he a ship this ship will have the same 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.419
 mass that our original iron bucket 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.279
 seven thousand 834 kilograms and the same 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.099
 density in this case the iron will have 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.770
 the same density seven thousand 834 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.229
 kilograms per cubic meter without 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.930
 But now that we worried about iron 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.210
 has been transformed into a ship owns 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.060
 a new geometric shape 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.949
 therefore it has a new volume what 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.160
 which will allow our boat 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:58.300
 displace a greater volume of water 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.670
 well now the volume of water displaced 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.890
 We see having a greater weight than the 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.950
 water weight displaced by the bucket of 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.190
 original iron which tells us that the 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.890
 pushing force will be much greater and that 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.410
 therefore our boat will be able to float 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.050
 very good guys with that we finished the 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.090
 today's course and remember to practice and 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.220
 practice that eventually everything 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.440
