 Coconut with chocolate flag very easy 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.570
 of doing 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.400
 we need butter at temperature 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.990
 that's because it's very important to 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.269
 account of the temperature of the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.670
 exact butter and I'll use you 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.590
 coconut oil coconut oil is not 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.119
 done we put on to tan by 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.519
 please is very important to this one we do not 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.710
 you can use this for technicians get

 falling is the coconut oil and what 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.030
 we can get these stores to very 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.910
 good price and the taste is great and it is 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.770
 an unsaturated fat ajam which we 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.039
 is going to give mochis a lot we are going to put 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.859
 our sugar azuquita and we're going to 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.239
 start to creme a bread that easy to 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.160
 do for the kids is going to 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.140
 love the taste the combination of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.840
 coconut with chocolate vale 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.090
 let's create what does cream mean 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.879
 we have said a thousand times that 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.119
 have as ointment type is like a 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.790
 plank that is very important to have 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.070
 always a spatula together and a pudding 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.090
 of chia 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.770
 to savor it and healthy goodness 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 love the smell that starts to come off 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.600
 when we start to burn what only what 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.740
 of the cream with 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.110
 butter with coconut oil 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.470
 where she gets the cream and good dish 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.420
 flour lowers little by little everything 30 with 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 cocoa 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.890
 baking powder 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890
 jude or what 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.579
 one touch 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.670
 everything you are going to put together everything is going to gather 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.350
 in water mill you have truth what is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.130
 the vote is mine you can not porter milk 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 is milk cut in the USA while not 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.390
 serve that is the buttermilk but 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.310
 with which we can replace it with milk 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.410
 with a few drops of lemon so it 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 short and this is for our many 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.790
 minutes when I'm using a powder 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.170
 baking a baking 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.729
 can you say that you have to have a 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.040
 reaction put there's always a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.810
 bit acid part to do 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.110
 reaction and that will help us make the cake 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.270
 can be raised more easily to 5 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.450
 because we have here good in let me 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.880
 bankia beta nothing else is undertaken to mica 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.050
 and physical and chemical physics always 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.750
 remember this let's lower the mixture 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.540
 it is very important to always lower the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.800
 mix I always say it and there are all 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.450
 the boys are copying that relax the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.250
 mind is that it is important but it is 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.850
 that lately today some of you come down 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.560
 mix 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.300
 more desire to travel 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.300
 now we have the eggs ready 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.150
 let's go beating after each 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.150
 edition 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.050
 and we do not increase in front of the speed 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.050
 low speed 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.790
 the egg 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.340
 if you see that it is cut off as it is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.500
 cutting do not worry nothing happens 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.510
 we are adding a liquid with the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.100
 fat and you start to cut strength 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.490
 this happens automatically 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.590
 third egg 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.960
 and we are ready I have my oven 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.920
 preheated to 350 I always use 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.190
 Average temperature is the healthiest there is 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.590
 the 180 centigrade we are ready 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.140
 peanut bar fine nothing but good 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.940
 mix we have lowered the mixture 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.940
 perfectly fine from the walls 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:57.610
 we are not ready now we are going to 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.110
 add flour and cocoa and powder 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.570
 to bake and the pinch of salt that we put 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.810
 everything together and I will add it in 3 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.830
 additions 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.830
 but be low 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.240
 I'm going to alternate with the bochum and ok 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.639
 and this is going to be 22 we can see you 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.790
 asked to see if you see please how is 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.480
 cut there we know how the rennet is 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.480
 there is the rennet 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.980
 the truth 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.960
 the second vision of my dry powders 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.820
 It is a very rich park for the kids 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.370
 I love how you are going to create the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.420
 rennet 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.690
 there is a little 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.690
 and I will finally finish with flour 9 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.960
 the easiest and fastest 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:50.060
 we are fine thank you heart 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.509
 we are all theaters and I have a 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 previously greased and focused mold 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.190
 not floured we put coconut has 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.229
 placed exactly and I had the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.720
 caution to put a waxed paper 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.060
 and again came back in butter and in 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.080
 This place makes me easier to 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:12.280
 I get my cake ok ok let's go down 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.280
 mix 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.639
 I'm not over beating if you realize 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.759
 I'm doing it very fast and this is 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.250
 because it's a pancake does not need a 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.699
 about about beating we do not have to integrate 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.699
 too much air 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.390
 I have coconut and sugar to decorate and in 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.780
 this moment will add vanilla 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.780

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.090
 the mold to put in the mold 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.180
 as it has been seen going to work I'm going to 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.180
