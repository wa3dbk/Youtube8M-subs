other baking companies and the Twinkie

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.970 
other baking companies and the Twinkie
will<00:02:15.060> most<00:02:15.480> likely<00:02:15.720> come<00:02:16.050> back<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.680> same

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
will most likely come back with the same

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.910 
will most likely come back with the same
original<00:02:17.340> recipe<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.530> very<00:02:19.530> similar

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
original recipe and very similar

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.690 
original recipe and very similar
packaging<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> don't<00:02:21.180> think<00:02:21.360> Twinkies

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
packaging so I don't think Twinkies

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.009 
packaging so I don't think Twinkies
will<00:02:22.790> totally<00:02:23.680> go<00:02:24.680> away<00:02:25.190> forever<00:02:26.090> might<00:02:26.870> go

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
will totally go away forever might go

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.490 
will totally go away forever might go
away<00:02:27.110> for<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> few<00:02:27.680> months<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.310> then<00:02:28.730> come<00:02:29.180> back

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
away for a few months and then come back

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.160 
away for a few months and then come back
much<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.739> Halloween<00:02:31.580> movie<00:02:32.170> franchise

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170

Twinkies<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.400> new<00:02:40.670> beginning<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.110> most

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
Twinkies a new beginning that's the most

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.790 
Twinkies a new beginning that's the most
likely<00:02:43.510> possibility<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.930> i<00:02:44.959> see<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.709> of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
likely possibility that i see and one of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.750 
likely possibility that i see and one of
the<00:02:45.890> reasons<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.400> think<00:02:47.799> Twinkies<00:02:48.799> slotting

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
the reasons I think Twinkies slotting

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.699 
the reasons I think Twinkies slotting
feed<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.330> look<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.660> one<00:02:50.810> up<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.140> slot<00:02:51.380> EV<00:02:51.680> I

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
feed and look that one up the slot EV I

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.729 
feed and look that one up the slot EV I
think<00:02:52.010> that's<00:02:52.190> already<00:02:52.459> been<00:02:52.670> paid<00:02:53.060> and

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
think that's already been paid and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.789 
think that's already been paid and
whatever<00:02:54.739> company<00:02:55.160> buys<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.910> Twinkies<00:02:56.330> brand

whatever company buys the Twinkies brand

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.140 
whatever company buys the Twinkies brand
probably<00:02:57.799> will<00:02:57.950> not<00:02:58.069> have<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.400> pay<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.580> slotting

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
probably will not have to pay a slotting
