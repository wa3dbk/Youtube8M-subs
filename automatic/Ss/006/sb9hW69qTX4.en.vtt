over<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.780> into<00:01:56.079> benchmarks<00:01:56.530> code<00:01:56.770> which<00:01:57.069> we

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
over the into benchmarks code which we

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.520 
over the into benchmarks code which we
have<00:01:57.399> got<00:01:57.609> for<00:01:57.819> this<00:01:57.969> device<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.509> again<00:01:59.079> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
have got for this device and again the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.410 
have got for this device and again the
in<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.740> do<00:01:59.829> benchmark<00:02:00.310> score<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.759> pretty<00:02:01.030> good

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
in to do benchmark score is pretty good

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.139 
in to do benchmark score is pretty good
on<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:01.749> device<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.889> is<00:02:03.039> right<00:02:03.249> now<00:02:03.460> not<00:02:04.119> a

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
on this device this is right now not a

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.749 
on this device this is right now not a
verified<00:02:04.659> score<00:02:04.929> but<00:02:05.259> even<00:02:05.799> if<00:02:05.920> even<00:02:06.579> if<00:02:06.670> I

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
verified score but even if even if I

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.120 
verified score but even if even if I
verify<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.329> this<00:02:07.990> will<00:02:08.229> be<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.679> will<00:02:08.860> remain

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
verify it this will be this will remain

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.030 
verify it this will be this will remain
the<00:02:09.280> same<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.240> 6<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.690> 7<00:02:10.720> 1<00:02:11.200> which<00:02:11.860> is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the same so it is for 6 to 7 1 which is

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.610 
the same so it is for 6 to 7 1 which is
to<00:02:12.280> score<00:02:12.850> which<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.390> got<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.840> n2<00:02:14.260> 2<00:02:14.380> for

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to score which we have got on n2 2 for

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.380 
to score which we have got on n2 2 for
this<00:02:14.770> device<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.459> device<00:02:15.520> definitely

this device and this device definitely

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.570 
this device and this device definitely
it's<00:02:16.930> pretty<00:02:17.230> good<00:02:17.440> in<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.130> particular

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
it's pretty good in that particular

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
device has 2gb of RAM so a billable

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.670 
device has 2gb of RAM so a billable
amount<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.540> RAM<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.870> also<00:02:48.140> pretty<00:02:48.290> good<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
amount of RAM is also pretty good and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the storage is also good enough you get

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.660 
the storage is also good enough you get
around<00:02:51.050> twenty<00:02:51.470> six<00:02:51.680> point<00:02:51.920> three<00:02:52.010> five<00:02:52.310> GB

available<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.330> user<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.840> again<00:02:54.470> because

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
available to the user and again because

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.740 
available to the user and again because
we<00:02:55.100> have<00:02:55.250> got<00:02:55.670> a<00:02:55.700> couple<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:56.000> application<00:02:56.570> that

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
we have got a couple of application that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.240 
we have got a couple of application that
is<00:02:56.930> why<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.110> available<00:02:57.650> amount<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:58.040> storage

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
is why the available amount of storage

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.460 
is why the available amount of storage
is<00:02:58.520> slightly<00:02:58.730> less<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.660> this<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.110> kind<00:03:00.290> of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
is slightly less but this is the kind of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.960 
is slightly less but this is the kind of
scenario<00:03:00.980> which<00:03:01.130> you<00:03:01.190> will<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.550> on<00:03:01.790> this

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
scenario which you will have on this

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.270 
scenario which you will have on this
device<00:03:02.300> these<00:03:02.870> are<00:03:03.020> all<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.290> senses<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.100> let's

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
device these are all the senses so let's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.740 
device these are all the senses so let's
take<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.580> look<00:03:04.760> over<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.000> scores<00:03:05.420> which<00:03:05.600> we

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
take a look over the scores which we

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.040 
take a look over the scores which we
have<00:03:05.930> caught<00:03:06.200> on<00:03:06.410> dynamic<00:03:06.920> now<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.050> online

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
have caught on dynamic now and online

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.570 
have caught on dynamic now and online
amok<00:03:09.260> we<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.620> got<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> score<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.160> fifty<00:03:10.550> eight

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
amok we have got a score of fifty eight

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.210 
amok we have got a score of fifty eight
point<00:03:10.940> nine<00:03:11.030> FPS<00:03:11.660> which<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.080> pretty<00:03:12.560> good<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
point nine FPS which is pretty good and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.250 
point nine FPS which is pretty good and
