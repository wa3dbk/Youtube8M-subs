little bit of moisture condensation in
this<00:00:24.990> camp<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> gasoline<00:00:27.449> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
this camp and actually the gasoline can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.679 
this camp and actually the gasoline can
actually<00:00:28.109> lose<00:00:28.410> its<00:00:28.740> potency<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:30.179> it's
