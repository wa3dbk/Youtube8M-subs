00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.430
 the rotations are also a 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.300
 Isometric transformation consisting 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.510
 in turning a figure around a point 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.880
 point 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.360
 around which this figure must turn 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.650
 has different possibilities for 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.590
 example can be 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.020
 a triangle that that point that's 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.020
 on a vertex can be 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 that point p could also be 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.680
 inside the triangle 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.910
 it could also be out of time 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.630
 depending on where this point is 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.300
 then the rotation will be different 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's not the same to rotate and here I have 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.770
 it's not the same to rotate for example if I 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.000
 I put my rotation point there he is 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.690
 in the piece in the rotating 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.690
 in that way 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.350
 it's not the same to make it rotate so I 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600
 I put the point in the center and do it 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 rotate there the rotation is going to be this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.090
 shape 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.950
 and the other thing is that I put the point out 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.860
 if I place the point for example in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.990
 this position 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.700
 and I want to rotate this figure that is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.240
 figure is going to rotate around here around 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.240
 that point 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.830
 well those are the possibilities of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.350
 rotation 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.570
 for that then always look very 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 well in the exercise where they locate that 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.540
 point around which will rotate this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 figure 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.390
 and the second thing to be always fixed 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.140
 is the magnitude the magnitude refers to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.680
 The usual measures are the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.980
 90 degrees 180 degrees but it also 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 You can obviously see other places 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.690
 according to the exercise you will not have to 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:14.180
 see what is the magnitude that will have to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.000
 apply and an important thing is the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.790
 I felt the direction of rotation the sense of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 rotation because this is according 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.299
 to the following 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.010
 and the movement that is made is in this 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.740
 sense 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.300
 there is talk of a movement 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:41.020
 positive or be a movement that is 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.840
 contrary to the hands of a clock 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.870
 while if the movement is in this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.130
 I sense how the hands of 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.490
 a clock we talk about a negative sense 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.900
 therefore one knows that if they tell me 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.260
 that you have to rotate at 45 degrees 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 the rotation is going to be in that sense that 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.930
 if they tell me to rotate at minus 90 degrees 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.140
 I know that the rotation is going to be in that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.170
 sense 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.910
 therefore look very well in the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.350
 number that are not giving the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.500
 indications to be able to do 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.500
 relationship the rotation in correct form
