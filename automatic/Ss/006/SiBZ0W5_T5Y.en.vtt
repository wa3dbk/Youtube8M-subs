00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 yes friends if you just this 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.430
 Abo box I get in the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.500
 moment in the stadium today darmstadt against 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.189
 schalke all the nothing with football on 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.440
 hat have 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 no offense is just a bonus video 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 I thought so if a few 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.660
 my subscribers are a bit 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.850
 No matter what 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.650
 which club depart today nothing 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.369
 may have better things to do from very 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.760
 20:15 the live broadcast in the area 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 look at 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.400
 darmstadt live primetime mrd so what can 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.539
 I do not even remember that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.289
 there was already time in my time 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.969
 not at all 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.160
 and they will not be that fast either 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.770
 so have more for the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
 ignorant Mr. darmstadt used to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 Oberliga then regional even now 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.020
 third league and in the dfb cup only 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.270
 gladbach cut out now switch 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.360
 for that you come live and play 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 Germany will see us and well me 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 have the video here of course before 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.280
 play recorded 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.739
 switch let it switch but free at 20 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.590
 maybe as a little reminder 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.300
 that you might be able to turn on 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.040
 starting in 2015 is at 20 o'clock 30 and yes 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 Of course you can in this video 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 say under the comments discuss 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 yes, the 18 for schalke and darfeld 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 the 12 to zero so we are clearer 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.080
 outsider that's very clear we are 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.799
 glad to be able to get that far 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.729
 and as long as we are not in Germany 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 now it is embarrassing with 40 defeat 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.540
 yes okay so no to 3 or 0 2 goes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.150
 simply 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 and if we beat each other like 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 will go out 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 you can do to you now again 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.370
 sorry to the people I first with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.260
 the teaser with the fifa forecast 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.290
 simulation now with the reminder that 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.940

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.260

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.240
 video here again on private 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.890
 it's just like with little memories like 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.890
 the people watching their live streams on 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.600
 prices so serious livestream and you can 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.130
 Turn on your TV not rtl 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.940
 look at an area 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.509
 there the darmstÃ¤dter run the holidays 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.160
 the third division against Schalke 04 and times 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.110
 see if we sell reasonably expensive 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.110
 I 'm here if you're lucky cd me 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:19.610
 yes, that was actually the principle 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.610
 already and until then
