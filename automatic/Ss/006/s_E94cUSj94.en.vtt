00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.540 
I actually like I add a little reverb
set<00:05:30.940> my<00:05:31.090> reverberation<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.110> 30

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
set my reverberation to 30

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.129 
set my reverberation to 30
high-frequency<00:05:33.550> damping<00:05:34.210> 250<00:05:34.630> stereo<00:05:34.990> width

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
high-frequency damping 250 stereo width

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.749 
high-frequency damping 250 stereo width
to<00:05:35.289> 100<00:05:35.740> wet<00:05:35.890> mix<00:05:36.130> 10<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.610> dry<00:05:36.789> mix<00:05:37.030> 100

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.239 

my<00:05:40.969> distortion<00:05:41.569> I<00:05:41.809> create<00:05:42.529> a<00:05:42.559> custom<00:05:43.069> preset

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249 
my distortion I create a custom preset

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.850 
my distortion I create a custom preset
where<00:05:43.759> my<00:05:43.849> pre<00:05:44.089> gain<00:05:44.270> is<00:05:44.419> at<00:05:44.539> 20<00:05:44.930> distortion<00:05:45.740> is

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
where my pre gain is at 20 distortion is

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.379 
where my pre gain is at 20 distortion is
at<00:05:45.949> 6<00:05:46.219> and<00:05:46.400> post<00:05:46.580> gain<00:05:46.759> is<00:05:46.879> at<00:05:46.999> 70<00:05:47.449> I<00:05:48.909> also<00:05:49.909> use

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
at 6 and post gain is at 70 I also use

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.739 
at 6 and post gain is at 70 I also use
the<00:05:50.870> punchy<00:05:51.319> mix<00:05:51.559> setting<00:05:52.370> on<00:05:52.520> classic<00:05:53.330> EQ

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
the punchy mix setting on classic EQ

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.249 
the punchy mix setting on classic EQ
this<00:05:54.559> is<00:05:54.770> under<00:05:55.219> the<00:05:55.370> classic<00:05:55.849> EQ<00:05:56.360> not<00:05:57.080> the

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
this is under the classic EQ not the

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.089 
this is under the classic EQ not the
acoustica<00:05:58.069> EQ<00:05:58.729> and<00:05:59.349> that's<00:06:00.349> pretty<00:06:00.680> much<00:06:00.860> it

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
acoustica EQ and that's pretty much it

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.499 
acoustica EQ and that's pretty much it
those<00:06:01.309> same<00:06:01.580> exact<00:06:01.939> settings<00:06:02.330> have<00:06:02.479> been

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
those same exact settings have been

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.239 
those same exact settings have been
applied<00:06:02.629> to<00:06:03.080> these<00:06:03.199> top<00:06:03.469> two<00:06:03.680> tracks<00:06:04.009> where<00:06:04.219> I

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:04.249
