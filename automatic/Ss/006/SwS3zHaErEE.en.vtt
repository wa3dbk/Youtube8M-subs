00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
circles out so now you have a front

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.200 
circles out so now you have a front
fabric<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.649> back<00:01:45.859> fabric<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.729> red<00:01:46.969> is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
fabric and a back fabric the red is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.969 
fabric and a back fabric the red is
going<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.479> be<00:01:47.569> our<00:01:47.689> front<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.649> green<00:01:48.889> is

going to be our front and the green is

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.249 
going to be our front and the green is
going<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.219> be<00:01:49.310> our<00:01:49.460> back<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:53.030> next<00:01:53.270> step<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:53.899> to

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259
