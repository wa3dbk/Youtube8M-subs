so<00:00:06.549> too

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
so too

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.250 
so too
scrape<00:00:07.900> using<00:00:08.260> the<00:00:08.350> existing<00:00:09.309> scrape<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:11.230> I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
scrape using the existing scrape what I

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.170 
scrape using the existing scrape what I
would<00:00:11.469> do<00:00:11.530> is<00:00:11.650> start<00:00:11.889> by<00:00:11.950> taking<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.549> top<00:00:12.790> 1/2

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
would do is start by taking the top 1/2

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.839 
would do is start by taking the top 1/2
inch<00:00:13.450> off<00:00:14.440> of<00:00:14.500> that<00:00:14.889> scrape<00:00:15.250> so<00:00:15.520> a<00:00:15.550> lot<00:00:15.760> of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
inch off of that scrape so a lot of

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.929 
inch off of that scrape so a lot of
times<00:00:16.029> a<00:00:16.240> buck<00:00:16.450> or<00:00:16.689> a<00:00:16.750> doe<00:00:17.430> will<00:00:18.430> mark<00:00:18.730> that

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
times a buck or a doe will mark that

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.120 
times a buck or a doe will mark that
scrape<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:19.570> that<00:00:20.410> buck<00:00:20.590> will<00:00:20.770> mark<00:00:20.980> that

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
scrape and that buck will mark that

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.499 
scrape and that buck will mark that
scrape<00:00:21.369> it'll<00:00:21.640> penetrate<00:00:21.790> a<00:00:22.119> little<00:00:22.420> bit

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
scrape it'll penetrate a little bit

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.089 
scrape it'll penetrate a little bit
deeper<00:00:22.720> but<00:00:23.020> just<00:00:23.230> taking<00:00:23.560> off<00:00:23.680> that<00:00:23.710> top

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
deeper but just taking off that top

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.609 
deeper but just taking off that top
half-inch<00:00:24.640> allows<00:00:25.390> that<00:00:25.630> scrape<00:00:26.020> to<00:00:26.320> kind<00:00:26.560> of

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
half-inch allows that scrape to kind of

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.010 
half-inch allows that scrape to kind of
stay<00:00:26.800> active<00:00:27.399> and<00:00:27.700> also<00:00:28.540> allows<00:00:28.779> you<00:00:28.989> to

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
stay active and also allows you to

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.740 
stay active and also allows you to
remove<00:00:29.439> some<00:00:29.829> of<00:00:29.860> that<00:00:30.070> dirt<00:00:30.790> for<00:00:31.480> your<00:00:31.630> own

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
remove some of that dirt for your own

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.530 
remove some of that dirt for your own
area<00:00:32.259> so<00:00:32.980> then<00:00:33.160> I<00:00:33.280> would<00:00:33.430> take<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:33.790> dirt<00:00:34.180> put

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
area so then I would take that dirt put

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.060 
area so then I would take that dirt put
it<00:00:34.660> into<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.930> bucket<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.440> I<00:00:35.500> might<00:00:35.739> collect

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
it into a bucket and I might collect

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.900 
it into a bucket and I might collect
samples<00:00:36.610> from<00:00:36.960> 7<00:00:37.960> or<00:00:38.050> 8<00:00:38.170> different<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.790> know

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
samples from 7 or 8 different you know

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
samples from 7 or 8 different you know
buck<00:00:40.810> made<00:00:41.080> scrapes<00:00:41.530> take<00:00:42.490> that<00:00:42.670> dirt<00:00:42.940> move<00:00:43.750> it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
buck made scrapes take that dirt move it

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.920 
buck made scrapes take that dirt move it
over<00:00:44.230> into<00:00:44.440> an<00:00:44.950> area<00:00:45.340> clean<00:00:46.150> off<00:00:46.360> an<00:00:46.510> area<00:00:46.690> and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
over into an area clean off an area and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.230 
over into an area clean off an area and
I<00:00:46.990> use<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.170> tool<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:48.220> has<00:00:48.430> three<00:00:48.760> prongs<00:00:49.000> on

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
I use a tool that has three prongs on

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.880 
I use a tool that has three prongs on
one<00:00:49.420> side<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.900> a<00:00:49.960> flat<00:00:50.260> side<00:00:50.500> on<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:50.860> other

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
one side and a flat side on the other

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.700 
one side and a flat side on the other
and<00:00:51.340> it's<00:00:52.210> just<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.540> general<00:00:52.960> landscaping<00:00:53.530> tool

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
and it's just a general landscaping tool

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.569 
and it's just a general landscaping tool
so<00:00:54.430> then<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:54.790> would<00:00:54.850> clean<00:00:55.150> out<00:00:55.180> my<00:00:55.630> scrape<00:00:56.579> then

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
so then I would clean out my scrape then

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.040 
so then I would clean out my scrape then
I<00:00:57.670> would<00:00:57.790> take<00:00:57.940> dirt<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:59.320> in<00:00:59.610> now<00:01:00.610> maybe<00:01:01.050> three

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
I would take dirt put in now maybe three

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.969 
I would take dirt put in now maybe three
or<00:01:02.140> four<00:01:02.200> scoop<00:01:02.650> fulls<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:03.370> natural<00:01:04.360> dirt

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
or four scoop fulls of that natural dirt

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.170 
or four scoop fulls of that natural dirt
that<00:01:05.979> would<00:01:06.430> come<00:01:06.700> from<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.970> screen<00:01:07.240> then

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that would come from the screen then

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.300 
that would come from the screen then
then<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.270> would<00:01:10.479> take<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.409> trail<00:01:11.740> camera<00:01:12.010> hanging

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
then I would take a trail camera hanging

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.080 
then I would take a trail camera hanging
that<00:01:12.580> area<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.830> what's<00:01:15.040> going<00:01:15.340> on<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
that area see what's going on on the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.760 
that area see what's going on on the
Licking<00:01:16.420> branch<00:01:16.690> what<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:16.960> would<00:01:17.200> do<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.560> I

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
Licking branch what I would do is I

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.210 
Licking branch what I would do is I
would<00:01:18.130> find<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.090> good-looking<00:01:19.600> branch<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:21.040> I

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
would find a good-looking branch if I

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.830 
would find a good-looking branch if I
hang<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> camera<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:21.940> a<00:01:22.000> natural<00:01:22.270> scrape

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
hang a camera on a natural scrape

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.460 
hang a camera on a natural scrape
finding<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:23.890> they're<00:01:24.340> really<00:01:24.640> hit<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:24.909> hard

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
finding that they're really hit it hard

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.990 
finding that they're really hit it hard
and<00:01:26.470> then<00:01:27.040> all<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.280> sudden<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:27.580> kind<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.820> goes

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
and then all of a sudden it kind of goes

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.510 
and then all of a sudden it kind of goes
cold<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.659> would<00:01:29.560> take<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.860> licker<00:01:30.100> branch<00:01:30.370> I

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
cold I would take that licker branch I

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.510 
cold I would take that licker branch I
would<00:01:30.640> cut<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:31.030> into<00:01:31.299> an<00:01:31.510> area<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:32.530> would<00:01:33.310> cut

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
would cut it into an area I would cut

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.600 
would cut it into an area I would cut
the<00:01:33.670> branch<00:01:33.909> first<00:01:34.180> put<00:01:34.960> on<00:01:34.990> rubber<00:01:35.200> gloves

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
the branch first put on rubber gloves

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.020 
the branch first put on rubber gloves
move<00:01:36.610> it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
move it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.550 
move it
you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.570> as<00:01:37.750> soon<00:01:37.930> as<00:01:38.020> possible<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.440> go

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
you know as soon as possible I go

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.310 
you know as soon as possible I go
straight<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.190> my<00:01:39.310> other<00:01:39.490> area<00:01:39.970> use<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:40.990> zip

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
straight to in my other area use a zip

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.539 
straight to in my other area use a zip
tie<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:43.119> hang<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.450> you<00:01:43.750> know<00:01:43.869> I've<00:01:44.020> used

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
tie and then hang it you know I've used

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.980 
tie and then hang it you know I've used
take<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.580> licking<00:01:46.180> branch<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.630> natural

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
take a licking branch the natural

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.130 
take a licking branch the natural
looking<00:01:47.229> branch<00:01:47.500> cut<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.010> move<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.140> side

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
looking branch cut it move it to a side

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.859 
looking branch cut it move it to a side
of<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.380> fence<00:01:50.560> post<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:52.390> way<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.600> have<00:01:52.840> a

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
of a fence post and that way I have a

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.230 
of a fence post and that way I have a
spot<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.290> hang<00:01:53.439> my<00:01:53.560> camera<00:01:54.010> in<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.640> spot<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.060> hang

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
spot to hang my camera in a spot to hang

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.240 
spot to hang my camera in a spot to hang
my<00:01:55.420> licking<00:01:56.140> branch<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.740> difference<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.220> think

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
my licking branch the difference I think

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.170 
my licking branch the difference I think
in<00:01:57.960> use<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:58.990> natural<00:01:59.290> dirt<00:01:59.710> where<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:01.090> know

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
in use a natural dirt where you know

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.000 
in use a natural dirt where you know
bucks<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.840> those<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.229> marked<00:02:02.470> our<00:02:02.619> areas
