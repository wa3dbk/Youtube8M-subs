00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.599
 health is a place where you can 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.429
 come to start I want to bring products 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.469
 where really a person can 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.240
 nurture in a much more natural way 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.970
 at the end so much freer 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.630
 gluten 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.980
 of casein from so many foods that 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.980
 we are used to consume 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.240
 the thread is measured extract all the more 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 possible organic from the villas to 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.480
 the green vegetable vegetables fruits and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.970
 including meat also 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 and really the healthy organization is 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.500
 much more basic is much more ancestral 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 it is much more than what they consumed 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.989
 our grandparents or our ancestors of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.970
 what they cultivated properly from 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 there comes this proposal is to say 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.920
 let's go back to the field let's go back to the natural 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.920
 and let's start feeding again something 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.970
 you have a very good source of protein 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.130
 wheat barley rye and oats in 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 these four cereals we found the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
 gluten this gluten 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.110
 some people extract it to do 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.140
 the tnte or gluten as such and what 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.869
 consume as one as a meat what 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.900
 come back they give it a meaty texture 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.869
 but other people can not consume 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.240
 this type of food because in the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.420
 small intestine that regulates and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.729
 who sends all the all the nutrients 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.100
 into the bloodstream there is generated a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.149
 allergy when the consumption of gluten as 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.149
 celia wanted 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.100
 once this happens there are some effects 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 strong almost always is the inflammation 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 of the abdomen where we thought it was a 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.000
 seasoning or we blame the paprika 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.490
 or the garlic and basically the bread that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.549
 we consume ourselves before we start 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.429
 consuming the soup is an allergy that does not 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.049
 has one that has no cure that heals 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.530
 basically the change of habits 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.530
 food 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.099
 then here we personalize and we have 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.069
 a very broad proposal we have 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.230
 recipe proposal we advise the 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.269
 client, we need workshops, we say 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.370
 how to prepare a dish like the one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.590
 would feed very well how to nurture you and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.840
 very well from breakfast to 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 a meal that really replaces 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.739
 a bread that we believe can be integral 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.989
 that comes to us many times on the street 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.940
 very commercial and that's why we want to do 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.010
 I feel the craft breads with a lot 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.200
 consciousness of what this bread and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.450
 It can be vegan or it can be gluten free 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 or it can be without candy or according to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.980
 the punctual need of each person 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.040
 reading the label is very important 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.870
 that contains each food and between 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.180
 that almost everyone says food without 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.349
 gluten we have for pastry we have 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.000
 chocolates cookies many cereals 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.880
 we have rice pasta we have lack of 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.340
 quinoa we have corn paste we can 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.040
 perfectly replace gluten with 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.439
 other cereals 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.969
 always find an answer from this 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.040
 type of stores you will find 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.409
 information also on how to prepare them 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.150
 of how to do them because it is very is very 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.769
 easy when I'm eating we have a 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.209
 chickpea flour on flour 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.459
 quilmes but what do I do with it in my 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.530
 house so I'm going to do with it 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.239
 then from there I start too 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.370
 to let people learn to do 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.640
 easy food meal practice food 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.159
 fast and maybe food without kitchens without 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.120
