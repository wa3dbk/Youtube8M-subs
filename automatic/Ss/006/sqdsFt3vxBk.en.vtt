all<00:00:07.919> right<00:00:08.040> basically<00:00:08.219> here<00:00:08.550> we<00:00:08.670> are<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.910> your

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
all right basically here we are in your

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.299 
all right basically here we are in your
living<00:00:09.330> room<00:00:09.680> and<00:00:10.680> we're<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.070> tell<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
living room and we're here to tell you

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.690 
living room and we're here to tell you
about<00:00:11.490> how<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.059> learn<00:00:12.420> about<00:00:12.690> throttle

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
about how we learn about throttle

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.540 
about how we learn about throttle
the<00:00:14.090> balance<00:00:14.420> point<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:14.990> most<00:00:15.980> importantly

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
the balance point and most importantly

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.070 
the balance point and most importantly
his<00:00:16.670> engine<00:00:16.970> braking<00:00:17.180> let's<00:00:17.539> talk<00:00:17.720> about<00:00:17.869> the

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
his engine braking let's talk about the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.210 
his engine braking let's talk about the
balance<00:00:18.380> point<00:00:18.560> that's<00:00:18.740> probably<00:00:18.980> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
balance point that's probably the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.130 
balance point that's probably the
hardest<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.640> find<00:00:19.820> basically<00:00:20.270> what<00:00:20.990> I<00:00:21.020> would

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
hardest to find basically what I would

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.660 
hardest to find basically what I would
do<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.619> I<00:00:21.740> just<00:00:21.770> did<00:00:22.070> wheelie<00:00:22.310> after<00:00:22.520> really

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
do is I just did wheelie after really

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.700 
do is I just did wheelie after really
after<00:00:22.880> wheelie<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:23.419> I<00:00:23.480> learned<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.500> higher<00:00:24.680> I

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
after wheelie and I learned the higher I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.530 
after wheelie and I learned the higher I
would<00:00:25.009> get<00:00:25.160> my<00:00:25.279> wheel<00:00:25.490> up<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.970> closer<00:00:26.210> I<00:00:26.390> was

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
would get my wheel up the closer I was

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.909 
would get my wheel up the closer I was
in<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.720> balance<00:00:26.930> point<00:00:27.290> well<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.529> closer<00:00:27.770> I

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
in the balance point well the closer I

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:28.960 
in the balance point well the closer I
was<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.250> balance<00:00:28.430> point

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
was the balance point

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.220 
was the balance point
the<00:00:29.300> longer<00:00:29.599> I<00:00:29.630> would<00:00:29.869> go<00:00:29.989> with<00:00:30.110> that

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
the longer I would go with that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.870 
the longer I would go with that
acceleration<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.070> eventually<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:31.579> I<00:00:31.610> found

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
acceleration and eventually when I found

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.250 
acceleration and eventually when I found
the<00:00:32.029> balance<00:00:32.180> point<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:32.720> was<00:00:32.809> like<00:00:32.840> dude<00:00:33.200> you

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
the balance point it was like dude you

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.900 
the balance point it was like dude you
could<00:00:33.410> go<00:00:33.500> forever<00:00:33.710> I<00:00:34.100> mean<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.760> doesn't

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
could go forever I mean it doesn't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.280 
could go forever I mean it doesn't
matter<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:35.210> can<00:00:35.270> go<00:00:35.360> 30<00:00:35.660> miles<00:00:35.899> till<00:00:36.140> you<00:00:36.200> run

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
matter you can go 30 miles till you run

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.959 
matter you can go 30 miles till you run
out<00:00:36.440> of<00:00:36.500> gas<00:00:36.559> whatever<00:00:36.980> first<00:00:37.399> gear<00:00:37.640> makes<00:00:37.880> a

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
out of gas whatever first gear makes a

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.910 
out of gas whatever first gear makes a
difference<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:39.140> balance<00:00:39.290> point<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.739> hard

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
difference so the balance point is hard

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.860 
difference so the balance point is hard
to<00:00:40.040> find<00:00:40.190> it's<00:00:40.399> basically<00:00:40.730> like<00:00:40.940> a<00:00:41.210> lot<00:00:41.840> of

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
to find it's basically like a lot of

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.150 
to find it's basically like a lot of
people<00:00:42.020> think<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.530> get<00:00:42.649> to<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.829> balance

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
people think that you get to the balance

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.410 
people think that you get to the balance
point<00:00:43.340> you're<00:00:43.489> just<00:00:43.520> gonna<00:00:43.700> flip<00:00:44.030> like<00:00:44.300> they

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
point you're just gonna flip like they

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.639 
point you're just gonna flip like they
think<00:00:44.660> that<00:00:44.719> there's<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.020> like<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.320> light<00:00:45.530> switch

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
think that there's a like a light switch

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.010 
think that there's a like a light switch
a<00:00:45.830> balance<00:00:46.160> point<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:46.730> uhm<00:00:47.000> dumb<00:00:47.690> diet

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
a balance point and then uhm dumb diet

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.170 
a balance point and then uhm dumb diet
you<00:00:48.230> know<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:48.620> basically<00:00:48.830> it's<00:00:49.790> like<00:00:50.000> this

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
you know but basically it's like this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.490 
you know but basically it's like this
you<00:00:50.780> won't<00:00:50.960> really<00:00:51.050> know<00:00:51.200> what<00:00:51.320> it's<00:00:51.440> like

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
you won't really know what it's like

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.890 
you won't really know what it's like
until<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:51.950> get<00:00:52.130> there<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.550> it's<00:00:53.510> actually

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
until you get there and it's actually

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.660 
until you get there and it's actually
manageable<00:00:54.380> it's<00:00:54.560> deal<00:00:54.740> well<00:00:55.010> it's<00:00:55.190> nice<00:00:55.400> it's

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
manageable it's deal well it's nice it's

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.980 
manageable it's deal well it's nice it's
it's<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.940> cool<00:00:56.120> feeling<00:00:56.390> because<00:00:56.720> you're<00:00:56.840> in

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's a cool feeling because you're in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.970 
it's a cool feeling because you're in
your<00:00:57.110> wheelie<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.590> feel<00:00:57.770> this<00:00:57.829> weird

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
your wheelie and you feel this weird

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.350 
your wheelie and you feel this weird
acceleration<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:58.850> then<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.060> kinda<00:00:59.270> like

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
acceleration and then it's kinda like

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.479 
acceleration and then it's kinda like
it's<00:00:59.540> neutral<00:00:59.989> right<00:01:00.200> right<00:01:00.530> one<00:01:00.920> celery<00:01:01.280> once

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
it's neutral right right one celery once

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.069 
it's neutral right right one celery once
you're<00:01:01.640> accelerating<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.210> really<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.660> lot<00:01:02.960> of

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
you're accelerating you really a lot of

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.509 
you're accelerating you really a lot of
the<00:01:03.140> pressures<00:01:03.530> put<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.129> palms<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.460> your

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the pressures put in the palms of your

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.429 
the pressures put in the palms of your
hands<00:01:04.759> to<00:01:04.970> hold<00:01:05.089> your<00:01:05.269> bike<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:05.630> once<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.290> get

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
hands to hold your bike and once you get

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.020 
hands to hold your bike and once you get
closer<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> balance<00:01:07.310> point<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:07.850> almost

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
closer to a balance point it's almost

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.389 
closer to a balance point it's almost
like<00:01:08.299> it<00:01:08.840> puts<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.380> pressure<00:01:09.590> on<00:01:09.950> your<00:01:10.189> on

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
like it puts the pressure on your on

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:12.039 
like it puts the pressure on your on
your<00:01:10.670> body<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.240> takes<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.600> lot<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.780> pressure

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
your body and it takes a lot of pressure

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.179 
your body and it takes a lot of pressure
off<00:01:12.229> your<00:01:12.439> wrist<00:01:12.649> that's<00:01:12.860> when<00:01:13.009> you<00:01:13.070> know

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
off your wrist that's when you know

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.260 
off your wrist that's when you know
you're<00:01:13.310> getting<00:01:13.520> close<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:13.970> balance

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
you're getting close to the balance

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.880 
you're getting close to the balance
point<00:01:14.479> that's<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.750> tell<00:01:14.990> people<00:01:15.140> yeah<00:01:15.649> no

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
point that's what I tell people yeah no

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.499 
point that's what I tell people yeah no
that's<00:01:15.979> good<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:16.549> definitely<00:01:17.090> true<00:01:17.210> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
that's good that's definitely true and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.359 
that's good that's definitely true and
the<00:01:17.929> thing<00:01:18.109> is<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.380> closer<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.130> the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the thing is the closer you are the

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.950 
the thing is the closer you are the
balance<00:01:19.609> point<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.969> longest<00:01:20.329> longer<00:01:20.749> I<00:01:20.810> would

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
balance point the longest longer I would

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.539 
balance point the longest longer I would
always<00:01:21.109> ride<00:01:21.499> my<00:01:21.679> wheelies<00:01:22.009> every<00:01:22.249> time<00:01:22.429> you

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
always ride my wheelies every time you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.949 
don't really have a whole lot to bring
me<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.360> position<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:41.040> do<00:02:41.490> have

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
me back to position but I do have

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.300 
me back to position but I do have
throttle<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.260> bring<00:02:43.440> me<00:02:43.560> back<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.950> balance

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
throttle to bring me back to the balance

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.790 
throttle to bring me back to the balance
point<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.030> I'm<00:02:45.420> smooth<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> throttle<00:02:46.230> till

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
point so I'm smooth on the throttle till

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.290 
point so I'm smooth on the throttle till
I<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:46.950> back<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> balance<00:02:47.760> point<00:02:47.940> once<00:02:48.150> I'm

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
I get back to the balance point once I'm

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.910 
I get back to the balance point once I'm
here<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.840> staying<00:02:49.050> pretty<00:02:49.319> consistent<00:02:49.830> on

here I'm staying pretty consistent on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.199 
here I'm staying pretty consistent on
the<00:02:50.010> throttle<00:02:50.310> I'm<00:02:50.370> not<00:02:50.520> doing<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.940> whole<00:02:51.060> lot

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the throttle I'm not doing a whole lot

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.840 
the throttle I'm not doing a whole lot
of<00:02:51.420> changes<00:02:51.720> here<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.989> right<00:02:52.110> hand

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
saying about being jerky like I wouldn't

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.140 
saying about being jerky like I wouldn't
be<00:03:45.959> balancing<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.250> like<00:03:47.400> expect

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
be balancing here and it's like expect

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.729 
be balancing here and it's like expect
to<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.360> jerky<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:48.810> everything<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.440> want<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
to be jerky like everything if I want to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.680 
to be jerky like everything if I want to
bounce<00:03:50.459> forward<00:03:50.730> or<00:03:50.910> backwards<00:03:51.360> everything's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
bounce forward or backwards everything's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.449 
bounce forward or backwards everything's
got<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.870> be<00:03:51.959> smooth<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> same<00:03:53.220> kind<00:03:53.430> of

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
got to be smooth it's the same kind of

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.890 
got to be smooth it's the same kind of
thing<00:03:53.579> on<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.730> bike<00:03:53.850> it's<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> good<00:03:54.299> that's<00:03:54.780> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
thing on the bike it's a good that's a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.380 
thing on the bike it's a good that's a
good<00:03:54.930> theory<00:03:55.350> there<00:03:55.760> yeah<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.000> basically<00:03:57.120> I

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
good theory there yeah so basically I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.849 
good theory there yeah so basically I
mean<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.989> pretty<00:03:58.140> simple<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> cool

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
mean it's pretty simple it's a cool

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.080 
mean it's pretty simple it's a cool
concept<00:03:59.070> that<00:03:59.430> no<00:03:59.579> one<00:03:59.670> really<00:03:59.850> showed<00:04:00.060> me

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
concept that no one really showed me

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.449 
concept that no one really showed me
before<00:04:00.510> it's<00:04:01.079> basically<00:04:01.829> I'm<00:04:01.950> going<00:04:02.220> up<00:04:02.340> I'm

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
before it's basically I'm going up I'm

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.250 
before it's basically I'm going up I'm
on<00:04:02.640> my<00:04:02.760> gas<00:04:03.000> I'm<00:04:03.239> on<00:04:03.359> my<00:04:03.480> throttle<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.049> then<00:04:04.170> I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
on my gas I'm on my throttle and then I

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.050 
on my gas I'm on my throttle and then I
do<00:04:04.320> my<00:04:04.440> engine<00:04:04.829> brake<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.160> brings<00:04:05.340> me<00:04:05.430> down<00:04:05.640> I'm

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
do my engine brake it brings me down I'm

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.699 
do my engine brake it brings me down I'm
gassing<00:04:06.570> I'm<00:04:06.690> nice<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.019> smooth<00:04:07.260> they<00:04:07.440> get<00:04:07.590> to

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
gassing I'm nice and smooth they get to

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.590 
gassing I'm nice and smooth they get to
my<00:04:07.829> point<00:04:08.130> I'm<00:04:08.609> at<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> balance<00:04:09.180> point<00:04:09.450> I'm

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
my point I'm at the balance point I'm

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.210 
my point I'm at the balance point I'm
fine<00:04:09.780> then<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.109> go<00:04:10.230> too<00:04:10.380> far<00:04:10.620> engine<00:04:10.980> braking

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
fine then I go too far engine braking

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.800 
fine then I go too far engine braking
but<00:04:11.430> notice<00:04:11.700> notice<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.299> movement<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.750> he

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
but notice notice the movement that he

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.449 
but notice notice the movement that he
has<00:04:12.959> there<00:04:13.140> if<00:04:13.230> he's<00:04:13.410> really<00:04:13.650> abrupt<00:04:14.100> she's

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
has there if he's really abrupt she's

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.979 
has there if he's really abrupt she's
gonna<00:04:14.579> bring<00:04:14.850> himself<00:04:15.030> down<00:04:15.420> forward<00:04:15.900> and

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
gonna bring himself down forward and

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.330 
gonna bring himself down forward and
he's<00:04:16.079> gonna<00:04:16.200> actually<00:04:16.440> have<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.919> use<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.070> lot

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
he's gonna actually have to use a lot

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.560 
he's gonna actually have to use a lot
more<00:04:17.489> force<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.820> bring<00:04:18.120> him<00:04:18.209> back<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.390> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
more force to bring him back to the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.420 
more force to bring him back to the
balance<00:04:18.840> point<00:04:19.049> if<00:04:19.350> he<00:04:19.530> brings<00:04:19.799> himself<00:04:19.979> back

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
balance point if he brings himself back

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.790 
balance point if he brings himself back
slowly<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.900> where<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.229> can<00:04:22.350> find<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> balance

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
slowly to where you can find the balance

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.330 
slowly to where you can find the balance
point

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
point

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.120 
point
the<00:04:23.700> throttle<00:04:24.330> input<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.960> very<00:04:25.320> minimal<00:04:25.770> in

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
the throttle input is very minimal in

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.860 
the throttle input is very minimal in
keeping<00:04:26.400> really<00:04:26.610> smooth<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.480> let's<00:04:27.660> show<00:04:27.810> them

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
keeping really smooth so let's show them

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.240 
keeping really smooth so let's show them
how<00:04:27.930> smooth<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.470> keep<00:04:28.680> this<00:04:34.250> survival

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
how smooth you can keep this survival

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.790
