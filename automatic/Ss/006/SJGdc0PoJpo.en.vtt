as well so I'm guessing he's gonna win
this<00:05:02.330> time<00:05:02.599> as<00:05:02.780> well<00:05:02.889> of<00:05:03.889> course<00:05:04.340> because

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
this time as well of course because

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.370 
this time as well of course because
that's<00:05:04.940> how<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.180> works<00:05:05.449> one<00:05:05.780> person<00:05:06.199> leaves

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
that's how it works one person leaves

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.469 
that's how it works one person leaves
the<00:05:06.500> lobby<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:07.310> everyone<00:05:07.849> else<00:05:07.970> has<00:05:08.120> to<00:05:08.270> leave

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
the lobby and everyone else has to leave

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.860 
the lobby and everyone else has to leave
to<00:05:08.870> have<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.050> chance<00:05:09.289> of<00:05:09.440> winning<00:05:09.500> in<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.310> game

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
to have a chance of winning in the game

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.510 
to have a chance of winning in the game
ok<00:05:11.870> usually<00:05:12.650> I'm<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.770> one<00:05:12.889> who's<00:05:13.099> winning<00:05:13.370> up

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
ok usually I'm the one who's winning up

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.460
