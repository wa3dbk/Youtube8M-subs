00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
inside of a building right now so it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.550 
inside of a building right now so it
might<00:04:53.790> not<00:04:53.910> lock<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.330> as<00:04:54.540> fast<00:04:54.840> or<00:04:55.020> as<00:04:55.080> much<00:04:55.350> as

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
might not lock on as fast or as much as

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.830 
might not lock on as fast or as much as
it<00:04:55.980> would<00:04:56.100> out<00:04:56.250> under<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> bear<00:04:57.180> sky<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:57.720> i<00:04:57.750> do

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
off of the new VR BLK 3 baseband I did

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.600

choose<00:05:25.290> this<00:05:25.500> wallpaper<00:05:26.010> because<00:05:26.370> in<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.580> lot

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.130 
choose this wallpaper because in a lot
of<00:05:26.790> places<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.390> country<00:05:27.540> there's<00:05:27.900> snow

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
including in my house and so I figured a

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.870 
including in my house and so I figured a
nice<00:05:31.200> warm<00:05:31.500> tropical<00:05:31.800> wallpaper<00:05:32.400> might<00:05:32.669> warm

you up while you're watching my videos

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.250 
you up while you're watching my videos
so<00:05:34.110> you<00:05:35.100> do<00:05:35.250> have<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.460> samsung<00:05:35.970> galaxy<00:05:36.210> note<00:05:37.020> 2

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
so you do have the samsung galaxy note 2

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.430 
so you do have the samsung galaxy note 2
camera<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.950> gallery<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.790> also<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.870> 4.2

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440

camera<00:05:40.950> and<00:05:41.100> gallery<00:05:41.250> now<00:05:41.640> I'm<00:05:42.000> not<00:05:42.210> sure<00:05:42.240> if

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
camera and gallery now I'm not sure if

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.540 
camera and gallery now I'm not sure if
that's<00:05:42.660> included<00:05:43.260> it<00:05:43.410> was<00:05:44.160> there<00:05:44.370> when<00:05:44.520> i

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
that's included it was there when i

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.850 
that's included it was there when i
booted<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.030> up<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.780> normally<00:05:46.320> flash<00:05:46.590> it<00:05:46.770> in

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
booted it up but I normally flash it in

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.620 
booted it up but I normally flash it in
my<00:05:46.980> rom<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.520> could<00:05:47.700> be<00:05:47.730> just<00:05:47.910> left<00:05:48.150> over<00:05:48.480> I

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
my rom so it could be just left over I

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.380 
my rom so it could be just left over I
did<00:05:49.140> do<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.290> full<00:05:49.590> wipe<00:05:49.740> I<00:05:50.010> wiped<00:05:50.430> everything<00:05:50.760> so

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
did do a full wipe I wiped everything so

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.510 
did do a full wipe I wiped everything so
chances<00:05:52.320> are<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.590> probably<00:05:52.620> was<00:05:53.040> included<00:05:53.460> in

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
chances are it probably was included in

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.670 
chances are it probably was included in
the<00:05:53.640> ROM<00:05:53.790> so<00:05:54.030> you<00:05:54.390> get<00:05:54.600> both<00:05:54.780> of<00:05:55.020> those<00:05:55.110> cameras

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
the ROM so you get both of those cameras

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.940 
the ROM so you get both of those cameras
