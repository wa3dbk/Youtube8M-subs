00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
blue button you push that you get a

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.580 
blue button you push that you get a
turbo<00:02:34.160> up<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.610> then<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.410> detective<00:02:36.410> rails

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
turbo up here then the detective rails

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.830 
turbo up here then the detective rails
push<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.700> hill<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.540> hit<00:02:38.629> this

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
push you up the hill and if you hit this

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.339 
push you up the hill and if you hit this
red<00:02:39.079> button<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.980> actually<00:02:40.160> sent<00:02:40.579> out<00:02:40.730> arrows

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
red button you actually sent out arrows

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.229 
red button you actually sent out arrows
which<00:02:42.349> you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:42.680> them<00:02:43.010> doing<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.370> there<00:02:43.609> to

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
which you can see them doing it there to

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.090 
which you can see them doing it there to
your<00:02:44.389> opponent<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.560> about<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.859> be<00:02:45.950> on

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
your opponent but this is about to be on

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.220 
your opponent but this is about to be on
a<00:02:47.560> repeater<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:48.950> shoots<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.250> lot<00:02:49.400> faster<00:02:49.880> and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
a repeater so it shoots a lot faster and

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.059 
a repeater so it shoots a lot faster and
actually<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.260> think<00:02:51.410> we're<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.680> replace

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
actually I think we're going to replace

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.530 
actually I think we're going to replace
this<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.549> said<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:52.880> just<00:02:52.910> wired<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.450> up

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
this like I said we just wired it up

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.479 
this like I said we just wired it up
today<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.079> lot<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.440> stuff<00:02:54.739> has<00:02:54.920> found<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
today so a lot of stuff has found the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.740 
today so a lot of stuff has found the
chained<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:55.940> haven't<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.209> started<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
chained we haven't you started the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.100 
chained we haven't you started the
design<00:02:57.079> process<00:02:57.319> yet<00:02:58.900> oops

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.400 

so<00:03:03.740> we<00:03:03.830> have<00:03:03.950> anything<00:03:04.130> decided<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.670> star

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
so we have anything decided the star

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.970 
so we have anything decided the star
decided<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.890> design<00:03:07.460> process<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.650> anyone

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
decided the design process so if anyone

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.040 
decided the design process so if anyone
wants<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.340> try<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.610> design<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.390> beast<00:03:11.660> with

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
wants to try to design this beast with

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.980 
wants to try to design this beast with
me<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:12.590> would<00:03:12.710> be<00:03:12.770> awesome<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.870> moving<00:03:14.870> on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
me that would be awesome but moving on

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.560 
me that would be awesome but moving on
so<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.310> got<00:03:16.490> another<00:03:16.820> button<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.420> hit

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
so here you got another button you hit

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.720 
so here you got another button you hit
this<00:03:17.750> button<00:03:17.960> you<00:03:18.410> go<00:03:18.590> down<00:03:18.860> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.310> Pistons

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
this button you go down and then Pistons

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.340 
this button you go down and then Pistons
actually<00:03:20.060> push<00:03:20.270> you<00:03:20.420> onto<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:20.780> track<00:03:21.080> and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
actually push you onto this track and

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.010 
actually push you onto this track and
then<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.590> shoot<00:03:21.800> away<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.850> miss<00:03:23.060> well<00:03:23.810> you

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
then you shoot away if you miss well you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.430 
then you shoot away if you miss well you
end<00:03:24.110> up<00:03:24.320> down<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.850> go

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
end up down here and then you have to go

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.370 
end up down here and then you have to go
up<00:03:27.440> here<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.510> end<00:03:29.690> up<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:30.020> over

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
up here and then you end up out over

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.520 
up here and then you end up out over
here<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:32.300> so<00:03:32.630> basically<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.170> takes<00:03:33.410> a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
here and then so basically just takes a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.380 
here and then so basically just takes a
little<00:03:33.709> longer<00:03:34.010> every<00:03:34.580> time<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.940> miss<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.150> blue

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
little longer every time you miss a blue

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.210 
little longer every time you miss a blue
button<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.500> all<00:03:36.620> right<00:03:36.740> so<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.010> get

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
button but it's all right so you get

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.580 
button but it's all right so you get
that<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:37.640> well<00:03:38.300> then<00:03:38.630> once<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.050> hit<00:03:39.170> this<00:03:39.350> one

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
that one well then once you hit this one

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.790 
that one well then once you hit this one
the<00:03:39.980> track<00:03:40.280> flips<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.390> then<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:42.350> end<00:03:42.680> up

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
the track flips and then you end up

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.550 
the track flips and then you end up
going<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.880> go<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.360> hit<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.660> boost<00:03:44.959> then

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
going in you go you hit that boost then

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.410 
going in you go you hit that boost then
you<00:03:45.680> go<00:03:45.770> here<00:03:45.950> here's<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.520> little<00:03:46.940> gladiator

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
you go here here's a little gladiator

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.390 
you go here here's a little gladiator
style<00:03:47.570> for<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.470> each<00:03:52.100> opponent

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
style for you you you each opponent

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.280 
style for you you you each opponent
starts<00:03:52.670> off<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:53.060> this<00:03:53.209> booster<00:03:53.570> track<00:03:53.840> they

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
starts off with this booster track they

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.110 
starts off with this booster track they
automatically<00:03:54.890> get<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:55.310> booster<00:03:55.640> track<00:03:55.940> up

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
automatically get this booster track up

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.310 
automatically get this booster track up
here<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:57.110> however<00:03:57.500> if<00:03:58.040> your<00:03:58.940> opponent<00:03:59.320> hits

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
here but however if your opponent hits

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.990 
here but however if your opponent hits
this<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:04.280> actually<00:04:04.730> lose<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.700> little

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
this you actually lose that that little

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.580 
this you actually lose that that little
boost<00:04:08.360> right<00:04:08.630> there<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.049> have<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.380> fall

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
boost right there and you have to fall

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.979 
boost right there and you have to fall
down<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:09.980> here<00:04:10.250> which<00:04:10.970> takes<00:04:11.269> quite<00:04:11.690> a<00:04:11.750> bit

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
down in here which takes quite a bit

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.220 
down in here which takes quite a bit
longer<00:04:12.350> as<00:04:12.799> you<00:04:12.830> can<00:04:13.100> see<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.610> go<00:04:13.760> down<00:04:14.060> all<00:04:14.660> of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
longer as you can see to go down all of

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.800 
longer as you can see to go down all of
this<00:04:15.470> then<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.519> get<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.669> little<00:04:16.820> boost<00:04:17.090> these

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
this then you get a little boost these

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.479 
this then you get a little boost these
are<00:04:18.019> changing<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:18.950> make<00:04:19.100> sure<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.370> get

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
are changing just to make sure you get

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.300 
are changing just to make sure you get
out<00:04:19.640> really<00:04:19.850> nice<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.450> slow<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.799> here's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
out really nice and slow and then here's

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.219 
out really nice and slow and then here's
home<00:04:22.520> stretch<00:04:22.910> then<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.600> have<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.900> just<00:04:24.050> hit<00:04:24.200> a

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
home stretch then you have to just hit a

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.950 
home stretch then you have to just hit a
bunch<00:04:24.440> of<00:04:24.560> these<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.450> then<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.570> just<00:04:26.720> sit

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
bunch of these and then you just sit

it's<00:04:58.370> going<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.550> look<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:58.970> then<00:04:59.570> once<00:05:00.229> that's

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
it's going to look and then once that's

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.430 
it's going to look and then once that's
lit<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.979> only<00:05:01.220> way<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.400> get<00:05:01.640> ours<00:05:01.820> is<00:05:02.060> if<00:05:02.440> you

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
lit the only way to get ours is if you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.020 
lit the only way to get ours is if you
hit<00:05:03.620> your<00:05:03.710> little<00:05:03.950> button

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
hit your little button

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.360 
hit your little button
which<00:05:05.720> means<00:05:06.020> also<00:05:06.590> because<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:06.980> button<00:05:07.250> also

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
which means also because the button also

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.760 
which means also because the button also
resets<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.180> lot<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.690> lot<00:05:09.230> of<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.440> trains

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
resets a lot of the lot of the trains

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.400
