00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.970 
Pacquiao is the kind of fighter in his
prime<00:06:21.560> who<00:06:22.250> can<00:06:22.490> only<00:06:22.760> be<00:06:22.910> beat<00:06:23.360> by<00:06:24.350> himself

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980

sooner<00:06:25.580> or<00:06:25.610> later<00:06:25.670> Manny's<00:06:26.120> gonna<00:06:26.210> throw<00:06:26.480> in

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
another bad night but I think Morales is

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.690 
another bad night but I think Morales is
surly<00:06:30.410> enough<00:06:30.620> and<00:06:30.800> mean-spirited<00:06:30.980> enough<00:06:31.550> to

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
surly enough and mean-spirited enough to

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.570

add<00:06:31.850> man<00:06:32.240> you'll<00:06:32.390> probably<00:06:32.570> be<00:06:32.840> motivated<00:06:33.320> can

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
add man you'll probably be motivated can

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.490 
add man you'll probably be motivated can

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
Morales so many times propelled him to
