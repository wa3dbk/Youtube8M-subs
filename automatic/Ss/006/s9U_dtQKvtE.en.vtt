00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello today we are here to compare us 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 the car seats of group 1 2 and 3 this 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.380
 it will be called innova of 9 kilos learn 6 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.880
 Nowadays we can find several 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.070
 types of chairs and we will talk about the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 anchors the main thing of these chairs and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 you only have time and according to the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 child will evolve and grow 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.859
 the chair and thanking him here 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.260
 we have the chair thunder is of the brand 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.110
 vehicle and it's a chair perfectly 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.079
 valid and comfortable for the child from 9 a 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.409
 36 kilos 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.719
 first phase that would be group 1 we 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.820
 we found with a safety harness 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.410
 5 points 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.059
 therefore the child well subject 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.160
 we will think and adapt of your body 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.350
 we have also for this first group 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.300
 the reducers both of the head that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.420
 we can remove at any time if not 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.519
 we needed and the part of the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 back and the culete to go more 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.820
 recognized at the beginning and then go 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.420
 growing a little put and leaving you more 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.280
 amplitude 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.150
 on the other hand main tourist 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.800
 of group 1 is that the chair angle are 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.990
 very young children have just left 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.000
 of the fund should we have to have then 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.950
 an ambulance more than anything because in children 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.470
 they fall asleep because the head does not come and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.530
 for your own comfort this chair 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.509
 we have the isofix and fiscal xinzo version 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 and social because it is an anchoring system 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.710
 who takes the car our vehicle 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.660
 between the always the endorsement of the part 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.790
 from behind the chair that I am office 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.399
 hooked 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.890
 with this piece you are wearing right we carry 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.930
 right to left directly to the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.360
 car then what we do with that is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 avoid passing the belt and then the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 left of discomfort or fear and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.049
 we're doing well this piece is like 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.460
 our driver seat but 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.140
 kid for car reception 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.000
 directly in this chair is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 mandatory to have the third point that is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.159
 the touch of the touch of is an anchor 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.130
 that the back the opposite side 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.830
 doing that is that we fall to the part 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.420
 of the trunk and is therefore a third anchor 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.730
 just like Jason is where we are going to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.730
 hook this peg 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.500
 that leaves the top of the 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.530
 chair that has the third point so that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.930
 to have fixed by the bottom in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.299
 the part of the being and pass it by the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.310
 trunk and when entering the part of the 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.969
 head so that if we hit was born 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.760
 nothing 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.519
 the piece is subject to both above 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.490
 like below and I do not have practically 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.380
 movement 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.300
 in the case of the becool thunder 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.120
 we can also install it with the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.700
 conventional systems in a car that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.960
 do not have office we will hook part of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.760
 below and part of above and we can 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.970
 take it perfectly in hunter 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.920
 we found a material 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.350
 highly resistant and soft for the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 child while in case of impact will 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.120
 to absorb all the full force that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.770
 We exercise on the child's body 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 we also find the system of 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.190
 lateral protection the right part in 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880
 the left part and this what is going to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.710
 do is decrease the impact in 10 15 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 kilometers of speed therefore 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.940
 It protects and surrounds the child a lot more 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.190
 once we move from group 1 what 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
 we will evolve the chair of 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.350
 ride we have the whole back 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.690
 the harness will remove the reducers and if 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.570
 you notice we have a group elevator 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.970
 2 3 in which we will pass the filter through 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.890
 the guides that he leads as we 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 we are now well what differences 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.650
 we find others from group 1 2 and 3 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 for example montecarlo leave here the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.990
 you have is a chair that is fixed after 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.570
 it's very broad and it's a bit more focused 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.370
 of group 23 for example in the case of 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.220
 stander yes we have a bit of the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.580
 vibration as we have seen before and the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.070
 ring 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.320
 5 point that holds the child as it was 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.660
 until now important in the case of 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.870
 montecarlo we will sit the child and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.970
 we will put this piece and this is a cushion 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.270
 single protection only one point 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.520
 therefore the child goes loose but in 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.800
 case of being born nothing how to install it 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.780
 the belt is the one that hooks 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.480
 diet as you can see in the graph 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.950
 what it will do is keep the child 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.740
 directly from the abdominal part 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.230
 therefore he does not have the fun that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.300
 have the 5 points that stick in 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.790
 five different points but it retains 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.110
 the whole trunk to understand the child 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.380
 another main difference that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.260
 we find is that montecarlo we do not have 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.950
 the need for a sheet with the third 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.960
 point 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.410
 because because the sophist who 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.630
 in the bottom of normal 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.000
 is pivoting then when rotating that in 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.130
 braking case will go up more or less to 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.250
 this height and it will not prevent the 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.260
 part of the head anoints the child this 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.850
 chair would be valid for all cars 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.100
 that they have in sophie's for example 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.410
 thunder as we have seen before would have 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.480
 what to carry by obligation when installing it 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.970
 the third point of torpedoing the part 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.720
 of the trunk we find in montecarlo 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.090
 regulation of both the part of the 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.240
 shoulders as of the cervical part and of 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.910
 the head so that to go closing or 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.100
 opening according to our child go 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.230
 evolving and go growing we are going to 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.030
 see how to turn it into group 2 3 yes that 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.400
 it is true that it is ander we have then 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.200
 let's say that a kind of ritual to 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.210
 continue because you want to give them and 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.560
 condition a little in the case with a 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.320
 dean is a little simpler 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.690
 we will simply remove the excel that is 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.729
 this piece that is only group 1 of 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.569
 18 kilos 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.699
 and we will leave like this towards andia for the 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:49.479
 carrying parts and side passes the 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.699
 car belt type guide and on the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.009
 visa or directly you will go as an adult to 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:56.409
 from 18 kilos come the moment 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:59.050
 we will go up only part of the 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.749
 headboard to adapt it to the height by 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.729
 last let's see multi case fix the 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.979
 trade is a bit then once the 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.610
 between thunder and montecarlo team the good 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:12.009
 of each one for example has the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.169
 gardens of five points the five 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.909
 simple anchor points what 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.339
 we are used to the baby carrier 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.219
 and in the reducer a reducer then a 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:23.830
 little a little smaller dough with jos 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:25.599
 and more traffic easier to take off by 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.270
 example in thunder you had to 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.599
 disengage large on the other hand 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.599
 we find 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.229
 the point and apart of the trunk this is 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.300
 important to remember because according to the 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.490
 regulation is mandatory as of 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.490
 2010 in automobile manufacturing 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.620
 Ellis office normal seat but not 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.470
 the third point then is one thing that 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.090
 so we have to have control to have 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.949
 have a view and know if we have or not 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.110
 before buying a chair because a 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.449
 chair that bears a third point and 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.449
 our car does not carry it we can not 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.130
 installing is not recommended 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.289
 that we will hook from below but the part 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.750
 above in case of braking woman and the 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.000
 child before this one we will do the same as 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.039
 with sanders and we take the third point 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.849
 anchoring by the boot part in 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.160
 group 23 both in thunder and in the 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:20.340
 of casual play we will disconnect the third 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.500
 point we will only install the ix 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.990
 office 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.930
 we will engage in the anchorage of the iso page 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:30.450
 and since we have a weight greater than 18 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.510
 unhooking kilos we have the third point 

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.250
 of anchoring because then directly the 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.440
 car belt to catch the child 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.730
 just like us therefore there is no 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.980
 to hold the chair from above 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.960
 just give you security in the part 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.420
 below and hook the child like 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.770
 we go with the good belt 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.810
 I hope it has been worth a little bit 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.940
 comparative between chairs and tell you that 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.560
 it is very important to always check 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:57.260
 that we have that you see and if we have the 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.260
 third point before perfect
