00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
obviously the fights in Canada and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.070 
obviously the fights in Canada and
Pascal<00:02:01.369> is<00:02:01.399> kind<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.940> style<00:02:02.300> that<00:02:02.690> but<00:02:02.899> no<00:02:02.990> it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
Pascal is kind of a style that but no it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.320 
Pascal is kind of a style that but no it
might<00:02:03.200> be<00:02:03.350> very<00:02:03.550> very<00:02:04.550> effective<00:02:05.090> against

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
might be very very effective against

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.359 
might be very very effective against
because<00:02:05.720> that's<00:02:06.319> Gough<00:02:06.500> kinda<00:02:06.770> hangs<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:07.160> and

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369

because that's Gough kinda hangs out and
jumps<00:02:07.819> in<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.899> know<00:02:09.020> uses<00:02:09.380> his<00:02:09.530> athleticism

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
jumps in you know uses his athleticism

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.790 
jumps in you know uses his athleticism
gets<00:02:10.819> out<00:02:11.000> when<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.360> can<00:02:11.390> find<00:02:11.840> him<00:02:11.959> right<00:02:12.170> she's
