Price is Right decades is also coming

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080 
Price is Right decades is also coming
out<00:02:53.320> I'm<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:54.010> sure<00:02:54.400> about<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.820> but<00:02:55.060> I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
out I'm not sure about this but I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.180 
out I'm not sure about this but I
believe<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.050> price<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.350> right<00:02:56.560> was

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
believe that the price is right was

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.750 
believe that the price is right was
already<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.440> PSN<00:02:59.440> i'm<00:02:59.590> not<00:02:59.770> sure<00:03:00.040> but<00:03:00.340> i<00:03:00.610> think

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
already on PSN i'm not sure but i think

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.790 
already on PSN i'm not sure but i think
this<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.330> more<00:03:01.510> like<00:03:01.570> an<00:03:01.840> expansion<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.770> a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
this is more like an expansion like a

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.820 
this is more like an expansion like a
big<00:03:03.160> expansion<00:03:03.700> pack<00:03:04.060> not<00:03:04.270> quite<00:03:04.510> DLC<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.320> mean

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
big expansion pack not quite DLC I mean

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.860 
big expansion pack not quite DLC I mean
more<00:03:06.100> than<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.430> dlc<00:03:06.880> it's<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.660> big

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
more than a dlc it's just a big

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.900 
more than a dlc it's just a big
expansion<00:03:08.320> pack<00:03:08.650> I'm<00:03:08.860> thinking<00:03:09.640> that's<00:03:09.760> what

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
expansion pack I'm thinking that's what

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.729 
expansion pack I'm thinking that's what
it<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.209> because<00:03:10.420> they're<00:03:10.720> releasing<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.320> as<00:03:11.709> a

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
it is because they're releasing it as a

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.660 
it is because they're releasing it as a
as<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.459> PS<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.330> full<00:03:13.540> PSN<00:03:13.959> game<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.980> if<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.430> if

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
as a PS and a full PSN game so if you if

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.310 
as a PS and a full PSN game so if you if
you<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:16.060> know<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.600> price<00:03:16.810> is<00:03:16.989> right<00:03:17.020> was

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
you do know that the price is right was

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.100
