about the lights on the snowblower the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.299 
about the lights on the snowblower the
LED<00:00:12.299> lighting<00:00:12.570> system<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.260> put<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
LED lighting system that I put on it I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.390 
LED lighting system that I put on it I
put<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.150> lights<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.110> to<00:00:16.380> shoot<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.950> that<00:00:16.980> way

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
put the lights on to shoot so that way

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.300 
put the lights on to shoot so that way
when<00:00:17.700> I'm<00:00:18.619> actually<00:00:19.619> using<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.099> blower

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
when I'm actually using the blower

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.609 
when I'm actually using the blower
everywhere<00:00:20.849> I<00:00:20.880> deflect<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.660> shoot<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.169> remove

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
everywhere I deflect the shoot I remove

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.470 
everywhere I deflect the shoot I remove
the<00:00:22.800> shoot<00:00:23.040> I<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.669> see<00:00:23.849> where<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.180> actually

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the shoot I can see where I'm actually

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.859 
the shoot I can see where I'm actually
put<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.020> snow<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.630> they're<00:00:27.630> made<00:00:27.840> by

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
put in the snow and they're made by

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.220 
put in the snow and they're made by
Grodi<00:00:28.410> they're<00:00:28.829> Dara<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.669> nice<00:00:29.849> lights

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
Grodi they're Dara they're nice lights

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.000 
Grodi they're Dara they're nice lights
they're<00:00:31.700> floodlights<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.410> what<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> did<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
they're floodlights and what I did is I

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.070 
they're floodlights and what I did is I
made<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> special<00:00:36.450> bracket<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:39.630> mount<00:00:39.810> them

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
made up a special bracket to mount them

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.350 
made up a special bracket to mount them
and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.470> see<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.100> there's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.240> of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and you can see it's a there's a lot of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
and you can see it's a there's a lot of
compound<00:00:42.960> bins<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.560> stuff<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
compound bins and stuff in it but it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.010 
compound bins and stuff in it but it
works<00:00:44.730> quite<00:00:44.970> well<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:47.720> gets<00:00:48.720> you<00:00:48.810> another

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
works quite well and gets you another

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.190 
works quite well and gets you another
view<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:51.180> basically<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.690> ran<00:00:51.990> my

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
view of it and I basically just ran my

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.060 
view of it and I basically just ran my
wire<00:00:52.410> down<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.240> right<00:00:54.240> on<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.070> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
wire down and right on up and it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.120 
wire down and right on up and it
switched<00:00:56.400> inside<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:58.470> it<00:00:58.680> worked<00:00:58.829> quite<00:00:59.100> well

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
switched inside and it worked quite well

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.240 
switched inside and it worked quite well
I<00:00:59.310> thought<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.239> neat<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> snow

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I thought it was it was neat the snow

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680 
I thought it was it was neat the snow
really<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.700> stick<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> LEDs<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.660> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
really don't stick to the LEDs you can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
really don't stick to the LEDs you can
see<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> heatsink<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.309> under

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
see there's a heatsink on the under

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
see there's a heatsink on the under
light<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:06.570> warm<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:07.649> bit

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
light so they do warm up a little bit

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.570 
light so they do warm up a little bit
and<00:01:09.260> they<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.440> keep<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> ice<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.520> building

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and they do keep the ice from building

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
and they do keep the ice from building
up<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.240> snow<00:01:12.390> building<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.870> from<00:01:13.050> on<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
up in the snow building up from on the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.550 
up in the snow building up from on the
lenses<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:15.300> that's<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.750> part<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.440> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
lenses so that's that part of it and of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.960 
lenses so that's that part of it and of
course<00:01:16.590> I'll<00:01:17.010> show<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
course I'll show you how I have it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
course I'll show you how I have it
switched<00:01:18.800> it's<00:01:19.800> switched<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> cab<00:01:22.400> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
switched it's switched in the cab so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
switched it's switched in the cab so
there's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> switch<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

basically what I've done I've made them

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.750 
basically what I've done I've made them
out<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.110> aluminum<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.770> put<00:01:58.979> all<00:01:59.130> rings<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.610> them

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
out of aluminum I put all rings on them

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.880 
out of aluminum I put all rings on them
and<00:01:59.909> I'm<00:02:00.270> using<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.689> tubes<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:03.890> for

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and I'm using the tubes now for for

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.809 
and I'm using the tubes now for for
storage<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:08.640> my

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
storage and as you can see I have my

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
storage and as you can see I have my
sling<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.299> here<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.780> then<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.080> tools

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
sling in here and then there's tools

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.429 
sling in here and then there's tools
over<00:02:10.799> on<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> other<00:02:11.099> side<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:13.230> works

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:13.439 
over on the other side and it works

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.379 
over on the other side and it works
quite<00:02:13.739> well<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.810> there's<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> actual<00:02:17.389> job

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:18.389 
quite well and there's the actual job

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.670
