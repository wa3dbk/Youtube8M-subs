00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
guess when that mid season change where

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.609 
guess when that mid season change where
it's<00:00:29.550> not<00:00:29.730> too<00:00:29.939> dry<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.480> not<00:00:30.689> too<00:00:30.929> oily<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's not too dry it's not too oily it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
it's not too dry it's not too oily it
has<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> odd<00:00:32.550> oily<00:00:33.059> patch<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> odd<00:00:33.690> dry

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
patch here and there and it probably

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.270

just find this to be very cooling deep
puffing<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:37.950> definitely<00:03:38.280> more<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
puffing is definitely more of a

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
puffing is definitely more of a
superficial<00:03:39.359> product<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.109> sure<00:03:40.290> what

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
superficial product I'm not sure what

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.199 
superficial product I'm not sure what
the<00:03:40.530> long-term<00:03:40.950> benefits<00:03:41.400> would<00:03:41.519> be<00:03:41.579> if<00:03:41.850> using

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
the long-term benefits would be if using

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.330 
the long-term benefits would be if using
this<00:03:42.329> I<00:03:42.600> guess<00:03:43.019> we<00:03:43.140> find<00:03:43.380> out<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.769> ten<00:03:44.040> twenty

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
this I guess we find out in ten twenty

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.880 
this I guess we find out in ten twenty
thirty<00:03:44.549> fifth<00:03:45.239> time<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.230> really<00:03:46.560> does

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
thirty fifth time but it really does

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.039 
thirty fifth time but it really does
help<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.670> reduce<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.359> puffiness<00:03:48.750> in

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
help to just reduce that puffiness in

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.530 
help to just reduce that puffiness in
the<00:03:49.260> eye<00:03:49.290> area<00:03:49.859> it's<00:03:50.310> especially<00:03:50.790> good<00:03:51.180> if<00:03:51.420> you

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
the eye area it's especially good if you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.789 
the eye area it's especially good if you
can<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.810> bothered<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.140> pop<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.650> your

morning and dab it on however I just

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.069 
morning and dab it on however I just
think<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.790> bridge<00:03:57.030> is<00:03:57.209> too<00:03:57.390> far<00:03:57.600> away<00:03:57.690> even

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
think this bridge is too far away even

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
though it's about ten steps so I just

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.190 
though it's about ten steps so I just
leave<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.700> in<00:03:59.880> my<00:04:00.030> bathroom<00:04:00.420> hope<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.140> the

cream it hasn't got that classic serum

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.360 
cream it hasn't got that classic serum
kind<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.229> silky<00:04:34.590> texture<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.100> it

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
kind of silky texture to it

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.800 
kind of silky texture to it
and<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.850> just<00:04:36.000> take<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.210> over<00:04:36.510> my<00:04:36.630> face

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
and then I just take that over my face

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.350 
and then I just take that over my face
massage<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:37.889> it<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.550> does<00:04:38.910> help<00:04:39.210> to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
massage it in and it really does help to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240 
massage it in and it really does help to
brighten<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.020> skin<00:04:40.229> it's<00:04:40.650> got<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.800> high<00:04:41.010> level

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
brighten the skin it's got a high level

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.740 
brighten the skin it's got a high level
of<00:04:41.400> vitamin<00:04:41.760> C<00:04:41.940> in<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.150> which<00:04:42.360> helps<00:04:42.540> with

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
of vitamin C in it which helps with

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.930 
of vitamin C in it which helps with
dullness<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.620> evening<00:04:44.250> out<00:04:44.370> your<00:04:44.639> complexion

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
dullness and evening out your complexion

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.360 
dullness and evening out your complexion
but<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.720> just<00:04:46.020> find<00:04:46.229> that<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.530> really<00:04:46.979> brings

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
but I just find that it really brings

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.280 
but I just find that it really brings
that<00:04:47.760> glow<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.389> it<00:04:48.450> just<00:04:48.720> helps<00:04:49.020> whatever

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
that glow and it just helps whatever

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.620 
that glow and it just helps whatever
goes<00:04:49.530> on<00:04:49.560> top<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.280> absorb<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:51.120> little<00:04:51.450> bit

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
goes on top to absorb that little bit

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.480 
goes on top to absorb that little bit
better<00:04:51.750> layer<00:04:52.380> number<00:04:52.650> two<00:04:52.830> comes<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
better layer number two comes in the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.400 
better layer number two comes in the
form<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.820> my<00:04:54.060> day<00:04:54.120> moisturizer<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:55.169> I've<00:04:55.260> been

form of my day moisturizer and I've been

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
form of my day moisturizer and I've been
using<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.860> yes<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.220> carrots<00:04:56.580> normal<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.120> dry

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
using the yes to carrots normal to dry

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.230 
using the yes to carrots normal to dry
skin<00:04:57.330> rich<00:04:58.020> moisture<00:04:58.590> day<00:04:58.740> cream<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.370> use<00:05:00.000> about

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
skin rich moisture day cream I use about

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.420 
skin rich moisture day cream I use about
half<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.110> pump<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.830> find<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.220> full

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
half a pump of this I find that a full

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.150 
half a pump of this I find that a full
pump<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.910> bit<00:05:03.120> too<00:05:03.389> much<00:05:03.600> half<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.470> pump<00:05:04.620> on<00:05:04.979> to

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
pump is a bit too much half a pump on to

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.690 
pump is a bit too much half a pump on to
the<00:05:05.250> face

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
the face

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.000 
the face
blended<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.300> with<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.840> finger<00:05:07.229> tips<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.650> find

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
blended in with the finger tips I find

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.890 
blended in with the finger tips I find
it's<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.580> about<00:05:08.910> right<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.450> like<00:05:09.690> this

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
it's just about right and I like this

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.129 
it's just about right and I like this
stuff<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.260> was<00:05:10.440> using<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.250> zelans<00:05:12.120> 3d<00:05:12.660> complex

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
stuff I was using the zelans 3d complex

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.590 
stuff I was using the zelans 3d complex
before<00:05:13.530> which<00:05:14.040> is<00:05:14.220> ridiculously<00:05:15.000> pricy<00:05:15.419> and

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
before which is ridiculously pricy and

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.420 
before which is ridiculously pricy and
when<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:15.930> used<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.380> all<00:05:16.500> up<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:17.070> thought<00:05:17.250> I

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
when I used it all up I just thought I

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.700 
when I used it all up I just thought I
cannot<00:05:17.820> repurchase<00:05:18.419> this<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:19.289> I<00:05:19.320> went<00:05:19.500> for<00:05:19.650> a

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
cannot repurchase this so I went for a

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.190 
cannot repurchase this so I went for a
slightly<00:05:20.039> more<00:05:20.330> affordable<00:05:21.330> alternative<00:05:21.539> and

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
slightly more affordable alternative and

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.719 
slightly more affordable alternative and
I've<00:05:22.260> really<00:05:22.590> been<00:05:22.770> enjoying<00:05:22.979> it<00:05:23.400> it's<00:05:23.550> quite

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
I've really been enjoying it it's quite

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.330 
I've really been enjoying it it's quite
rich<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.050> not<00:05:25.200> too<00:05:25.500> heavy<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.250> that's

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
rich but it's not too heavy and that's

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.430 
rich but it's not too heavy and that's
what<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.729> about<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.180> makeup<00:05:27.930> doesn't<00:05:28.169> look

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
what I like about it makeup doesn't look

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.590 
what I like about it makeup doesn't look
too<00:05:28.680> shiny<00:05:28.979> or<00:05:29.250> too<00:05:29.610> much<00:05:29.760> over<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.240> top<00:05:30.389> of<00:05:30.419> it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
too shiny or too much over the top of it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.270 
too shiny or too much over the top of it
actually<00:05:30.780> provides<00:05:31.229> a<00:05:31.350> really<00:05:31.710> good<00:05:31.830> base<00:05:32.010> for

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
actually provides a really good base for

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.560 
actually provides a really good base for
makeup<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.030> just<00:05:33.180> these<00:05:33.300> things

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
makeup and it's just these things

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.210 
makeup and it's just these things
looking<00:05:34.050> very<00:05:34.260> glowy<00:05:34.620> but<00:05:34.889> like<00:05:35.039> I<00:05:35.160> said

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
looking very glowy but like I said

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.000 
looking very glowy but like I said
without<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:35.970> heavy<00:05:36.330> heavy<00:05:37.080> texture<00:05:37.860> you

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
without that heavy heavy texture you

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.129 
without that heavy heavy texture you
can't<00:05:38.280> feel<00:05:38.520> it<00:05:38.550> on<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.910> skin<00:05:39.120> at<00:05:39.389> all<00:05:39.450> it's

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
can't feel it on the skin at all it's

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.810 
can't feel it on the skin at all it's
definitely<00:05:40.560> gonna<00:05:40.680> be<00:05:40.770> upping<00:05:41.190> my<00:05:41.250> hydration

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
definitely gonna be upping my hydration

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.940 
definitely gonna be upping my hydration

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
which I think most of you have probably

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.600 
which I think most of you have probably
guessed<00:05:47.970> was<00:05:48.330> an<00:05:48.510> SPF<00:05:48.930> and<00:05:49.169> in<00:05:49.229> the<00:05:49.320> summer

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
guessed was an SPF and in the summer

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.490 
guessed was an SPF and in the summer
100%<00:05:50.610> it<00:05:50.760> was<00:05:50.910> an<00:05:51.270> SPF<00:05:51.810> is<00:05:51.960> still<00:05:52.139> something

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
100% it was an SPF is still something

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.290 
100% it was an SPF is still something

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
feels like a bit of a cheat to use this

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.490 
feels like a bit of a cheat to use this
but<00:07:06.730> it<00:07:06.820> really<00:07:07.150> does<00:07:07.540> just<00:07:07.870> help<00:07:08.080> to<00:07:08.200> really

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
but it really does just help to really

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.410 
but it really does just help to really
perk<00:07:08.770> things<00:07:09.130> but<00:07:09.310> with<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.550> complexion<00:07:09.910> so

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
perk things but with the complexion so

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.290 
perk things but with the complexion so
it's<00:07:11.110> magic<00:07:11.560> it's<00:07:11.830> pricey<00:07:12.370> but<00:07:12.730> I<00:07:12.790> love<00:07:12.970> it

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
it's magic it's pricey but I love it

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.090 
it's magic it's pricey but I love it
so<00:07:13.480> that<00:07:13.690> is<00:07:13.930> everything<00:07:14.590> it<00:07:14.710> might<00:07:14.800> look<00:07:15.040> a

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
so that is everything it might look a

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.830 
so that is everything it might look a
little<00:07:15.280> bit<00:07:15.490> time-consuming<00:07:15.820> or<00:07:16.510> laid<00:07:16.690> out

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840
