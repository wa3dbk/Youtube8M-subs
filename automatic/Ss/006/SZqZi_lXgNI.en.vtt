00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 with the greatest good in this video they 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 I will teach how to activate airplane mode 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.150
 in an airplane is a goal configuration 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.700
 disable the wifi deactivates data e 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 it even disables the entry and exit 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 of phone calls magically the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.119
 phone is working as a 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 simple visitable with which we can 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.680
 play listen to music and without having to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.470
 turn off the phone when we go and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.059
 we are doing air travel there are two 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.120
 ways to activate and deactivate the mode 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.020
 plane the first is by pressing the button 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.230
 off 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.890
 we leave sunken and select the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.000
 option that says airplane mode 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.750
 immediately when I the mode 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.870
 plane up here the wifi will be disabled 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 and sense activates the input system and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 exit calls 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.930
 encourages me to accept 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.549
 we see how the mode of 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 plane in this mode then they will arrive 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.909
 calls we can not make calls 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.909
 we will not be able to use wifi and data 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.380
 the second option of how to activate and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.290
 deactivate the plane is by 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 configurations that are more than 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.550
 configurations 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.620
 we go to more configurations and in 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.390
 effectively here is the first 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.040
 option is chuleado means that the 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.040
 model airplane is on 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.480
 let's destroy 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.020
 he asks us 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.590
 and we are going to accept and here the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.560
 data return wifi and a dam of the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.750
 entry and exit of calls that was 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.130
