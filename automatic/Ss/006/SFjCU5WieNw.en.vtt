00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
colors any color yes and then you cut it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.249 
colors any color yes and then you cut it
out<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.330> what<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
out and then what is it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.249 
out and then what is it
all<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.220> lights<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.700> cut<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:18.930> now

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
all the lights are cut off like now now

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.249 
all the lights are cut off like now now
to<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.400> fold<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.270> half<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to do if you fold it in half like that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
to do if you fold it in half like that
so<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.130> almost<00:01:23.250> time<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.030> puzzle

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so it's almost time it's like a puzzle

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.890 
so it's almost time it's like a puzzle
ring<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.229> cut<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:26.360> some<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> have

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ring and you cut it out some of you have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.370 
ring and you cut it out some of you have
probably<00:01:27.930> done<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.100> before<00:01:29.840> then<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
probably done this before then if this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.530 
probably done this before then if this
does<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.770> work<00:01:31.950> I'll<00:01:32.189> show<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.360> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
does not work I'll show you that will be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.540 
does not work I'll show you that will be
a<00:01:33.570> lesson<00:01:33.750> learned<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.400> people

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.600 

then<00:01:40.550> when<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.850> open<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.270> up<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:42.260> will<00:01:42.440> be<00:01:42.620> like

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
then when you open it up it will be like

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.420 
then when you open it up it will be like
back<00:01:43.850> then<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.290> don't<00:01:45.530> have<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.220> but

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
back then you don't have to do this but

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.240 
back then you don't have to do this but
I<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.630> flip<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.050> over<00:01:48.230> and<00:01:50.500> color<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:52.450> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
I do you flip it over and color it and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.290 
I do you flip it over and color it and
then<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.400> just<00:01:55.580> make<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.760> bunch<00:01:55.970> of<00:01:56.150> those

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
then you just make a bunch of those

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.040 
then you just make a bunch of those
different<00:01:57.230> hours<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.100> already<00:01:58.460> made<00:01:58.640> some

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
different hours and I already made some

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.220 
different hours and I already made some
here<00:02:00.050> now<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:00.920> apply<00:02:01.480> here<00:02:02.480> all<00:02:02.870> are

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
here now on this apply here all are

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.330 
here now on this apply here all are
youtubers<00:02:05.590> okay<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.830> then<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:08.149> far<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:09.310> had<00:02:10.310> a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
youtubers okay and then so far I had a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.400 
youtubers okay and then so far I had a
yellow<00:02:10.580> one<00:02:10.880> but<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.420> probably<00:02:11.720> got<00:02:11.960> her<00:02:12.140> life

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
yellow one but it probably got her life

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.590 
yellow one but it probably got her life
I<00:02:12.710> probably<00:02:13.670> threw<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.000> away<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:16.600> then

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
I probably threw it away but and then

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.100 
I probably threw it away but and then
you<00:02:17.630> just<00:02:18.020> keep<00:02:18.200> making<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.430> bunch<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.820> those<00:02:20.110> um

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you just keep making a bunch of those um

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.540 
you just keep making a bunch of those um
and<00:02:21.800> um<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.940> also<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:27.100> thing<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.400> you
