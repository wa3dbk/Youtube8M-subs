00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 or 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.170
 the most important changes in the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.110
 2012 season of the dtm are the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 cars with the return of BMW starts 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.950
 a new era for the competition of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.280
 most important cars in the world after 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.320
 of formula 1 after 6 years in the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.090
 that the dtm was just a showdown 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 between audi and mercedes is always 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 welcome to the arrival of a new 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.330
 competitor for this new season already 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.949
 they are not used until now used 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.809
 mid-range limousines of both 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.730
 premium manufacturers but they will be 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.210
 obviously the sports coupes those that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 will catch the eyes of fans 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.510
 it will be the first time in 12 years that only 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.170
 will see new cars in the line of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.719
 starting the audi a5 dtm will be measured with the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.850
 mercedes to ngs coupe and the completely 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.850
 new bmw m-3 cdm 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.470
 these racing cars will be 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.930
 Powered by eight-cylinder engines 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.450
 with four liters of displacement and 500 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.610
 horsepower the new family of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.250
 coupe is of the dtm looks great and strong 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.110
 on the asphalt it is clear that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.909
 the cars have grown while the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.780
 height has been reduced by about five 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.060
 centimeters 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.070
 Mercedes has not only discovered the uses 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.080
 aerodynamic mirrors but that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.729
 has taken them to the tip the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.619
 suspension looks like a cantilever that in 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.840
 actually it is a mirror placed 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.580
 with two folds both Mercedes and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.780
 audi place different flaps on the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.150
 front of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.180
 tmb for its part has desisted to carry 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.770
 out this practice the Bavarians are still 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.200
 your own way when it comes to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.600
 apply aerodynamics from behind in the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 spoiler zone the m3 has dispensed with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 the audi students for their part uses 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 a kind of fin that improves the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.180
 aerodynamic ventilation of the area 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.100
 of the wheels on the back of 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.210
 mercedes show horseshoes that do not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.210
 they look in the other cars 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.660
 There is a big difference between 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.150
 back parts 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040
 while bmw only has one opening in 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.160
 the central part audio and class c 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.350
 they have other additional ones especially of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.330
 Mercedes where they are very notorious 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.030
 which of these concepts offers the best 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.160
 performance we will have to pay attention to the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.000
 2012 season of the German championship 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 dmt passenger cars
