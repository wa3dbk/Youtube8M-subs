00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:11.230
 In fact, I've been doing One Piece Kings, which I'm looking for 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:17.289
 7 I hope to do a cyber presentation 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.949
 Today I just bought a card and the contents of the game are not getting ready 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.949
 To go 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:32.390
 A good name is the place I entered 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.390
 As there was or visual thing on the way, we are not deviated so much 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.390
 That's it for now 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:52.390
 Te' Well, it's the other in elegant but I have a Toko in Zu' to fellow 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:55.420
 Because here is another why body I came out even fellow you something card was also a matching room 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.170
 Has not been involved in 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 About the contents of the game after the introduction of the way of the game 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.890
 This pirate a little more to say here Well 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.890
 Addendum of mother Kota who got free distribution 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:21.390
 But is what is giving me about it is the appendix of the card magazine 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:25.130
 This shareholders here I guy that comes with spears also here is 100 yen in the game at 7 Free 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.180
 I will be a card that can be made with 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.570
 Here is the name of the pirate team on 3 days 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:41.799
 Heart Pirates, please packed separately after Well suitably I name this 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.799
 It's not the same as back Hano card but is back together 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:51.170
 Continue this mountain without this pirate coat of arms 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:56.969
 Because when the bereaved Yamana will be standing Bell 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 Well I think that it is okay if you bring this one too many times too 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:06.830
 Because in bone is a long card attached to here mouse has become a little hard card 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.399
 It is such a feeling Well at eh 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.290
 Is it a function before 1 time ? 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.210
 It is Kasuga 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.580
 There is a place to fight against Bitter 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.270
 I'm not losing it there 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.790
 Strengthen the card 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.790
 I want to challenge yesterday 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 So the card 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.280
 And I'd have to say I want to wake 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.130
 It is possible to say that it is severe 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.130
 I thought I saw a life pet so a little 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.580
 Mast 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.100
 Have 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.330
 Equip a Label Item to Level 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.470
 There is a way to raise it and show it for awakening 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.470
 Speaking in blue key 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.920
 The dating of Tteyuu published as normal even in the love I'm What this roughy Rashiki also 2 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.360
 One to become do I'm Luffy 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.230
 Well the woman pattern here does not change a little , but all this pattern 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.040
 If you try 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 It is a bill combatant and a two-piece lord 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:23.740
 It's a rice pretend ward, but it's tough without a bit of rush if you try this all 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:30.440
 I wondered if it was impossible 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.840
 The game is like this It feels like the mighty enemies of the world of pieces appear one after another 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.310
 Maybe this is 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.560
 The name was a bit confusing, but it 's up 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.560
 I wondered one thing in this 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.799
 It is a village of Centersap, I wondered why there was no face there . 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.000
 but 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:58.820
 It's array Sutobura or eighth Dorazappu is wanted to direct, and they Na do not come out 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.170
 It seems that 2 d group or something that I thought was probably not good 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:05.590
 Because 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.590
 There are a little pity not but well little by little 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.540
 It does also aligned in only Well people After a little more aligned all only in the first phase of the card 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.340
 I think 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.040
 A little that even in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.460
 If bosses do not fight for a little boss 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.580
 Because it is severe 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:32.729
 Well I boss of this neighborhood I was obtained Why hand immediately fellow 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:36.559
 Since I the other location is a little bit I think I want to do well one way 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.559
 Thank you for your viewing
