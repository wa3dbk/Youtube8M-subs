because<00:03:03.540> i<00:03:03.600> had<00:03:03.780> father<00:03:04.019> video<00:03:04.380> after<00:03:04.650> i

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
because i had father video after i

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.790 
because i had father video after i
bought<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.360> she<00:03:06.360> said<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
bought this she said that it it is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.160 
bought this she said that it it is
comparable<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> 187<00:03:09.090> she<00:03:09.390> did<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> comparison

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
comparable to 187 she did the comparison

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.600 
comparable to 187 she did the comparison
