he's mistaken we talked about rational

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.720 
he's mistaken we talked about rational
behavior<00:00:22.539> in<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.720> very<00:00:23.929> first<00:00:24.169> program<00:00:24.730> a

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
behavior in the very first program a

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:32.839 
that rational behavior is the norm we

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.740 
that rational behavior is the norm we

of<00:01:21.649> mankind<00:01:22.750> well<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:24.020> wouldn't<00:01:24.620> put<00:01:24.710> all<00:01:24.890> of

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
of mankind well I wouldn't put all of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.890 
of mankind well I wouldn't put all of
those<00:01:25.400> emotions<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.210> same<00:01:26.420> group<00:01:26.659> for

those emotions in the same group for

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.200 
those emotions in the same group for
example<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.560> agree<00:01:28.280> with<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.790> racial

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
example I agree with you that racial

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.149 
example I agree with you that racial
prejudice<00:01:29.659> is<00:01:29.840> always<00:01:30.290> irrational<00:01:30.920> that's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
prejudice is always irrational that's

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.450 
prejudice is always irrational that's
always<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.490> mistake<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.930> fear<00:01:33.710> could<00:01:34.400> be

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
always a mistake but fear could be

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.120 
always a mistake but fear could be
rational<00:01:35.060> for<00:01:35.270> example<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.960> would<00:01:36.560> suggest<00:01:36.860> to

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
rational for example I would suggest to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.370 
rational for example I would suggest to
you<00:01:37.159> suppose<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.850> tiger<00:01:38.240> walked<00:01:38.479> on<00:01:38.690> this<00:01:39.140> set

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
you suppose the tiger walked on this set

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.980 
you suppose the tiger walked on this set
that's<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.159> valid<00:01:40.340> point<00:01:40.460> wouldn't<00:01:41.060> it<00:01:41.180> correct

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that's a valid point wouldn't it correct

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.770 
that's a valid point wouldn't it correct
it<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.560> usually<00:01:42.799> what<00:01:43.520> usually<00:01:43.780> produces

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
it it's usually what usually produces

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.800 
it it's usually what usually produces
prejudice<00:01:45.740> what<00:01:46.040> usually<00:01:46.430> produces<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.479> kind

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
prejudice what usually produces the kind

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.350 
prejudice what usually produces the kind
of<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.430> irrational<00:01:49.430> behavior<00:01:49.850> in<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.030> part<00:01:50.240> of

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
of of irrational behavior in the part of

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.800 
of of irrational behavior in the part of
mankind<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:51.430> fear<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.670> many<00:01:52.909> occasions<00:01:53.510> yeah<00:01:53.600> I

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
mankind is fear on many occasions yeah I

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.920 
mankind is fear on many occasions yeah I
know<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.140> could<00:01:54.260> be<00:01:54.290> irrational<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.369> that<00:01:56.210> was

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
know it could be irrational and that was

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.660 
know it could be irrational and that was
my<00:01:57.110> only<00:01:57.260> point<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.890> valid<00:01:58.159> point<00:01:58.340> so

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
my only point that's a valid point so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
my only point that's a valid point so
directed
