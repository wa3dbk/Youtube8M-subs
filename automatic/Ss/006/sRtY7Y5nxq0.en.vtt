00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to all this video you have me 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.020
 requested in so many in the past that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.250
 I never did because I thought not 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 was necessarily so important 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.420
 but seeing all your requests 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.970
 I decided to do it also because it is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.029
 a question that we ask ourselves in many 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
 before discovering the little secret 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 so many women spend a lot of money 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.260
 to be able to find the right creams 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 perfect to have this effect of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.579
 totally covered pores disappeared and is a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.430
 problem is that we have in fact 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
 so many and so I think it can be there 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 useful in the tutorial I use this 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.309
 foundation that is the pupa foundation 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.000
 new sun tan foundation is a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.610
 cream and compact foundation 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.649
 sponge I find myself well applied with 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.129
 the sponge though I think covers better 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.800
 and then applying it with the brush from 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 foundation 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.629
 usual than but the 190 and therefore in the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 tutorial will use this is a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.240
 Trick is really simple that a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.799
 Sometimes we don't put it into practice 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.869
 precisely because we have little time o 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.729
 others of us practice without 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.940
 know it and then hide it so 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.460
 perfect precisely without realizing how 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 note just a very small trick 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 which we should always have regardless 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.460
 open pores or not which is work 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.960
 well the foundation you see that it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.319
 you will also notice about you when there 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.569
 rigged if you apply the foundation 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:36.500
 from top to bottom as is usually done 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.509
 you know it doesn't apply from below 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 upwards because in any case others 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.679
 hairs we have in our faces the micro 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.069
 hairs we have in rice by applying 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:49.110
 from top to bottom doing one 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:53.429
 single move or however several but only 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.690
 going in that direction we make them stay 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.690
 the foundation in the position you don't 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.429
 manages to completely cover the pores 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.659
 fails to enter the pole and a 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.520
 cover it 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.009
 instead if we work a little on the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.549
 foundation with the sponge with that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.920
 we have 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.049
 with what we usually use for 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.109
 apply the foundation with any 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.269
 type and liquid cream foundation 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.739
 compact any you will notice that 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.260
 working more informed inter 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.600
 foundation is able to enter the pores a 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.600
 cover them and give a 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.530
 an illusion of no pores why 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.260
 obviously the hole of pore the hole of 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.570
 leek to fill with having foundation 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.820
 a good basic cream and a good one 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.500
 this foundation should not give you 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.990
 no problem is that the foundation 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.120
 entering the pole will build your pores 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.540
 and so if you then stored well and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.090
 doing the same processing work 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.990
 of the make-up remover on the skin 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 you will see that however this problem does not 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.480
 this arrangement will not give you any 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.680
 problem is bullshit that often 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.540
 we forget to redo because we should 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.290
 however, I also tell you why the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.520
 foundation as many products go 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.200
 emulsified worked a lot on the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.780
 face because we can say 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.800
 to do his job his job well 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 therefore being able to have an opacity 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.989
 it was date we try to have anyway 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.670
 feel good on your skin because if you try 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.280
 to do with the same fund to apply it 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.519
 so hastily and try instead a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.200
 work it well and take a picture of yourself in a 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.180
 egg nor the other while networking that anyway 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 there is an abysmal difference on the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.890
 final result is also on the duration in 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.640
 all here of course to succeed in 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.500
 fix the work you have done well 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.140
 you can use a face powder 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.510
 I prefer hd translucent this case 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.700
 use defines it as a DVD power 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.349
 mica forever pop are very many in 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.930
 trade is suitable for this task 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.750
 so try this trick me 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.970
 know if it works when right at 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.709
 next stop that can remember a lot 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.739
 other powders of this kind as ad 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.329
 example the hd of mus 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.329
 but he was telling us 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.079
 giorgio organic the back up artist of 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.079
 pupa
