beforehand<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.750> start<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.079> quest

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
beforehand and you start this quest

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
beforehand and you start this quest
whoops<00:01:52.950> wait<00:01:53.490> let<00:01:53.729> me<00:01:53.759> show<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:53.970> where<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.240> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
whoops wait let me show you where it is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.039 
whoops wait let me show you where it is
oh<00:01:55.610> right<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> long<00:01:57.630> animation

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
oh right so it's got a long animation

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.330 
oh right so it's got a long animation
basically<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> lumbridge<00:01:59.040> swamp

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
basically it's in the lumbridge swamp

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
basically it's in the lumbridge swamp
I'm<00:01:59.640> sure<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:01.049> where<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.350> by

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
I'm sure we all know where that is by

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.780 
I'm sure we all know where that is by
now<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:04.250> south<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.369> Lumbridge

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
now if we don't it's south of Lumbridge

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.200 
now if we don't it's south of Lumbridge
like<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:07.590> common<00:02:07.979> knowledge

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
like that's pretty common knowledge

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.180 
like that's pretty common knowledge
um<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.990> don't<00:02:10.230> actually<00:02:10.770> know<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:10.980> going

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
um I don't actually know I'm going

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.560 
um I don't actually know I'm going
because<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.520> hadn't<00:02:11.790> been<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.000> these<00:02:12.090> caves<00:02:12.360> for

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
because I hadn't been in these caves for

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.650 
because I hadn't been in these caves for
a<00:02:12.630> long<00:02:12.780> time<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.710> just<00:02:14.220> bear<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.030> me<00:02:15.240> for<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
a long time so just bear with me for a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
a long time so just bear with me for a
second<00:02:16.850> right<00:02:17.850> I'm<00:02:18.690> back<00:02:18.930> but<00:02:19.470> basically<00:02:19.770> I've

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
second right I'm back but basically I've

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350 
second right I'm back but basically I've
terribly<00:02:20.220> look<00:02:20.430> at<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.580> cave<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.060> didn't

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
terribly look at this cave I didn't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.900 
terribly look at this cave I didn't
actually<00:02:21.480> realize<00:02:21.870> how<00:02:22.080> small<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.620> was<00:02:22.740> um<00:02:23.520> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
actually realize how small it was um you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.190 
actually realize how small it was um you
just<00:02:23.940> need<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> head<00:02:24.420> over<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.690> way<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.140> you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
just need to head over this way so you

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320 
just need to head over this way so you
come<00:02:25.350> down<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> Rope<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.100> ah<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:27.090> need<00:02:27.240> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
come down the Rope there ah you need to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.670 
come down the Rope there ah you need to
bring<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> rope<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.990> get<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.260> probably<00:02:28.470> should

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
bring a rope to get in I probably should

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.020 
bring a rope to get in I probably should
have<00:02:28.740> said<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.040> before<00:02:29.160> I'm<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.580> here<00:02:29.790> but

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
have said that before I'm in here but

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.820 
have said that before I'm in here but

way around up to this point here you
just<00:02:39.000> run<00:02:39.180> past<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.540> Craig<00:02:39.720> cave<00:02:40.230> crawlers

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
just run past and Craig cave crawlers

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.820 
just run past and Craig cave crawlers
and<00:02:40.890> Cave<00:02:41.100> bugs<00:02:41.400> which<00:02:41.700> aren't<00:02:42.000> particularly

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and Cave bugs which aren't particularly

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.100 
and Cave bugs which aren't particularly
problematic<00:02:44.450> you're<00:02:45.450> through<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.810> sort<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
problematic you're through this sort of

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.170 
problematic you're through this sort of
these<00:02:46.530> two<00:02:46.740> pillars<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.340> then<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> come<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
these two pillars and then you come to a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.060 
these two pillars and then you come to a
stepping<00:02:48.870> stone<00:02:49.080> which<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.770> will<00:02:49.920> need<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
stepping stone which you will need to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.880 
stepping stone which you will need to
jump<00:02:50.400> across<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:51.350> don't<00:02:52.350> know<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:52.620> there's<00:02:52.770> an

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
jump across I don't know if there's an

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.220 
jump across I don't know if there's an
agility<00:02:53.100> requirement<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.570> fell<00:02:55.200> off

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
agility requirement on it but I fell off

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.310 
agility requirement on it but I fell off
like<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.530> dickhead<00:02:56.000> great<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:57.960> once<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
like a dickhead great but yeah once you

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.510 
like a dickhead great but yeah once you
across<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.980> don't<00:02:59.250> know<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.400> there's

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
across it I don't know if there's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.880 
across it I don't know if there's
initially<00:02:59.850> requirement<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.050> someone<00:03:01.740> might

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
initially requirement so someone might

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.140 
initially requirement so someone might
want<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.160> look<00:03:02.250> into<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.550> you've<00:03:02.880> got<00:03:03.000> some

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
want to look into that you've got some

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.090 
want to look into that you've got some
rocks<00:03:03.360> logs<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:04.620> you've<00:03:04.740> got<00:03:04.770> giant

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
rocks logs and then you've got giant

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.410 
rocks logs and then you've got giant
frogs<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.820> another<00:03:06.540> stepping<00:03:07.110> stone<00:03:07.220> and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
frogs and another stepping stone and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.750 
frogs and another stepping stone and
just<00:03:09.420> need<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.630> hop<00:03:09.750> across<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.170> one<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.620> well

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
just need to hop across this one as well

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.860 
just need to hop across this one as well
that's<00:03:11.760> more<00:03:11.910> giant<00:03:12.270> frogs<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.750> other

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
that's more giant frogs on the other

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.990 
that's more giant frogs on the other
side<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.380> fell<00:03:13.740> off<00:03:13.830> again<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.250> must<00:03:14.790> look<00:03:14.940> like

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
side I fell off again I must look like

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
side I fell off again I must look like
some<00:03:15.300> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.600> prick<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.560> yeah<00:03:16.770> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
some kind of prick but yeah you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.500 
some kind of prick but yeah you
basically<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:18.090> enter<00:03:18.990> into<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.590> tunnel<00:03:19.950> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
basically just enter into the tunnel and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.810 
basically just enter into the tunnel and
you<00:03:21.510> follow<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.320> path<00:03:22.940> downwards<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:25.820> on

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
you follow the path downwards and on

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.270 
you follow the path downwards and on
your<00:03:27.210> map<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.870> will<00:03:27.900> see<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.530> quest<00:03:28.800> star<00:03:29.070> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
your map you will see the quest star and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400 
your map you will see the quest star and
a<00:03:29.790> mini<00:03:30.360> game<00:03:30.600> isn't<00:03:30.900> mini<00:03:31.050> game<00:03:31.230> or

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
