00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
just like anything else and then that
bar<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> bottom<00:02:00.659> disappears

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
bar down at the bottom disappears

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
bar down at the bottom disappears
because<00:02:01.649> obviously<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
because obviously that would take up a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.889 
because obviously that would take up a
lot<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.450> lot<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.320> space<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.659> let's<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
lot a lot more space so let's get it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.710 
lot a lot more space so let's get it
back<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.000> good<00:02:09.209> app<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
back there and it's it's a good app so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
back there and it's it's a good app so
basically<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.250> would

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
basically what you would do is you would

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.360 
basically what you would do is you would
replace<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.060> icon<00:02:12.239> for

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
replace the icon for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.570 
replace the icon for
this<00:02:13.519> with<00:02:13.819> their<00:02:14.269> safari<00:02:14.810> application<00:02:15.739> so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
this with their safari application so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.009 
this with their safari application so
that<00:02:16.610> they<00:02:16.849> would<00:02:17.000> use<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.360> app<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:17.629> browse

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
that they would use this app to browse

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.690 
that they would use this app to browse
the<00:02:18.049> Internet<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.830> they<00:02:19.129> include

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the Internet and they include

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.839 
the Internet and they include
instructions<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.659> how<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.220> disable<00:02:22.220> Safari

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
instructions on how to disable Safari

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.160 
instructions on how to disable Safari
from<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.720> iPhone<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:25.069> way<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:27.110> is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
from the iPhone so that that way this is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.559 
from the iPhone so that that way this is
the<00:02:27.319> only<00:02:27.440> browser<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:28.159> shows<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.909> it's<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
the only browser that shows up so it's a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.110 
the only browser that shows up so it's a
good<00:02:29.780> app<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.170> works<00:02:30.290> really<00:02:30.680> fast<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.400> haven't

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
good app it works really fast I haven't

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.360 
good app it works really fast I haven't
seen<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:33.200> was<00:02:33.560> browsing<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:34.040> couple<00:02:34.310> of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
seen I I was browsing a couple of

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.130 
seen I I was browsing a couple of
websites<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.269> didn't<00:02:35.540> get<00:02:35.659> blocked<00:02:35.900> or

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
websites and I didn't get blocked or

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.770 
websites and I didn't get blocked or
anything<00:02:36.349> but<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:37.579> wasn't<00:02:38.060> really<00:02:38.269> looking<00:02:38.690> to

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
anything but I wasn't really looking to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.920 
anything but I wasn't really looking to
get<00:02:38.900> blocked<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.220> good<00:02:40.400> app<00:02:40.930> content
