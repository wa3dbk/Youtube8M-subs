00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.450
 prepare these rich vanilla ice creams 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.450
 with milkmaid 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.869
 a liter of water a cup of sugar 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.079
 vanilla milk artificial concentrate 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.329
 condensed 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.240
 in a container we are going to put the liter 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.950
 of water 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.770
 let's put the sugar cup 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.140
 and we will put the good if you want 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.270
 you can stir the sugar a little 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.160
 so that it dissolves faster though 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.960
 it is not necessary anyway it's going to 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 dissolve when the water starts to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.430
 warm up but I prefer to remember it a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.140
 little let's wait for it to start 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.170
 boil and when it starts to boil let's 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.310
 leave about 3 minutes to take after 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.410
 we put out the fire 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.820
 is what boils water I'm going to go 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.250
 putting the lessons of the sachets 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.670
 I will load the sachets of this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.460
 shape 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.110
 I'm going to roll them down to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.869
 put in the dairy that I do not have all 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 muddy the bag directly put the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.009
 milk in the sachet 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.729
 This will bring the freezer no 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.939
 we are going to tie the bag because we 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.470
 still need to put the vanilla here 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.509
 you are going to put the amount that 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.520
 want but they will calculate that you 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.500
 come out about 10 or 12 ice creams with the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.720
 I 'll put it to six 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.940
 I'm putting a lot of bags because 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.950
 nothing else I will do six sides but with 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.560
 a dairy that you have to reach for 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.450
 10 or 12 ice creams I put them 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.970
 about 2 tablespoons because nothing 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 more I will make 6 with a spoonful 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.509
 I will perfectly leave both sides and it is 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.789
 stop the ranchera leftovers now the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.280
 let's put in the freezer, we're not going 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.819
 to knot the bags we're going to 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.780
 put in the freezer like this in this way 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.369
 being careful not to leave 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.039
 spill the milk for outside the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.929
 bags in what boils the water and it 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.660
 it cools because we have to do it when 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.520
 be cold let's leave in the sachet 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 Dairy area in the freezer 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:24.020
 since the water is cold we are going to put it 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:26.930
 in a container and let's put the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.480
 vanilla concentrate I'm going to put 4 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.610
 spoonfuls of vanilla concentrate if 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.880
 you use the concentrate 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.680
 artificial this will put from 4 to 6 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.670
 scoops depending how they like to 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.980
 you the taste 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.200
 but if they put the natural vanilla to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.270
 put more amount have to put as 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 a little vanilla room for them 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.830
 taste well because the vanilla 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.720
 natural is much softer than 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.090
 artificial concentrate concentrate 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.040
 stronger artificial to me it seems 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.210
 that lacks a bit of flavor I'm going to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.010
 put a teaspoon more 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.200
 you're going to try it, they're going to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.580
 stop the taste that you like 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.710
 it has to be a little strong on 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.800
 vanilla flavor now the taste 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.080
 it seems that the color is very good 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.810
 is very strong so that they have more 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.540
 account the color you have to put 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.790
 powder coloring I found this 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.030
 gel dye that is black 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.000
 I put a very little silly because 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.500
 it was already going on and I thought 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.540
 that was better was not in good 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 conditions but I put it very little 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.500
 just to give it a little bit more 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.930
 intensity black color when you 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.960
 make them always come with time and they 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.570
 they buy a dye either in powder or 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.690
 in gel for my stage I'm going to put it 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.030
 refrigerator because to put it to the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.760
 connection to have to be a little bit 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.710
 side if I put the vanilla so 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.530
 is warm affects the time I'm going to 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.970
 easily melt the election and how 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.800
 I do not want them to be as well as very 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.080
 mixed with the vanilla that what 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.450
 wants to separate and is going to put it to 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.400
 cool approximately good 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.340
 since it is frozen in the water with the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.230
 vanilla let's prepare the ice creams myself 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.209
 I'm going to take out the bags of one 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.700
 I do not want to be stirred up in the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.079
 milk with the vanilla then I'm going 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.229
 to put very carefully 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.170
 do not stir much we're going to 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.600
 make the knot 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.180
 and you do not have to mix the milkmaid with 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.040
 the vanilla is going to stay and now the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.080
 I'm going to take it to the freezer, I'm going to go 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.090
 doing one by one and I'll go 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.950
 getting in like this I'm going to get one or two 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.410
 and I'm doing them fast and I return them 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.290
 to the freezer so that it does not mix 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.900
 dairy with vanilla and so we have left 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.900
 already frozen the vanilla ice cream with 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.410
 milkmaid as you can see the milkmaid is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.640
 separated in the vanilla this is 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.400
 delicious I hope you liked it
