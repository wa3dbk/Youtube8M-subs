00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.660
 A sizeable group enters the final phase of this classic in this is it 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.620
 last climb of the day no but if you have paolo bettini and behind him big one 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.129
 names like that everyone wants to get rid of the ball are samuel sanchez 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.159
 is 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.539
 everything must happen somewhere, it must go there 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 bettini again 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.179
 is good enough this can be done a few times in a row 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.599
 that's how it was at the world championship 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.609
 what a strong sale that is behind it 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.100
 that is surprising 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.200
 from far away 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.380
 we are in third position, we see a lot of color and the pedals are there 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 demarrage of v 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.400
 with this team 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.890
 he must respond 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.540
 behind that force field of further follow 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.080
 the teams are sitting 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.710
 rutten were left behind 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.580
 it is more likely to have occurred before his thigh continued 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 this is the time to cycle through 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.290
 tickets of 6 there may be able to 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 Menshov only now stated beyond the line 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 it is not always very good 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 sometimes there is not yet behind 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.690
 it is sometimes is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.840
 sometimes it is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.750
 does the track for his specialty 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.190
 and that is clear 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.780
 3 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.490
 our western society 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 what's behind the valverde name of an attacking team with the last wheel 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:46.040
 see 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.110
 it is a dream leading group 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.620
 here are winners such as 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 an organization of a large competition 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.080
 swartjes on top now it's the left bar as you call it also started this is 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.790
 do not drive full no, the riders will come back from behind 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.060
 the five men who now get the company 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.729
 expect a lot of color yourself 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.729
 Hey 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 there it goes you have to go again 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.359
 days beautiful beach of san sebastian 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.579
 drm 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.719
 holds out 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.719
 has ten meters 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.419
 radar attracts nice strikers 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.079
 I do have those who attend school 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.079
 so far it is in the wild 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.649
 what do you do as a company or money has been paid bettini is coming 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.609
 this idea in the wheel of valverde so further away from far beyond 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.259
 still full of verve 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.259
 it is no further steps against faber 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.889
 Pechtold further more interesting was Jan Reker, among other things 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.519
 Putin who is the world champion 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 kortrijk 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.779
 there was one of the two star players resting who will now go redknapp 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.279
 the servants finally third 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:27.289

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.689
