00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.960
 good how about youtube friends here 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.530
 I bring another title of agua zamora with the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.390
 subject kisses and caresses this system if 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.199
 it's a bit complicated to play it on 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.929
 the keyboard like that can be but it's a 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.179
 little complicated to josh and battled and I have 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:25.740
 to change some notes so that I stay 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:28.650
 better the song well and in this version 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.259
 teaches us how to play a little bit 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.270
 that is and it made me more comfortable and I think 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.380
 What is the Bayera? 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 and back from getting not to put to the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 camera a certain height that I can 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.570
 see how I play 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.000
 with two hands because if two is required 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.860
 hands for this song at least bud 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.860
 how easy it would be like that 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
 ah 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.540
 this is basically the melody that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.540
 put the ornaments 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.940
 come as a task battle with one hand 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.850
 and it really is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.560
 turn here 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.560
 let's go up 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.870
 and a whole other way than touching it with 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.850
 my hands 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.320
 by the way let's stay with the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 basic and simple way 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:51.010
 it's basically in the main melody 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:52.870
 like the other ornaments is in a way 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.500
 the potocar a little more comfortable 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.500
 I still 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.710
 although to find a height 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.710
 and let's see how it looks with two hands 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 it's already friends that's the way 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.130
 touch kisses and caresses with the hands that 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.709
 is what I recommend you do but 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.580
 be a little better but if you can not 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.580
 do the same 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.100
 Y 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.150
 like you against the way if it 's in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.230
 a better way 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.390
 comment also put another video and 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.910
 luck 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.880
 they are very visible 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.770
 what instruments is that everyone in this 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.700
 song to this song has shades of 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.700
 because of this it is had greater 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 we did 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.990
 how are the main 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:46.400
 and to grasp this cord do not believe it 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.600
 It comes with the organ as drying 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.530
 you get explained here in the styles 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.530
 of jobs here insurance 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.320
 we have that one and we give the second one 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.320
 page 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.080
 and more to catch grupero style 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.539
 and then we stay here first 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.539
 little button 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:23.400

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.069
