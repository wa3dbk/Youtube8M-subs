00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.459
 at 25 years old joel rodríguez seems 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.099
 have consolidated in the goal of 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.750
 Celtic and given his youth he is called to 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.810
 be one of the future goalkeepers of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.579
 the league of bbva after several 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.919
 seasons tanning in second with the 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.239
 Celtic and in a cession with the lugo the 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.550
 Galician made his debut in the maximum 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.050
 category of our football the first 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.559
 day of this season against 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.420
 espanyol in balaídos since then and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.610
 despite not having disputed even half 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.240
 of the competition has already aroused 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.740
 admiration of the celestial fans not only 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.600
 that but has been praised by 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.520
 companions and by other goalkeepers of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 recognized prestige as víctor valdés 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 who said of him is one of the goalkeepers 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.370
 more to take into account in the next 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.079
 seasons in the wall league we have been 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 with this life insurance and with it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.730
 hierarchy that shows under sticks we 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.730
 has answered the soccer test 10 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 a goalkeeper 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.329
 good valdés for the next moment that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.329
 Is living 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.530
 a difficult one I think we want is from 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.740
 those that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.390
 from our sea I like that defense that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.680
 I believe that anywhere I do not 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.310
 like to have on your computer 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.310
 yes 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 a midfielder 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.590
 that iniesta and company are people 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.300
 with a reality and to me personally it is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.300
 the one who is 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 a good striker because it seems 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.840
 that was decided by Spain I think that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.840
 diego costa are in a moment 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320
 a coach 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.720
 it is clear that the easy thing is to look at the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.560
 great but this one of the villarreal 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.560
 a great job 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.130
 one is fine 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 I always liked to play there I had the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.270
 luck to play in the king's cup 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 a good hobby me that's why he said 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 calderón to me personally I like 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.079
 although although I 'm not there I like that 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.079
 people animate like this 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.400
 a match 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.480
 I believe that if it's here in Vale remove 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.070
 Classic party this year 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840
 villarreal we managed to maintain the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.340
 goal to zero and not only for me but 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.580
 for the work of all of the whole 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.580
 team 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.920
 a team 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.690
 is a team that plays soccer 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.379
 putin 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 well I think that to me personally 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.109
 preferred to win a league would be the good 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.780
 I work all year to a drink 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.390
 after all the glasses are matches 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.290
 sauteed the league are you competing all 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.200
 the weekend that I think 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.710
 good when you win a league is because 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.490
 the work throughout the year was good 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.490
 ah
