00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 old kolja there is no food 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 the fed only make a positive 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.389
 calorie balance makes you fat what do you say 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.280
 to all beach figure warmly 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.730
 Welcome to a brand new question of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.810
 week on friday that's a very 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 interesting statement which always 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
 reappears among different 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.699
 videos I have already shot and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.630
 That's why I want to be very short 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.490
 light 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.220
 so there are no bad ones 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.390
 Food There is only one positive 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.430
 energy balance that makes you fat, so to speak 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.370
 and that's what a saying has to say 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.469
 ZwickmÃ¼hlen situation because of course 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 Did you really write that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.180
 Only these can only have this positive 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 calorie balance makes you in the end 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.860
 But then these foods are me 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 sometimes referred to as unhealthy eg 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 protein bars just 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 Crammed with fructose glucose 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 syrup which cause you to just 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.070
 faster a positive energy balance 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.960
 hate and because many people 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 namely not exactly your calories 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.780
 track and so far and because it's mine 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 opinion also for most people 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.299
 just does not make sense all his 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.610
 lifetime so as to forced to live and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.340
 always check the whole control 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.710
 and counting calories and so on 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 That's why they too fast one 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.570
 get positive calorie balance and what 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.310
 then it is just added many 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.100
 food such as one 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 cheap ready-made pizza many substances 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 contain 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.070
 Glutamate a lot of salt chemical residues 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.860
 and substances that arise, so to speak 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.079
 when you bake so you more, so to speak 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.420
 So that's what these foods are 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.750
 simply contain things that yours 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 body very easily make a positive 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 get energy balance and therefore 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.500
 it is so indirectly that way 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.350
 these unhealthy foods to do so 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.659
 being able to lead 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 you're going to be that at this point 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.959
 it is quite simple there are two 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.450
 possibilities either you carry one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.950
 calories regularly you have very clear 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.480
 goals and you say I want that and that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.730
 I want to get too much body fat 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.550
 percent i want my body that way 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.560
 looks and I have no problem synonymous 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 so to track my calories and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.739
 to write everything down exactly 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.319
 this is not a problem then you can too 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.569
 without problems every now and then 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.220
 After this effect of microns principle 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.069
 which I personally think is cool 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 Just eat such foods as 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.810
 ice pizza and I 'll do it myself 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
 also 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.819
 or you say but I am somebody 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.970
 somehow very fast by nature 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.560
 weight and you are in the now 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.600
 situation where you are still overweight 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.980
 you are or too much in your opinion 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.130
 that has always been the ribs 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.049
 definitional statistical federal office 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.910
 and on and on they were always 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.220
 So the Federal Statistical Office not 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.959
 but the media and the politicians and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.670
 many other health books were 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.140
 then always and say the same oh my 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.110
 God we are getting fatter 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.190
 yes just because many people keep bmi over 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.810
 25 but have a bmi over 25 now 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.590
 must depend on the topic but does not matter 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.030
 important does not mean that you automatically 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.519
 live healthier than someone who is a bmi 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.959
 under 25 that means just one 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.790
 being overweight is 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.579
 no health at all 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.430
 Problem problematic on the health 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:42.459
 is it only if it were the ingame 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.810
 that's probably what we're doing in obesity 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.790
 It was just talking about that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 aesthetic yes we just want to sex 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.760
 got nice look and so on 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.230
 But that is another issue 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.510
 back to ours if you are overweight 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.430
 are you want to lose weight because of that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.079
 because you just want to look beautiful 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 and wants to shine on the beach, so to speak 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.370
 or because you want his muscles 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.530
 defined and so on but so far it 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.930
 you did not succeed then you should 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.390
 give them more of these I say 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.760
 Avoid unhealthy foods and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.700
 rather natural natural things 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.639
 because it's with these foods 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.270
 it will be easier to balance this 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.800
 or to get a negative calorie balance 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.150
 and at the same time with sport too 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.250
 I hope that was support now 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.350
 understandably expressed if not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.150
 just ask in the comments 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.010

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440
