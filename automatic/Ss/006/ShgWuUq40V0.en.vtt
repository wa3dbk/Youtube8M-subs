and I know that firsthand because when I
was<00:02:01.940> younger<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.330> didn't<00:02:02.570> always<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:03.020> long

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
was younger I didn't always have long

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.899 
was younger I didn't always have long
hair<00:02:03.500> my<00:02:03.619> hair<00:02:03.650> was<00:02:03.920> really<00:02:04.070> really<00:02:04.310> short<00:02:04.580> and

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
hair my hair was really really short and

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.390 
hair my hair was really really short and
a<00:02:05.390> lot<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.080> my<00:02:06.140> family<00:02:06.320> members<00:02:06.500> told<00:02:07.010> my<00:02:07.159> mom

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
a lot of my family members told my mom

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.270 
a lot of my family members told my mom
she<00:02:07.810> should<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:08.840> shaved<00:02:09.409> my<00:02:09.590> head<00:02:09.830> because<00:02:10.069> I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
she should just shaved my head because I

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.670 
she should just shaved my head because I
my<00:02:10.939> hair<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:11.299> wasn't<00:02:11.629> growing<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:12.650> hair

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.369 
my hair just wasn't growing my hair
started<00:02:13.310> growing<00:02:13.489> when<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:13.819> was<00:02:13.970> three<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:14.510> my

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
started growing when I was three and my

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.229 
started growing when I was three and my
mom<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> beautician<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.610> she<00:02:16.670> washed<00:02:17.030> my

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
mom was a beautician so she washed my

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.039 
mom was a beautician so she washed my
hair<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.569> conditioned<00:02:17.959> my<00:02:18.019> hair

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
hair and conditioned my hair

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.470 
hair and conditioned my hair
consistently<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.549> started<00:02:19.909> to<00:02:20.000> grow<00:02:20.120> until

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
consistently in it started to grow until

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.170 
consistently in it started to grow until
I<00:02:21.080> started<00:02:21.470> taking<00:02:22.280> care<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.519> it<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:22.970> didn't

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
I started taking care of it and I didn't

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.580 
I started taking care of it and I didn't
know<00:02:23.240> anything<00:02:23.420> about<00:02:23.569> taking<00:02:24.140> care<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.349> hair

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
know anything about taking care of hair

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.160 
know anything about taking care of hair
so<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.040> started<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.430> break<00:02:25.610> off<00:02:25.819> now<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.630> I'm

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
so it started to break off now that I'm

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.120 
so it started to break off now that I'm
older

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
older

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
older
and<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.400> take<00:02:28.700> care<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.880> my<00:02:29.030> hair<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.540> see<00:02:29.960> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
and I take care of my hair I see that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.080 
and I take care of my hair I see that
taking<00:02:30.740> care<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> only<00:02:31.520> way<00:02:31.850> that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
taking care of it is the only way that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.040 
taking care of it is the only way that
is<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.450> grow<00:02:32.770> simple<00:02:33.770> as<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.920> uh<00:02:35.050> I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
is going to grow simple as that uh I

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.160 
is going to grow simple as that uh I
blow<00:02:36.410> dried<00:02:36.620> my<00:02:36.650> hair<00:02:40.330> with<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.510> using<00:02:42.050> the

blow dried my hair with the using the
tension<00:02:42.560> method<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.130> feel<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.760> tension<00:02:44.150> method

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
tension method I feel the tension method

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.030 
tension method I feel the tension method
is<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.540> best<00:02:44.990> in<00:02:46.270> most<00:02:47.410> safest<00:02:48.410> way<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.830> my

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
is the best in most safest way in my

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.520 
is the best in most safest way in my
opinion<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.670> flatter<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.870> blow<00:02:51.080> dry<00:02:51.290> my<00:02:51.320> hair

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
opinion to flatter to blow dry my hair

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.910 
opinion to flatter to blow dry my hair
without<00:02:52.010> breakage<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.880> think<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.890> before<00:02:54.890> I

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
without breakage I think that before I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.190 
without breakage I think that before I
was<00:02:55.160> blow-drying<00:02:55.400> my<00:02:55.790> hair<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.540> at<00:02:56.810> my

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
pulled and I just continue to blow dry

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.080 
pulled and I just continue to blow dry
that<00:03:09.590> section<00:03:09.890> until<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.280> dry<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.880> works

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that section until it's dry and it works

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.380 
that section until it's dry and it works
and<00:03:11.360> it's<00:03:11.600> less<00:03:12.370> invasive<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.090> really

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and it's less invasive and it really

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.140 
and it's less invasive and it really
helps<00:03:15.220> keep<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:16.340> hair<00:03:16.490> from<00:03:16.520> breaking<00:03:17.000> off
