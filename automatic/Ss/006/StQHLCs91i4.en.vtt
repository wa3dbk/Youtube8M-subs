anesthesia like this mm-hmm
the<00:01:32.200> slower<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.649> go<00:01:32.880> smaller<00:01:40.709> good<00:01:41.709> just<00:01:42.580> to

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
the slower you go smaller good just to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.339 
the slower you go smaller good just to

again you just inject this you as you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.290 
again you just inject this you as you
insert<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.459> start<00:02:16.520> pulling<00:02:16.970> back<00:02:17.000> out
