modern food processing today is the

is<00:00:17.109> soda<00:00:17.650> which<00:00:18.400> is<00:00:18.430> actually<00:00:19.000> really<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.420> kind

and<00:00:45.579> they<00:00:45.969> aren't<00:00:46.179> really<00:00:46.300> comparable<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:47.319> the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:47.409 
and they aren't really comparable to the

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
kinds of refined sugars that you see in

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
kinds of refined sugars that you see in
soda<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:50.469> the<00:00:51.100> quantity<00:00:51.729> of<00:00:51.760> soda<00:00:52.179> sugar<00:00:52.749> and

soda also the quantity of soda sugar and
soda<00:00:53.199> is<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:53.649> really<00:00:54.100> draw<00:00:54.460> dropping<00:00:54.909> so<00:00:55.120> for

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
soda is is really draw dropping so for

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.259 
soda is is really draw dropping so for
example<00:00:55.749> if<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.929> take<00:00:56.079> this<00:00:56.289> this<00:00:57.039> lovely<00:00:57.519> 20

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
example if you take this this lovely 20

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.000 
example if you take this this lovely 20
ounce<00:00:58.420> Sunkist<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.940> contains<00:01:01.299> 72<00:01:02.170> grams<00:01:02.589> of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
ounce Sunkist it contains 72 grams of

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.660 
ounce Sunkist it contains 72 grams of
sugar<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.479> really<00:01:04.869> astounding<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.740> 72

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
sugar which is really astounding so 72

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.750 
sugar which is really astounding so 72
grams<00:01:06.880> that's<00:01:07.530> 36<00:01:08.530> sugar<00:01:08.800> packets<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.550> just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
grams that's 36 sugar packets so I just

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.640 
grams that's 36 sugar packets so I just
want<00:01:09.910> you<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.060> imagine<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:11.050> your<00:01:11.080> mind<00:01:11.350> you're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
want you to imagine in your mind you're

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.990 
want you to imagine in your mind you're
preparing<00:01:12.130> coffee<00:01:12.310> in<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.670> morning<00:01:12.910> you're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
preparing coffee in the morning you're

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.210 
preparing coffee in the morning you're
just<00:01:13.120> putting<00:01:13.240> in<00:01:13.390> 36<00:01:14.320> sugar<00:01:14.560> packets<00:01:15.010> it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
just putting in 36 sugar packets it's

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.310 
just putting in 36 sugar packets it's
really<00:01:15.490> quite<00:01:15.700> absurd<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:18.300> like<00:01:19.300> what's<00:01:20.080> even

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
really quite absurd and like what's even

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.350 
really quite absurd and like what's even
more<00:01:20.530> crazy<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.430> if<00:01:21.580> you<00:01:21.670> think<00:01:21.700> if<00:01:21.970> you<00:01:22.000> had<00:01:22.090> to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
more crazy is if you think if you had to

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.750 
more crazy is if you think if you had to
go<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.900> were<00:01:23.020> an<00:01:23.170> ancient<00:01:23.350> person<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.250> you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
go if you were an ancient person and you

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.090 
go if you were an ancient person and you
had<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.030> go<00:01:25.180> acquire<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.320> much<00:01:26.560> sugar<00:01:26.770> from<00:01:27.010> a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
had to go acquire this much sugar from a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.670 
had to go acquire this much sugar from a
natural<00:01:27.460> source<00:01:27.700> well<00:01:28.420> you'll<00:01:28.870> have<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.380> work

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
natural source well you'll have to work

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.920 
natural source well you'll have to work
really<00:01:30.130> hard<00:01:30.280> because<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.300> is<00:01:31.510> how<00:01:31.720> much

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
really hard because this is how much

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.830 
really hard because this is how much
sugarcane<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.920> would<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.520> eat<00:01:33.790> in<00:01:34.270> order

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
sugarcane you would have to eat in order

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.140 
sugarcane you would have to eat in order
to<00:01:34.930> consume<00:01:35.290> 72<00:01:35.800> grams<00:01:36.010> of<00:01:36.220> sugar<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.970> would

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
to consume 72 grams of sugar it would

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.180 
to consume 72 grams of sugar it would
almost<00:01:37.480> be<00:01:37.870> physically<00:01:38.260> impossible<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:39.100> you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
almost be physically impossible for you

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.040 
almost be physically impossible for you
to<00:01:39.370> do<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.700> mean<00:01:39.850> would<00:01:40.030> take<00:01:40.240> some<00:01:40.720> serious

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
to do it I mean would take some serious

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.900 
to do it I mean would take some serious
effort<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.740> least<00:01:44.980> in<00:01:45.190> Oklahoma<00:01:45.730> where<00:01:45.880> I

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
effort and at least in Oklahoma where I

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.360 
effort and at least in Oklahoma where I
live<00:01:46.300> what<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.110> see<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.650> actually<00:01:48.159> not<00:01:48.340> that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
live what I see is actually not that

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.160 
live what I see is actually not that
many<00:01:48.640> people<00:01:48.850> drinking<00:01:49.300> sodas<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:49.960> size

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
many people drinking sodas of this size

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.620 
many people drinking sodas of this size
I<00:01:50.440> see<00:01:50.620> a<00:01:50.650> lot<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.920> people<00:01:51.190> with<00:01:51.670> 44-ounce

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
I see a lot of people with 44-ounce

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.899 
I see a lot of people with 44-ounce
sodas<00:01:53.550> which<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.880> just<00:01:55.510> crazy<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.909> that's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
sodas which is just crazy and that's

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.000 
sodas which is just crazy and that's
about<00:01:58.150> let's<00:01:58.780> see<00:01:58.990> well<00:01:59.290> this<00:01:59.440> is<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> six<00:01:59.860> feet

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
about let's see well this is a six feet

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030 
about let's see well this is a six feet
of<00:02:00.100> sugar<00:02:00.310> cane<00:02:00.490> that's<00:02:01.090> about<00:02:01.330> 91<00:02:02.229> packets<00:02:02.890> of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
of sugar cane that's about 91 packets of

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.250 
of sugar cane that's about 91 packets of
sugar<00:02:03.100> which<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.909> just<00:02:04.210> crazy<00:02:04.659> you're<00:02:05.080> almost

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
sugar which is just crazy you're almost

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.249 
sugar which is just crazy you're almost
making<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.770> cake<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.250> point<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:08.080> keep

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
making a cake at that point so just keep

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.070 
making a cake at that point so just keep
in<00:02:08.409> mind<00:02:08.440> how<00:02:09.009> much<00:02:09.220> how<00:02:09.729> much<00:02:09.970> sugar<00:02:10.420> is<00:02:10.599> in<00:02:10.629> it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
in mind how much how much sugar is in it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.470 
in mind how much how much sugar is in it
the<00:02:11.830> real<00:02:12.010> problem<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.849> see<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:13.329> we

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the real problem is you see is that we

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.809 
the real problem is you see is that we
can't<00:02:13.749> modulate<00:02:14.409> our<00:02:14.560> digestion<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.280> sugar<00:02:15.549> I

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
can't modulate our digestion of sugar I

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.910 
can't modulate our digestion of sugar I
mean<00:02:16.389> this<00:02:16.900> was<00:02:17.079> something<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.469> never

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
mean this was something we never

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.710 
mean this was something we never
in<00:02:18.100> abundance<00:02:18.580> in<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> past<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.300> don't<00:02:19.480> really

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
in abundance in the past we don't really

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
in abundance in the past we don't really
have<00:02:19.930> any<00:02:20.080> defenses<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.950> sugar<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:21.790> digested

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
have any defenses to sugar we digested

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.320 
have any defenses to sugar we digested
immediately<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.920> causes<00:02:24.130> extreme<00:02:24.760> spikes

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
immediately and it causes extreme spikes

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.330 
immediately and it causes extreme spikes
in<00:02:25.600> our<00:02:25.750> blood<00:02:25.990> sugar<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.980> wreaks<00:02:27.190> havoc

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
in our blood sugar and it wreaks havoc

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.320 
in our blood sugar and it wreaks havoc
on<00:02:27.910> our<00:02:28.000> pancreas<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.810> our<00:02:29.080> long-term

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
on our pancreas and our long-term

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
on our pancreas and our long-term
metabolism
