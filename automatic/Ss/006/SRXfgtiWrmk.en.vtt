00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.130
 except 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 koevermans 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.169
 have actually established with each other that he has the idea 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.740
 I use those jobs 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.400
 those based on area prevention or reader means flying there that were 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.800
 does not use the least in the front street 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 the importance of the advice for us is to find a new balance 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.570
 between the growth of aviation and the perception in the environment and new ones there 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.690
 agreements and rules were made the new standard and al thani system what 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 both interests 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.460
 the service and with which schiphol the thin line can grow to 510,000 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.589
 flight movements what do you think of the outcome of the advice 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.980
 we started more than 2 in 2003 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.210
 with it for advice 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.770
 de and I see what has now come about then I can only say 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.650
 plan 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.730
 it may have taken a long time 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.470
 but everyone who participated in a process who understands why it is so long 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.490
 to have a door to the rear keeper every page is a chapter 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.860
 and when I see what has come out I think the doctors are the participants 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.960
 all those always stylish 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.740
 that he may be extremely proud of the opted we are looking for 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 After losing the ball according to the agreements that are made in this is very nice 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 use of job system 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.160
 they have two other important agreements 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.940
 it is the ultimate in the restrictive measures that we take so that we fly even better 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.210
 with even less in the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.179
 and in the second place about the liveability fund where we 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.629
 with the three major parties each having 10 million put in to it too 

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:56.850
 distressing cases 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.740
 in the areas where the deen cannot really take away 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.570
 also to be able to operate it better 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.630
 what is the next step going to the room or the giving and looking 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 can become 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.239
 and then the council chamber and a bill to the chamber as quickly as possible 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.389
 and then it also became a formal 3 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.149
 next to the road and 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.299
 is maintained 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.129
 the question is of course how do you proceed when it comes to the limitation 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.639
 at the head of the quality of life there is gaps as a commercial activity 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.139
 we will of course look at Eindhoven and Nijmegen so this is 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.729
 file continues but this is a sleeve
