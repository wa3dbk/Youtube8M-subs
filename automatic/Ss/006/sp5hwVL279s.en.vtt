one I was right about that it's at what
back<00:04:38.520> went<00:04:39.000> up<00:04:39.090> by<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:50.390> all<00:04:51.390> right<00:04:51.650> thank<00:04:52.650> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.899 

but<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.110> think<00:05:01.379> the<00:05:01.469> slow<00:05:01.800> mo<00:05:02.009> flower<00:05:02.310> actually

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
but I think the slow mo flower actually

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:10.730 
but I think the slow mo flower actually
on<00:05:03.949> helps<00:05:04.949> you<00:05:05.039> get<00:05:05.189> more<00:05:05.400> Coy's<00:05:09.469> but<00:05:10.469> I<00:05:10.500> guess

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
on helps you get more Coy's but I guess

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.209 
on helps you get more Coy's but I guess
I'll<00:05:10.979> find<00:05:11.009> out<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:11.939> be<00:05:12.090> sure<00:05:13.069> once<00:05:14.069> I

final stretch of this stage we're on a

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.409 
final stretch of this stage we're on a
place<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.629> don't<00:05:45.689> have<00:05:45.990> no<00:05:46.500> weapons<00:05:47.000> well<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.029> use

place I don't have no weapons well I use

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.119 
place I don't have no weapons well I use
to<00:05:48.569> defeat<00:05:48.870> them<00:05:49.080> so<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.650> only<00:05:49.800> thing<00:05:49.889> you
