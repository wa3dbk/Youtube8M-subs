these images it was a battle in a frozen

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.800 
these images it was a battle in a frozen
forest<00:02:17.950> it's<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.610> got<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> funny<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.540> know

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
forest it's just got a funny so I know

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.510 
forest it's just got a funny so I know
that's<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.380> good<00:02:20.410> chance<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:21.040> that's<00:02:21.220> what

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
that's a good chance if that's what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.640 
that's a good chance if that's what
these<00:02:21.970> images<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.930> those<00:02:23.080> words<00:02:23.380> are

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
these images and those words are

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.890 
these images and those words are
referring<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.490> then<00:02:24.640> also<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.360> hadn't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
referring to and then also like I hadn't

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.360 
referring to and then also like I hadn't
really<00:02:26.080> heard<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:26.890> all<00:02:27.100> that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
really heard of this you know all that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
really heard of this you know all that
much<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.150> guess<00:02:28.630> my<00:02:28.780> history<00:02:29.110> class<00:02:29.320> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
much and I guess my history class is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.560 
much and I guess my history class is
kind<00:02:29.710> of<00:02:29.740> failing<00:02:29.950> me<00:02:30.130> here<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.880> apparently

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
kind of failing me here but apparently

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.210 
kind of failing me here but apparently
the<00:02:31.750> battle<00:02:32.020> was<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.350> really<00:02:32.680> bad<00:02:32.920> like

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the battle was really really bad like

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.470 
the battle was really really bad like
the<00:02:33.310> United<00:02:33.610> States<00:02:33.820> forces<00:02:34.060> bore<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
the United States forces bore the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.000 
the United States forces bore the
brutally<00:02:34.840> attack<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.320> incurred<00:02:35.860> their

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
brutally attack and incurred their

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460 
brutally attack and incurred their
highest<00:02:36.430> casualties<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.450> any<00:02:37.720> operation

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
highest casualties for any operation

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.500 
highest casualties for any operation
during<00:02:38.770> World<00:02:39.070> War<00:02:39.130> two<00:02:39.490> and<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:40.270> also

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
during World War two and then also

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.260 
during World War two and then also
severely<00:02:41.170> depleted<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.890> Germans<00:02:42.370> armoured

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
severely depleted the Germans armoured

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.540 
severely depleted the Germans armoured
forces<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.960> Western<00:02:44.350> Front<00:02:44.380> which<00:02:45.340> they

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
forces on the Western Front which they

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.850 
forces on the Western Front which they
were<00:02:45.640> largely<00:02:46.000> unable<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.540> replace<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.590> why

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
were largely unable to replace so why

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.740 
were largely unable to replace so why
yeah<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.400> was<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.850> was<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> big<00:02:49.180> deal<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.600> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
yeah it was it was a big deal like it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.570 
yeah it was it was a big deal like it
was<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.080> know<00:02:50.200> heavy<00:02:50.440> losses<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:51.010> both<00:02:51.250> sides

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
was you know heavy losses on both sides

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.480 
was you know heavy losses on both sides
and<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.290> don't<00:02:53.440> know<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.370> I'm

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
and it's I don't know like I just I'm

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.130 
and it's I don't know like I just I'm
thinking<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.120> might<00:02:55.390> be<00:02:55.420> what<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:55.990> is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
thinking that that might be what this is

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.260 
thinking that that might be what this is
referring<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.210> really

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
referring to so this is it's really

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.940 
referring to so this is it's really
getting<00:02:58.720> interesting<00:02:59.170> like<00:02:59.320> again<00:02:59.560> at<00:02:59.680> first

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
getting interesting like again at first

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.340 
getting interesting like again at first
it<00:03:00.190> was<00:03:00.550> all<00:03:00.760> about<00:03:00.970> black<00:03:01.150> ops<00:03:01.210> 3<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.020> now<00:03:02.200> it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
it was all about black ops 3 and now it

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.480 
it was all about black ops 3 and now it
seems<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.650> there's<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.950> lot<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.310> stuff

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
seems like there's a lot of stuff

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.880 
seems like there's a lot of stuff
popping<00:03:03.910> up<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.180> references<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.260> world<00:03:05.470> war<00:03:05.680> 2

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
popping up of references to world war 2

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.980 
popping up of references to world war 2
so<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.190> question<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.540> gonna<00:03:07.630> be<00:03:07.780> black

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
so the question is is it gonna be black

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.440 
so the question is is it gonna be black
ops<00:03:08.260> 3<00:03:08.620> with<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.490> know<00:03:09.520> flashbacks<00:03:10.210> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
ops 3 with like you know flashbacks to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.240 
ops 3 with like you know flashbacks to
World<00:03:10.630> War<00:03:10.750> 2<00:03:11.050> is<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.800> gonna<00:03:11.890> be<00:03:11.980> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
World War 2 is it gonna be just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.670 
World War 2 is it gonna be just
straight-up<00:03:12.700> world<00:03:13.000> war<00:03:13.180> 2<00:03:13.450> how<00:03:14.410> are<00:03:14.530> they

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
straight-up world war 2 how are they

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.710 
straight-up world war 2 how are they
