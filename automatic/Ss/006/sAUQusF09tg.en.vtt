00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.620
 gone 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.620
 these are our beaches 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.030
 [music] 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.279
 i pin it there good around 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 [music] 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.039
 right here start rising 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 yes restaurants are two hundred and ten pieces now 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 we will go this way 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.000
 I am a rubber gun 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:57.739
 this beach bar is our turkish 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.739
 the villages 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.170
 or Russian sanatorium in Turkey 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:22.720
 their couleur doesn't work as always 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 very much so you have to climb 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 steps 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 you can admire the flowers ruin 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.280
 many all sorts of beautiful roses 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.760
 sushi and water immediately from pine 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 nature is very beautiful 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.670
 but the number of ladders contributes 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.670
 keeping fit 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.650
 and here is the rail of the inoperative funicular 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.070
 he and the trailers are laid up 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.070
 already a couple of years 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.590
 here's a beautiful view of the bay and there 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.250
 far away on the hills 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:48.640
 we see the fortress of Alanya 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.640
 here and the age-old line and the fortress wall 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.450
 continue our route 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.930
 to overcome the ladder
