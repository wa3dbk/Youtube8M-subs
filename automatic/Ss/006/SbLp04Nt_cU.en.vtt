00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.889
 the young and womanly 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.980
 Today I'm going to teach you how to prepare in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.750
 dyes for chocolate already with 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 This mix I'm going to make now 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 I can paint bonbon cups 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 I can paint the acetate sheet 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 I can paint candy is cakes in the then 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.550
 play on the air compressor spray 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.610
 You will see that you have videos that teach 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 to do this is also very simple here 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 basically I have cocoa butter 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.110
 detained until then realize that she is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 ideal than to withhold this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 butter until completely liquid 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 and then let it reach the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.100
 minimum temperature of 45 degrees then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.840
 come every moment 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 when it has at least one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.969
 at 45 degrees is a time when I can 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 add any of the dyes 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 in this case I have the dyes and in 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.420
 chocolate powder 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.369
 then this dye they can be 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
 mixed directly to chocolate 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.600
 white for those who want to achieve 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 just get a little pouring 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.570
 chocolate has no problem and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.830
 mix is accurate color and will not spoil 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.049
 the prefecture of colatina 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 otherwise I can do this 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.350
 tac ink is fifty here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.180
 during and after the goal white orange 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.100
 yellow and red 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.360
 Can I apply any of these things? 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.759
 remembering that we have the colors 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.250
 and from them I can not 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.110
 make several other mixtures 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.460
 So, for example, I'll show you. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.040
 a red dye is then for each 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 pound of cocoa butter I go 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.570
 add on average 10 to 20 grams 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.990
 this dye to achieve such then in 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.759
 average and one percent come with a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.340
 little big red I'll put 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.090
 here talking a little 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 The ideal is what to mix comics to then 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.700
 that a mixer 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.700
 I'll put it in here. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.760
 the mix right there at the time I get one 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.530
 very intense color like this and that is 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.400
 valid for any of the other 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.660
 Colors 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.660
 So let's wait a little longer. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 The dollar here I get then this 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.590
 mixture that gets well liquid natal it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.599
 turns a very intense red 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.640
 I know that many people have difficulty in 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.900
 get red take off 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.810
 red decorations 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 The solution is here. Done this, I can. 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.380
 work soon 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.940
 The ideal is what I can apply this 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.700
 dye immediately 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.739
 Yes, a good one, no problem, if I 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.390
 want the color to become even more intense 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.489
 what can i do 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 leaves the mixture at rest for 24 hours. 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.680
 hours may be at room temperature 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.410
 or chilled and then the next day 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.660
 during this rest she will capitalize 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.580
 cocoa butter will harden day 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.310
 then just take it again and apply 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.120
 next is mixing the car the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.130
 safety 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.650
 the cocoa imposed with the car with butter 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.660
 of cocoa if you leave in the refrigerator says 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.850
 here has a quiet durability of 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.100
 one month and a half months without spoiling without 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.860
 problem and the dyes to be in 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.690
 powder has a durable life 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.329
 six years minimum 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 So who likes to work with 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.060
 values and achieve such a solution is here 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.410
 and it is logical not to go back to the time of education 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.049
 that I'm sure that every 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.459
 world and is super good and from here 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.010
 you can create several other 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.010
 colors for example showing yellow with 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.650
 blue with you green mixing red 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.109
 yellow orange and blue equal parts I 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.320
 I get black and there it goes. 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.269
 so here's a play as you had the 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.420
 products and achieve a good visual 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.420
 different
