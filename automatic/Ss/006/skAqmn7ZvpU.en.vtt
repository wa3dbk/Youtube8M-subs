00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.850
 hello everyone I'm marcela I hope that 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.710
 are fine today we are going to give them 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.680
 how to make a simple hairstyle and the 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.869
 result will be beautiful let's 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.720
 start by taking a part of hair 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.420
 next to the head we divide it into 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.580
 three and we are going to make a false braid 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.100
 crossing the divisions of the sides 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.629
 always below the one remaining in the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.600
 half crossed below and here we are going to 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.760
 add hair to the braid we are going to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.130
 do it in such a way that we do not stay 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.829
 divisions so thin but they are 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.560
 rather thick so that when 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.050
 we get behind the head we have 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.030
 added only four times 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.550
 here added hair 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 again I cross below 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.210
 and here I will add hair again 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.860
 This is going to be the last time I'm going to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 add hair to this braid 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 here we do two or three more steps of the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 braid 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.940
 and then we're going to start pulling the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.260
 braid on the sides to make you sick 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.240
 volume 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.200
 we're going to want it to stay wide 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.090
 well big look at the difference and what 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.090
 we do from the top 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.680
 later we are going to hold it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.409
 meanwhile with an elastic band 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.759
 and we are going to do exactly the same to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.759
 another side of the head 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 do not 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.090
 well here we already have the two braids 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 then we are going to join them and the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.310
 We hold with an elastic band 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.720
 very carefully using some 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.670
 scissors let's drop the other bands 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 with which we were holding the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.690
 braids before 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.470
 and now let's take a very division 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.200
 little girl from the tail and we're going to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.069
 roll several times to cover the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.829
 band 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.109
 perfect when we already have it we are going to 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.109
 hold it with another elastic band 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.830
 and if you still see it we finished 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.830
 cover it with hair 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.390
 with this part we are going to divide 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.060
 the work in two to make a braid of 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.120
 fish we passed a very section 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.459
 little girl on the other side and side 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.579
 left let's move it now to the side 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.579
 straight 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.740
 again then I step to the side 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.790
 left step to the right side 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.510
 we went to the left side we went to the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.300
 right side and as you can see then this 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.090
 is 30 is very easy is one of the basic 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.540
 and so we're going to continue weaving some 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.540
 Steps 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.150
 when we are here we are going to grab the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.940
 braid on the sides to make you sick 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.820
 volume the idea is that the braid does not 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.310
 go tight but look very relaxed 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.270
 to give the hairstyle the bohemian look 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.270
 What we want 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.620
 and from now on then we're going to 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.560
 continue weaving the braid of it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.629
 way let's go adding volume to 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.730
 As we do and in the end 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.730
 we hold with an elastic band 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.310
 to finish we're going to pull a little 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.440
 hair that is on top of the head and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.930
 This way you will see a little more 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.729
 loose and casual 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.120
 and that's how it looks like finally 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.060
 hairstyle is super cute and is perfect 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.680
 for all types of straight wavy hair 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.780
 or curly 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.810
 that you liked the video give us 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.260

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.480
