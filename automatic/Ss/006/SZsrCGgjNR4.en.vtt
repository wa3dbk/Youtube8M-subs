00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.330 
impossible we'll just try to find the
car<00:02:22.690> do<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.780> think<00:02:22.989> maybe<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:24.040> they<00:02:24.100> pick<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
ten of clubs that's fair and then you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.470 
ten of clubs that's fair and then you
perform<00:02:30.220> what's<00:02:30.670> called<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.970> double<00:02:31.269> lift

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
perform what's called a double lift

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.840 
perform what's called a double lift
since<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> have<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.829> red<00:02:32.980> back<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.190> card<00:02:33.519> 10

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
since you have the red back to card 10

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.780 
since you have the red back to card 10
and<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.660> car<00:02:34.840> that's<00:02:35.019> double<00:02:35.290> sided<00:02:35.500> blue<00:02:35.829> so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and the car that's double sided blue so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.470 
and the car that's double sided blue so
you<00:02:36.880> pull<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you pull the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.470 
you pull the
hand<00:02:38.690> up<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.739> double<00:02:40.010> sided<00:02:40.190> card<00:02:40.489> up<00:02:40.640> so

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
hand up and the double sided card up so

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.559 
hand up and the double sided card up so
it<00:02:41.540> appears<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> blue<00:02:43.819> back<00:02:44.060> card

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
it appears that it is a blue back card

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.699 
it appears that it is a blue back card
well<00:02:45.349> obviously<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.950> know<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:47.709> Redback

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
well obviously we know it is a Redback

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.190 
well obviously we know it is a Redback
card<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:50.510> make<00:02:50.690> them<00:02:50.810> think<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.140> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
card so you just make them think it's a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.860 
card so you just make them think it's a
blue<00:02:51.319> back<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.650> card<00:02:52.180> then<00:02:53.180> you<00:02:53.299> know<00:02:53.420> wave

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
blue back to card then you know wave

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.960 
blue back to card then you know wave
your<00:02:53.989> hand<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.590> then<00:02:55.069> when<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.310> flip<00:02:55.610> just

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
your hand and then when you flip just

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.789 
your hand and then when you flip just
the<00:02:56.090> 10<00:02:56.299> /<00:02:56.599> obviously<00:02:57.019> it'll<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.230> read<00:02:57.470> because

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
the 10 / obviously it'll be read because

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.250 
the 10 / obviously it'll be read because
that's<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.220> blue<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.989> spread

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
that's the blue one and then you spread

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.800 
that's the blue one and then you spread
them<00:03:00.349> out<00:03:00.500> just<00:03:00.799> like<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.599> prevailing<00:03:02.599> that

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
them out just like this prevailing that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.569 
them out just like this prevailing that
still<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.410> only<00:03:03.590> card<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.250> middle<00:03:04.489> is

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
still the only card in the middle is

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.430 
still the only card in the middle is
blue<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.150> then<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.870> can<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.110> say<00:03:06.290> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
blue and then you can just say that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.069 
blue and then you can just say that
maybe<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.980> want<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.849> also<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.690> blue<00:03:08.840> card

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
maybe if you want and also the blue card

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.900 
maybe if you want and also the blue card
has<00:03:09.170> been<00:03:09.290> changed<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.709> other<00:03:10.190> than<00:03:10.430> three

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
has been changed to other than three

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.360 
has been changed to other than three
spades<00:03:11.209> in<00:03:11.420> this<00:03:11.540> case<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.739> that's<00:03:12.920> how<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.340> is

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
spades in this case so that's how it is

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
spades in this case so that's how it is
done<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.860> i'll<00:03:15.860> show<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.040> one<00:03:16.220> more<00:03:16.250> thing

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
done and i'll show you one more thing

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.539 
done and i'll show you one more thing
that<00:03:16.910> helps<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.900> trick<00:03:18.200> though<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.340> is

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
that helps with the trick though this is

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.729 
that helps with the trick though this is
only<00:03:19.640> happening<00:03:19.940> me<00:03:20.209> once<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.810> like<00:03:21.049> okay

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
only happening me once that like okay

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.550 
only happening me once that like okay
the<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.579> pick<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.940> card<00:03:23.209> i<00:03:23.450> put<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.349> in<00:03:24.470> the
