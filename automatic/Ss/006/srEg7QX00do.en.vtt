 [music] 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.280
 [music] 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:23.689
 today we were preparing smoothie guys and 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:26.869
 shared communicated exactly blogger and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.599
 many artists to people who did not find 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.350
 rush to meet 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.250
 have fun and don't know much 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.250
 Today 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.840
 [music] 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:01.420
 Yes, I was a lot of things 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.520
 I studied music naturally 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.250
 worked at that time 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.530
 drummers u eur creda who on that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.160
 the moment rose but began its 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.560
 activity 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.120
 Then there was a very good friend of mine we 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:29.500
 somehow worked together because 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:31.750
 freckles could not live began Natalia 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.770
 creativity and the city ​​is now very 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.820
 is popular 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.090
 does not work and came so happened that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.610
 I understand and the girl is not a musician 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.780
 work is very cool and no matter how 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.969
 them like fun but i'm not really 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.569
 I would develop 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.880
 enslaved and so I decide when 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.240
 fly on no longer stand in one place and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.799
 try themselves on youtube and again as 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.329
 in solo creativity to hit 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.920
 could remain the device 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.720
 so I had to as I 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.310
 spatial still communicate in 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.310
 anyway that's why everything is fine 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.380
 [music] 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.950
 and the couch that they talk about 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.760
 world 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 but since we helmet igorem so 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.360
 let's not know the format I can not hear him 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.460
 such gossip and therefore no we are friends and 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.460
 only very 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.510
 3 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.120
 color drama so to speak 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.109
 I am enough to support myself and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.540
 my family 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:13.240
 so I believe that this appeal 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:16.349
 salary for a man who is great 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.349
