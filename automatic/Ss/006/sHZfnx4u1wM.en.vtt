our menus there is now a new main menu
inside<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> game<00:00:22.170> there's<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> new

inside of the game there's a new
inventory<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.420> store<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.230> scoreboard

inventory and you store a new scoreboard

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.820 
inventory and you store a new scoreboard
window<00:00:26.279> now<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> issue<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.320> these<00:00:28.470> core

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
window now the issue is that these core

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.550 
window now the issue is that these core
board<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:30.210> inventory<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
board and the inventory and the the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.639 
board and the inventory and the the
store<00:00:31.890> windows<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.969> actually<00:00:33.649> bigger

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
store windows are actually bigger

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.270 
store windows are actually bigger
possibly<00:00:35.489> than<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.800> small

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
possibly than some of those really small

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
possibly than some of those really small
tiny<00:00:38.730> resolutions<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> maybe<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.200> 10<00:00:40.590> or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
tiny resolutions that maybe like 10 or

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.720 
tiny resolutions that maybe like 10 or
15<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.270> grand<00:00:42.660> total<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.350> use

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
15 of you and grand total actually use

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
15 of you and grand total actually use
so<00:00:44.730> those<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.960> who<00:00:46.050> use<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.680> really

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so those people who use really really

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
so those people who use really really
really<00:00:47.160> small<00:00:47.550> resolutions<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
really small resolutions are going to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
really small resolutions are going to
have<00:00:48.780> trouble<00:00:49.020> actually<00:00:49.469> navigating<00:00:50.219> through

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
have trouble actually navigating through

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.420 
have trouble actually navigating through
these<00:00:51.020> these<00:00:52.020> windows<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> scoreboard

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
these these windows be at the scoreboard

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.540 
these these windows be at the scoreboard
the<00:00:53.820> store<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> inventory<00:00:54.420> etc<00:00:55.309> so<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.460> I'm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the store the inventory etc so what I'm

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.700 
the store the inventory etc so what I'm
going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.180> try<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> teach<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.530> or

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
convince you to raise your resolution to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
convince you to raise your resolution to
something<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> modern<00:01:02.940> resolution<00:01:03.600> because

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
something to a modern resolution because

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
something to a modern resolution because
I<00:01:04.739> mean<00:01:05.010> anybody<00:01:05.309> that's<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.330> a

I mean anybody that's using you know a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
I mean anybody that's using you know a
normal<00:01:06.900> common<00:01:07.740> resolution<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
normal common resolution is going to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
normal common resolution is going to
have<00:01:08.640> absolutely<00:01:08.790> no<00:01:09.180> problem<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.900> you're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
have absolutely no problem but if you're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.550 
have absolutely no problem but if you're
still<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.670> small<00:01:12.090> old<00:01:12.560> decrepit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
still using a really small old decrepit

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
still using a really small old decrepit
resolution<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.270> might<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.659> some<00:01:15.869> trouble

resolution you might have some trouble

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
resolution you might have some trouble

trust me the least you're going to want

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.780 
trust me the least you're going to want
is<00:02:51.760> 1024<00:02:52.760> x<00:02:52.940> 768<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.650> your<00:02:54.860> computer<00:02:55.370> can<00:02:55.550> vary

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
is 1024 x 768 but your computer can vary

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.700 
is 1024 x 768 but your computer can vary
probably<00:02:56.360> handle<00:02:56.690> even<00:02:56.840> more<00:02:57.110> than<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.440> I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
probably handle even more than that I

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.170 
probably handle even more than that I
mean<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:58.990> 1024<00:02:59.990> x<00:03:00.110> 768<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.980> really<00:03:01.340> really

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
mean that 1024 x 768 is really really

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.540 
mean that 1024 x 768 is really really
pretty<00:03:02.540> small<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.410> we're<00:03:03.770> still<00:03:04.070> supporting

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.100 
pretty small and we're still supporting
that<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.840> anything<00:03:06.220> smaller<00:03:07.220> than<00:03:07.340> 10<00:03:07.930> 1024<00:03:08.930> x

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
that so anything smaller than 10 1024 x

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.890 
that so anything smaller than 10 1024 x
768<00:03:09.740> is<00:03:10.130> not<00:03:10.430> going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.850> be<00:03:11.090> supported<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.720> the

is figure out what resolution your

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
windows 7 by the way but it's pretty

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.930 
windows 7 by the way but it's pretty

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
screen resolution now where it says

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
out what is the highest or maybe

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.809 
out what is the highest or maybe
recommended<00:04:12.920> resolution<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.550> you're

recommended resolution that you're
computer<00:04:14.120> can<00:04:15.109> handle<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:16.009> let's<00:04:16.250> say<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:16.639> in

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
computer can handle so let's say that in

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.340 
computer can handle so let's say that in
my<00:04:17.239> case<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.660> set<00:04:17.959> my<00:04:18.139> desktop<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:19.389> 1680<00:04:20.389> x<00:04:20.660> 10<00:04:20.959> x

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
my case I set my desktop to 1680 x 10 x

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.550 
my case I set my desktop to 1680 x 10 x
1050<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.509> is<00:04:23.539> my<00:04:23.750> current<00:04:24.199> resolution

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
1050 so this is my current resolution

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.070 
1050 so this is my current resolution
and<00:04:25.009> I<00:04:25.280> know<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.639> so<00:04:26.509> what<00:04:26.630> I'm<00:04:26.720> going<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.870> do
