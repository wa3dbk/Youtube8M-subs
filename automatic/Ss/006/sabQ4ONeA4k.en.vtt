00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480
 good afternoon my name is here the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.750
 Toribio Open it I'm from Panama 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.660
 I've been working for 8 years 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.520
 to distribute to really share the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.740
 opportunity offered by a vila and 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.360
 through the nutrients and kindness of 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.900
 products I started eight years ago because 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.640
 there was a need for health in the house 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.140
 and I really was very sick in that 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.050
 day can have a very osteoporosis 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.379
 advanced and did not know how to do consumed 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.460
 approximately 15 pills 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.980
 We started using a product that 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.840
 flame power maker and the power maker 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.450
 started to 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.600
 to do a job that we had not seen 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.850
 with medicines today on her day 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.559
 it's a pretty person it's pretty soul 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.059
 of health does not consume medicines 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.330
 we practically consume a lot 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.640
 nutrients since we met since 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.240
 that I let her our presenter 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.030
 we did not really put them on 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 we fell in love with these products I started 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.790
 to share a lot to a lot of people about 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.440
 everything in the field that I worked in 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.420
 that then that was the university I 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.100
 I am a university professor and I started 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.710
 share the students to the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.320
 teachers to friends and people 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.660
 began to get so much of the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.390
 emotion that I had and both the product 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.890
 that started many began to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.289
 consume the products and many of the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.780
 who started knowledge were made 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:46.240
 after distributors of the same 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.490
 and this has led me to really 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.640
 they talk about the fashion the product has 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.270
 led to develop an organization to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.289
 nationally and internationally 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.049
 so then I could 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.820
 contemplate that years after two years of 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.619
 dedicate myself I feel a teacher in a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.009
 university and dedicating omnilife 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.840
 I started to see that by sharing the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.930
 health people I started to see a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 extra economic increase to part of the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.580
 check that came from the university and 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.860
 one day I started to see that the check 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.160
 omnilife like I was getting over more 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.590
 the pse check of the university and I started 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.110
 I will see good if I see him with a little 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.660
 more than time to a delay I'm suddenly going 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.850
 to have more economic solvency I will 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.190
 have more freedom I will be more 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.140
 time with with our family I'm going to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.850
 have more time to devote myself to 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.390
 my own things 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.810
 the interesting thing about this is that I did not have 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.240
 I do not have a boss there in the university 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.370
 I had a boss where I worked 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.040
 previously what was the design 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.830
 graphic you also had then here I 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.450
 I could see freedom that nobody sends you 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.390
 that nobody tells you what you have 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.100
 what to do but you yourself do it from 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.330
 your will of your time from your 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.250
 space and you do it with the heart 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.260
 that part of the heart really to me 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.830
 has impressed me a lot because it has 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.740
 taken to take care of him very much 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.860
 love the health to the people and we have tried 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.750
 with many people with cancer we have treated 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.880
 many people with leukemia with diabetes 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.460
 how does it produce the case and take the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.130
 Case Mrs. Marcelina with a cancer 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.930
 clean advance the case of Mr. diomedes 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.910
 with leukemia that are totally 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.340
 recovered for me is a satisfaction 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.950
 see that today there are people inside 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.080
 my organization generating very income 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.780
 good and that I can say that a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.620
 person who is suddenly had 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 it is only 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.230
 your level of schooling today canon 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.150
 a professional's check for me that's 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.040
 a profit that my people win is a 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.110
 gain not only that I win 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.000
 I have to win to win I have 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.940
 what do they give me and that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.030
 philosophy of a delay of that sharing to 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.849
 I liked it that teach 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.700
 to people my people to learn to 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.409
 to teach others that philosophy 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.390
 has liked that why I stayed at 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.099
 principle asked for a license in the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
 university to develop this a 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.220
 shortly after that leave I carry 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.190
 seven years living from omnilife this 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.789
 has led to generate not only 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.400
 personal income but also that my 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.699
 people earn money 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.479
 this has led me to develop a 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.930
 very good organization and organization 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.660
 which is between 20 to 35 percent of 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.360
 discount has led me to that I can 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.030
 travel and know many countries and 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.780
 there have actually been almost nine countries that 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.300
 I have known since 2005 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.700
 people are sometimes impressed and going 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.770
 giving you have to spend a lot of time to 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.950
 that they have is something and other than the eighth 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.350
 half in omnilife since I was in 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.330
 an airplane then they left is our 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.720
 first national trip we made to 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.910
 national level and it really was what there 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.550
 same we started to share the much 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.130
 people this and that is part of our 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.320
 testimony and our gains our 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.630
 success that we have had by the people who 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.450
 has risen from the one that has 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.300
 raised in health and has had the 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.150
 opportunity for God to give more life to 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.200
 Through our nutrient recover 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.200
 your quality of life 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.790
 is good to see that people 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.410
 we are helping people 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.050
 philosophy is good that's why the 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.150
 I share and really our purpose 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.000
 is to help people all there is for 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.530
 we do that and although really what 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 interesting about this is that although to 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.370
 Sometimes people call me that is not read 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.340
 of my organization and with much emotion 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.380
 I really do it because I really 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.170
 I'm grateful that someone once 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.830
 I participated this I like to help 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.740
 the people 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.230
 philosophy I like then I feel 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.330
 that God presents you in addition what 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.330
 other things about travel 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.910
 twice been in Israel the first 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.430
 time on a cruise the Mediterranean coast 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.160
 Throughout the Mediterranean Sea I always 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.750
 I was talking to my students 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.150
 however, he had never been able to 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.890
 contemplate what art was what 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.870
 were to touch those pyramids see those 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.320
 paintings that spoke to us in those 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.330
 great writers back in Italy from 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.800
 those great sculptures this does not 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.010
 allowed this company the university 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.930
 I had never allowed it then 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.510
 for me that's an emotion that sharing 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.150
 and really I feel pretty 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.160
 excited I use all the products of the 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.500
 line one of the first products that 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.080
 I started drinking was the lemon tea and 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.420

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.340
 He does not feel like that because he consumed a lot 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:07.070

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.620
