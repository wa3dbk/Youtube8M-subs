00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello the new ones and today we will talk about the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.050
 membrane membrane to membrane 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.500
 she has this model of the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.049
 mosaic fluid lipoprotein and has a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 bilayer lipid also has this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.750
 plasma White Mother constitution 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 whole and peripheral proteins that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 I'll explain later you keep a 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 balance of the enter and extracellular medium 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 controls the entry and exit of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.700
 substances have a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 selective permeability that they make a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 selection of what goes in and what comes out of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 inside the cytoplasm outward has a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.070
 flexibility because of the cytoskeleton 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.320
 and a very wide regeneration we have the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.270
 oligosaccharides that are the carbohydrates 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 proteins 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.280
 the junction of oligosaccharides with 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
 proteins form glycoproteins that I 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 I'll explain further ahead. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.489
 another glycolipid which is attached to the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.769
 lipid layer that this team part 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 glycolipid flame that the junction of 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.090
 oligosaccharides with the lipid 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.820
 cholesterol in this region 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 peripheral proteins are outside the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.939
 membrane and the integrals are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 membrane and these fibers are 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.850
 cytoskeleton of lipid call because 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.299
 it is a layer of lipid a layer and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.759
 another bilayer layer we will characterize 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:33.000
 part there and there of this bilayer 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 ie hydrophilic head having 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.890
 affinity with water having affinity 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.740
 with water then this part of the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 The ends of the membrane have a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.270
 very great affinity with water. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.119
 parts of the ends of the membrane 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.970
 already the middle of the plasma membrane are 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.820
 these other fragments are lipids 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.340
 he has the hydrophobic tail does not have 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 affinity with the water here we have the vi 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 put only the glycoproteins as me 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.880
 are carbohydrate molecules 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.310
 linked to the protein the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.870
 carbohydrates are these balls in blue 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.480
 and these other filaments are the 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.240
 the carbohydrate junction 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.970
 physician characteristics with proteins 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.250
 that Olympic layer that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.150
 I explained hydrophobic part 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.270
 hydrophilic in zig kokkalis if these 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 glycoproteins has this adhesion and the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.230
 recognition for what they serve 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.810
 these glycoproteins are the rejection of 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 bodies as are an integral part of the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.480
 cells each of its function has nelo 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.940
 and the function of the glycoprotein is to 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.760
 this supervision in the case of 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.970
 organ rejection are these 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.880
 glycoproteins that have the protein 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.940
 she has some proteins have this channel 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.060
 to equilibrate the extracellular medium with 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.140
 and this part of the inter- 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 and I have cytoplasm 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.010
