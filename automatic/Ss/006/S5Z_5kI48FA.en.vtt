00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.980
 hi to all your guys in there 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.140
 I want to talk about this new video 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.189
 a little curiosity though a lot 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.130
 important 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.460
 the accented capital letters you will say 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.950
 you 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.320
 what's so curious and important 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.720
 in accented capital letters the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.759
 fact that few people know how to do it e 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.470
 they underestimate its importance 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.630
 imagine having to write a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.530
 curriculum a document or an e-mail from 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.360
 work 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.860
 many people after the point if they have to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.059
 start with a capital letter 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.059
 accepted 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.179
 for example the and what they do write her 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.070
 it's tiny accented is wrong after 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.149
 the point always goes to the letter 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.079
 capital 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.600
 so what they do is capitalize 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.999
 emit near the apostrophe to stay at 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.230
 symbolize the accent also this is 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.149
 mistaken 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.920
 there are codes that if you type 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.950
 on keyboards allow us to write 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.050
 the accented capital letters are 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.150
 very important in the workplace in 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.460
 how much grammar and spelling are 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.320
 fundamental and also to avoid 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 cripple the Italian language 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.480
 to shortly on the desktop with the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 explanation well guys here we are on 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.210
 desktop 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.120
 then let's see immediately how to write 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.910
 the capitalized accented letters I created 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.290
 here this small text document 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.900
 where the various letters are written 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.970
 stressed in this case the vowels with i 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.880
 various types of acute severe accent 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.580
 circumflex the diaeresis and other types of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.650
 accent that we do not use near us 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 each of these letters has a code 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:49.360
 for example, the stressed e-mail will be there 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 there is the code 02 00 what is this 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.540
 code 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.490
 this code allows us to write the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 and capitalized accent 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.460
 let's see how it works we have to use the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.470
 keyboard side keypad e 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.080
 tonight numerical here beside not 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.009
 this one above but this then 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.280
 we hold out and press 02 00 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.870
 we leave alt and as you can see there appears the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.719
 and accented capital letters on laptops is a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.480
 bit different because instead of just doing 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:25.310
 halt 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.549
 200 we should do the most fn fn a 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.400
 key located next to the key 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.890
 alt and not seen that we do not have the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.310
 numeric keypad on the right 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.540
 we will have to use a numeric keypad 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 hidden inside the keyboard 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.650
 main what it means 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.599
 the only mjkl keys 7 8:09 by side 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.470
 have small numbers written in 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.650
 purple or blue and the number zero gen 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.579
 number 1 k the number 2 and number 3 and so 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.470
 Street 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:02.780
 we will therefore do at the most fn and pray 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.650
 mk mm so we actually pressed 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.109
 02 00 me if I do it on the fixed not 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.019
 nothing happens because I have the keypad 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.129
 numeric on the side on laptops yes 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.900
 does so 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.150
 you must use these numbers as they are 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.760
 written next to these letters 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.250
 I repeat the m the number zero the hagi the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.150
 number 1 k2 and so on until you arrive 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 to the number 9 good with regard to 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.889
 capitalized accented letters is everything 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.290
 I repeat on the fixed out and keypad 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:36.349
 numerical here on the right for laptops 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.160
 alt plus the fn key plus the numbers there 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.139
 mgk l upi or are written on these keys 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.540
 7 8 and 9 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.000
 you can safely mark this 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.620
 list of accented letters referee 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.489
 the ones you use most personally 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.380
 I use a lot the stressed nothing 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.000
 I hope I have been helpful I hope that 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.500
 the video you enjoyed we peck at 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.500
 next video bye bye
