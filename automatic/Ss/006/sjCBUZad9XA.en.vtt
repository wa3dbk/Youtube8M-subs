00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
bareback essentially what's kind of

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.299 
bareback essentially what's kind of
awesome<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.140> our<00:00:50.559> Kairosoft<00:00:51.070> in

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
awesome is that our Kairosoft in

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.640 
awesome is that our Kairosoft in
california<00:00:51.910> has<00:00:52.540> essentially<00:00:53.050> combined<00:00:53.470> the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
california has essentially combined the

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.470 
california has essentially combined the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.960 
real quick obviously you can see I'm
using<00:00:56.770> it<00:00:57.100> more<00:00:57.220> than<00:00:57.430> in<00:00:57.550> dead<00:00:57.790> back

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
using it more than in dead back

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.580 
using it more than in dead back
functionality<00:00:58.480> right<00:00:58.630> there<00:00:58.810> but<00:00:59.320> as<00:00:59.410> you<00:00:59.470> can

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
functionality right there but as you can

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.470 
functionality right there but as you can
see<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.190> have<00:01:00.310> this<00:01:00.430> extra<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:01.180> know<00:01:01.240> piece

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
see you have this extra you know piece

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.420 
see you have this extra you know piece
here<00:01:01.750> that<00:01:01.900> you<00:01:02.800> can<00:01:02.920> actually<00:01:03.040> write<00:01:03.310> your

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
here that you can actually write your

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.620 
here that you can actually write your
name<00:01:03.579> on<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.030> know<00:01:04.239> people<00:01:04.479> lose<00:01:04.600> their

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
name on it so you know people lose their

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.540 
name on it so you know people lose their
barrel<00:01:05.050> bags<00:01:05.229> all<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.530> time<00:01:05.710> but<00:01:06.280> with<00:01:06.400> this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
barrel bags all the time but with this

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.800 
barrel bags all the time but with this
you<00:01:06.610> can<00:01:06.759> actually<00:01:07.090> write<00:01:07.240> your<00:01:07.390> name<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.570> it

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
you can actually write your name on it

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.840 
you can actually write your name on it
it's<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.229> way<00:01:08.380> even<00:01:09.130> if<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.280> lose<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:09.610> they

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
it's that way even if you lose it they

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.280 
it's that way even if you lose it they
can<00:01:10.030> still<00:01:10.240> tell<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.540> yours<00:01:10.750> and<00:01:10.840> because

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
can still tell it's yours and because

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.510 
can still tell it's yours and because
it's<00:01:11.530> got<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.740> little<00:01:11.979> bit<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.160> length<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.490> it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
it's got a little bit of length to it

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.249 
it's got a little bit of length to it
you<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.210> essentially<00:01:13.479> use<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.869> like<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:13.990> dead

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
you can essentially use it like a dead

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.980 
you can essentially use it like a dead
rat<00:01:14.440> what's<00:01:15.399> also<00:01:15.550> great<00:01:16.060> event<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.479> stick

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
rat what's also great event is stick

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.450 
rat what's also great event is stick
around<00:01:17.170> corners<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.680> wave<00:01:17.830> around<00:01:17.860> corners<00:01:18.369> or

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
around corners to wave around corners or

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.859 
around corners to wave around corners or
whatever<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.360> way<00:01:19.479> you<00:01:19.570> can<00:01:19.690> kind<00:01:19.840> of

this onto a helmet or something like

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.810 
this onto a helmet or something like
that<00:01:26.410> already<00:01:27.190> can<00:01:27.310> loop<00:01:27.430> around<00:01:27.580> your<00:01:27.729> arm

that already can loop around your arm
one<00:01:28.810> thing<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.080> think<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.409> would<00:01:29.530> would<00:01:29.799> be

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
one thing I think that would would be

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.560 
one thing I think that would would be
kind<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.220> cool<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.640> they<00:01:30.850> added<00:01:31.150> hook<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.510> loop

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
kind of cool is they added hook and loop

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.469 
kind of cool is they added hook and loop
one<00:01:31.750> velcro<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.620> like<00:01:33.220> on<00:01:33.460> one<00:01:33.880> side<00:01:34.180> at<00:01:34.450> least

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
one velcro I like on one side at least

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.539 
one velcro I like on one side at least
one<00:01:34.810> side<00:01:35.049> on<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.350> red<00:01:35.530> would<00:01:35.950> be<00:01:36.130> really<00:01:36.280> cool

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
one side on the red would be really cool

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.969 
one side on the red would be really cool
that<00:01:37.090> way<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.299> can<00:01:37.540> velcro<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.290> on<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.830> like

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
that way you can velcro it on the like

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.070 
that way you can velcro it on the like
parts<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.369> your<00:01:39.490> body<00:01:39.610> on<00:01:40.210> your<00:01:40.390> helmet<00:01:40.540> or

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
something like that but what is nice is

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.730 
something like that but what is nice is

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.660 
tends to fall off they don't realize it
and<00:01:52.960> they<00:01:53.110> get<00:01:53.229> over<00:01:53.500> shot<00:01:53.710> again<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:54.549> is

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
and they get over shot again but this is

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.429 
and they get over shot again but this is
definitely<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:55.090> really<00:01:55.450> cool<00:01:55.630> item<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.320> was

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
using it pretty much all day and it's

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.850 
using it pretty much all day and it's
really<00:01:58.360> effective<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.020> like<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.260> said<00:01:59.320> you<00:01:59.830> can

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860

really effective and like I said you can
even<00:02:00.100> put<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.460> on<00:02:00.610> your<00:02:00.700> weapon<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.479> you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
even put this on your weapon so you

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.359 
even put this on your weapon so you
already<00:02:02.080> have<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> safety<00:02:02.560> factor<00:02:02.830> going<00:02:03.250> on

and<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:04.510> can<00:02:04.659> kind<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.900> stick<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.260> out<00:02:05.439> from

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
and you can kind of stick it out from

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.800 
and you can kind of stick it out from
behind<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:06.070> corner<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.549> not<00:02:07.150> get<00:02:07.330> shot<00:02:07.600> when
