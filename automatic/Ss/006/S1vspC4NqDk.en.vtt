00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.620
 about us 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.210
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.820
 circle tv and today we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.739
 a car like a leopard and look at 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.980
 one fight where my opponents were 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.900
 pretty stupid and see at the end of the fight 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.699
 what will be the score all the same but 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.949
 principle is not uncommon opponents 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.379
 there are different and fights therefore too 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.660
 It turns out different but we are not talking about 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.820
 This lets a little and leopard 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.800
 the first will probably be the second video 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.140
 because here I had him not yet 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.659
 top I did not have top shells 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.269
 yes and in general the leopard did not seem to me 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.519
 some kind of super interesting machine he has 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.869
 there are both pluses and big ones 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.330
 big cons 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:06.640
 let's consider the pros and that 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.810
 can be attributed to this of course this 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.510
 margin of 1571 units is a lot 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.909
 this completely allows us to endure 3 4 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.130
 hits but from small-caliber guns I 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.470
 generally keep quiet but the problem is that 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.540
 let's say 60 four small-caliber 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.270
 guns punch well, very good 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.399
 she is light and even in the forehead again 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.619
 go a little to the minuses and immediately 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.409
 I will say that good is not on the leopard 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.240
 sometimes bounce sometimes happens 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.340
 it is so rare that 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.890
 your place I would hope for it not 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 became and once again did not substitute myself 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.859
 because one-time damage uas less than 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 our main competitor t-64 order 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.899
 300 units of subcibber is a bit of it 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.179
 quite a bit because there even 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.310
 less than 300 units and you understand 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.869
 that the alpha is exchanged and will 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.299
 absolutely not our method 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.229
 but what do we get for instead 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.719
 good 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.789
 damage is given to us accuracy accuracy 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.380
 guns probably probably one of 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.899
 top four 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.270
 but sometimes you know about even she does not save 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.180
 us and sometimes even with such precision we 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.069
 we do not fall so doubtful at the same time 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.900
 what is more noticeable is that the instrument 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.060
 goes down well 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.890
 the angle of inclination of the gun down wonderful 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.040
 and it allows us to occupy such 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.830
 positions from where the t-64 would generally shoot 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.140
 I could not but or t-62 t-72 here already 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.819
 it doesn't really matter for everyone 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.330
 good declination angles here with us 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.010
 pretty good however it is not questioning 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.380
 changing to shooting back there with us 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.230
 engine compartment and there the guns down not 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.240
 leans almost well no way so 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.890
 all the time we shoot only forward as 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.570
 it says only to attack 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.250
 best on this machine of course 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.560
 stand somewhere far far behind 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.500
 its allies because it glows 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.690
 good body huge body tall and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.620
 Of course the car makes its way easily and 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.990
 at ease 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 so the damage we absorb is wonderful 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.430
 well and shine us too well so on 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.290
 the first line to climb is absolutely not ours 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 option we shoot off from behind 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.820
 allies like me in this fight of course i'm here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
 once substituted but it does not matter 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.350
 the important thing is that they don't shoot for me, but I 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.840
 I shoot at opponents I punch them and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.090
 cause any damage to drag on 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.830
 this car is incredibly difficult I would 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 said that we have done for this not 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.490
 fits and if we feel still 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.920
 more or less comfortable among 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.959
 classmates and fifth levels then 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.970
 getting into battle with the sixth sevens we 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.040
 just meat because it kills us 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.110
 generally easy 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.450
 we shine well while we ourselves do not 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.190
 so much can we do to ours 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.160
 the opponent of breaking through is not to say 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.500
 mega huge about 270 millimeters 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.390
 one-time damage compared to the sixth 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.610
 seventh just miserable 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.709
 yes and no advantage against us 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.260
 they certainly do not have well except ours 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.480
 number hp one and a half thousand but it is not 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.340
 so much believe me they can 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.640
 fly away in just a few seconds 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.959
 if you do something wrong 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.390
 main tactic of course on this one 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.730
 car is to stand somewhere in the back and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.040
 engage in such a game in the floor pt 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.650
 mobility we unfortunately such as 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.930
 at lav 300 we have no car 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.090
 not really much more mobile t 64 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.780
 exceeds it except that in the maximum 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.239
 speeds 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.979
 therefore, a dubious advantage too 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.600
 in front of our classmates it's in 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.729
 maximum speed we realize 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.560
 probably even can not but 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.050
 at least from the slide we can from someone 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.060
 escape it sometimes you can take advantage 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.979
 however, going back to tactics you can 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.050
 say that only the second line to us and 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.419
 Comes forward we can not climb 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.360
 categorically and otherwise we will immediately get 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.940
 on the nuts and quickly die we go out into the hangar and 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.660
 there will be sad Well as you were 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.400
 crew gt 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.680
 This is such a first look at a leopard 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.370
 It will be more videos and still see 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.370
 for now
