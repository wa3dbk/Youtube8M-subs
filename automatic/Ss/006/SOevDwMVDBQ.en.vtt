00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi guys, I'm Vegard and in todays video you're going to learn about

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.940
the four main types of classic socks that we have,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.040
- how to always pick the right colour of socks for your outfit

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.440
- and the rule for matching the correct sock type with your shoe type.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.940
There's basically four types of classic socks:

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.540
- the first type out is the liner sock, or invisible sock as some call it.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.100
- next we have tube socks, which are also called tennis socks.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.120
- we have the quite unusual over the calf socks.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.340
- and the last type is off course the very common dress sock.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.220
In this video we're going to start with liner socks.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.120
These are basically socks that you'd wear inside low build shoes like loafers, sneakers or boat shoes.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.900
These socks are for a number of reasons a good alternative to going sockless,

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.289
- which is a renowned casual look.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.889
First: the fabric in these socks helps prevent chafing blisters

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.300
- which is a common problem in shoes that rub against your heels or toes.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.340
Second: the fabric also helps your feet breathe on warm summer days 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.799
- and thus preventing foot odour to some degree.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.049
These socks are also great for men who are self conscious about their toes,

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.140
- because they will cover your toe and heel, if you have to take your shoes of in front of others during the day.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.680
These socks by the way, they are considered super casual

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.740
- and that's because showing bare leg on any sort of formal occasion is considered inappropriate.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.240
That's why you wear liner socks only on occasions

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.538
- where it's appropriate to wear shorts, or summer pants.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.800
These socks are great. I love them because they're dirt cheap,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.640
- they are comfortable and unlike many ankle socks,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.380
- they don't slid down under your heel when you're exercising.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.600
Tube socks are, if possible, even more casual than liner socks

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.370
- and that's mainly because it's a sports garment.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.160
As we know, sports garments should only be worn to the gym, or when we're wearing trainers, 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.560
- but we're going to talk more about that later in this video.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.690
A good pair of tube socks should have a wide elastic band,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.280
- they should also be fairly long, as most of them are one size fits all.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.760
In addition to that, they should have a thick high-grade cotton fabric,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.080
- which will provide for some shock absorption when active.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.970
The third type of classic socks are called over the calf socks,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.110
- mainly because that's what they do, they do go over the calf.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.150
I believe that these socks are developed for super formal occasions,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.340
- where showing your legs are way inappropriate.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.020
The reason for this is that even when your sitting down and your pants slide up, they will cover you leg.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.000
These over the calf socks are bought solely for this video

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.301
- and that's because I avoid this dilemma all together by wearing shirt stays

00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.680
- that clasps on to my shirt and socks.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.140
Thereby my legs are kept out of sight, all through the day, no matter what.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.299
If you, by the way, would like to learn more about shirt stays like the ones I'm wearing,

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.900
- you can check out my shirt stays tutorial by clicking the link on screen,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.340
- or down below this video now!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.960
The last of the four types of classic socks are these and they are dress socks.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.680
Dress socks are socks I basically use every day, with all kinds of casual and formal pants.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.100
Dress socks, like most other socks, typically come in both plain weave and ribbed weave.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.940
Personally I prefer plain weave dress socks, because they look more formal that ribbed weave dress socks.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.420
I can still use my plain weave dress socks to casual occasions without a hitch.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.920
These dress socks are obviously black, but I do have them in several other solid colours as well.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.060
The rule that helps me decide what colour socks I should choose for a specific outfit,

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.180
- is what we're going to talk about next.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.600
Here is the super easy and classic way of deciding what colours your socks should have.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.100
The rule is simply to wear socks in a solid colour, that's similar to that of your pants

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.960
- and here, the key word is similar.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.320
With my black dress socks, I simply wear all my black and navy blue dress pants,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320
- as well as my dark and black jeans.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.200
With light grey and grey pants, I use grey socks like these.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.220
If i'm wearing a pair of khaki coloured cargo pants like these,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.300
- I'll probably opt-in for a pair of beige socks like these.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.140
Next we are going to look at how to pick the right type of socks,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.100
- depending on what kind of shoes we're wearing.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.300
To make it easy for myself, I've divided shoes into three different categories

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.200
- and I only use one type of socks for each category.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.320
The categories are: semi formal and formal shoes and boots.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.690
Which I always use dress socks for.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.940
The second category is casual shoes and for that category I always choose liner socks,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.040
-  if I don't choose to go sockless.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.600
Lastly we have athletic shoes like trainers and for those I always use tube socks.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.420
For me a semi formal and formal shoe and boot, is anything from sneakers to boots.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.280
Basically all types of shoes I would wear dress socks with are:

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.600
Sneakers like these.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.140
Open or closed lacing leather shoes like these.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.680
All types of casual and formal boots.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.110
Next up are casual shoes.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.170
When I say casual shoes I basically mean shoes that are mainly used for leisure activities.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.860
Classic examples of casual shoes that I would use either liner socks, or go sockless in, are:

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.500
Loafer like these.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.160
Boat shoes.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.720
And off course, sneakers.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.960
You may have noticed that sneakers are in both the dress socks and the liner socks category

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.400
What kind of socks you're wearing with sneakers, really depend on what kind of bottoms you're wearing.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.680
If I'm wearing shorts, I would go for liner socks,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.990
- however if I'm wearing jeans or a casual pair of dress pants,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.160
- I would definitively go for dress socks.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.500
As you also may have noticed, sandals aren't represented in this category

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.760
- and that's because sandals, with their open toe designs, really don't permit the use of socks.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.170
That basically means, no socks when you're wearing sandals.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.639
The last of the three categories of shoes, are athletic shoes.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.339
As I've already said, tube socks should only be worn with shoes intended for sports.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.640
