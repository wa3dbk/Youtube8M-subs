spice the game one thing that did

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.229 
spice the game one thing that did
disappoint<00:02:14.280> me<00:02:14.370> though<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.970> didn't

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
disappoint me though is that they didn't

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.750 
disappoint me though is that they didn't
have<00:02:15.390> any<00:02:15.570> faces<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.070> drivers<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.700> know

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
have any faces on the drivers and I know

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.069 
have any faces on the drivers and I know
that<00:02:18.000> doesn't<00:02:18.180> mean<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:18.780> won't<00:02:18.930> be

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
that doesn't mean that there won't be

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.680 
that doesn't mean that there won't be
actual<00:02:19.739> faces<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.549> game<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.510> would

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
actual faces in the game but I would

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.509 
actual faces in the game but I would
think<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.049> if<00:02:22.170> Codemasters<00:02:22.860> did<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.310> them

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
think that if Codemasters did have them

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.610 
think that if Codemasters did have them
developed<00:02:24.090> they'd<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> trailer

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
developed they'd be here in this trailer

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
developed they'd be here in this trailer
and<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.310> lot<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.489> people<00:02:26.820> been<00:02:26.910> saying<00:02:27.239> for

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and a lot of people been saying for

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.289 
and a lot of people been saying for
years<00:02:27.690> get<00:02:28.410> actual<00:02:28.980> facial<00:02:29.579> features<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.090> able

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
years get actual facial features be able

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.910 
years get actual facial features be able
to<00:02:30.359> recognize<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> driver<00:02:31.049> besides<00:02:31.590> skin

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
to recognize the driver besides skin

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
to recognize the driver besides skin
tone<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> little<00:02:33.540> bit

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
tone so that's a little bit

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.080 
tone so that's a little bit
disappointing<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.130> maybe<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.850> their

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
disappointing and maybe it's that their

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.060 
disappointing and maybe it's that their

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
from doing that I don't know but it's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.170 
from doing that I don't know but it's
not<00:02:40.680> gonna<00:02:40.829> be<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.190> there<00:02:41.310> most<00:02:41.549> likely<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
not gonna be in there most likely and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.970 
not gonna be in there most likely and
that's<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.510> little<00:02:42.660> sad<00:02:42.930> another<00:02:43.650> thing<00:02:43.890> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that's a little sad another thing I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.470 
that's a little sad another thing I
noticed<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.489> that<00:02:44.549> there<00:02:44.880> was<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.090> large

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
noticed was that there was a large

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
noticed was that there was a large
variety<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:46.200> pitstop<00:02:46.980> animations<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
variety of pitstop animations in the

scared me and I know that it's a little

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.040 
scared me and I know that it's a little
pathetic<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.909> really<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> small<00:03:12.599> detail

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
at least tell that the crowds moving and

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.320 
at least tell that the crowds moving and
that<00:03:29.250> they're<00:03:29.370> cheering<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.300> little

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
that they're cheering on just a little

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.320 
that they're cheering on just a little
bit<00:03:30.690> more<00:03:30.990> if<00:03:31.860> you've<00:03:32.040> seen<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.700> Formula<00:03:33.120> One

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
bit more if you've seen the Formula One

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.540 
bit more if you've seen the Formula One
Silverstone<00:03:33.930> Grand<00:03:34.230> Prix<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.740> year<00:03:35.070> when

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
Silverstone Grand Prix this year when

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.700 
Silverstone Grand Prix this year when
Alonso<00:03:36.000> was<00:03:36.150> fighting<00:03:36.570> with<00:03:36.690> Hamilton<00:03:37.050> you

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
Alonso was fighting with Hamilton you

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.290 
Alonso was fighting with Hamilton you
could<00:03:37.890> hear<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.340> crowd<00:03:38.580> from<00:03:38.760> inside<00:03:39.180> the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
could hear the crowd from inside the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.580 
could hear the crowd from inside the
cockpit<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> think<00:03:40.020> that<00:03:40.140> would<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.320> be

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
cockpit and I think that would just be

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.640 
cockpit and I think that would just be
like<00:03:40.740> an<00:03:40.830> amazing<00:03:41.070> feeling<00:03:41.640> for<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.120> player

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
like an amazing feeling for the player

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.980 
like an amazing feeling for the player
so<00:03:43.650> I'm<00:03:44.370> sure<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.910> crowd<00:03:45.150> Audio<00:03:45.630> can

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
so I'm sure that the crowd Audio can

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.949 
so I'm sure that the crowd Audio can
change<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.970> looked<00:03:48.450> pretty<00:03:48.660> boring

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
change but it just looked pretty boring

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.620 
change but it just looked pretty boring
from<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.650> from<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.490> crowds<00:03:50.730> perspective<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
from the from the crowds perspective and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.570 
from the from the crowds perspective and
you<00:03:52.140> know<00:03:52.170> hopefully<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:53.220> won't<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.550> that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
you know hopefully it won't be that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.449 
you know hopefully it won't be that
boring<00:03:54.180> from<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.959> couch<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.709> that's<00:03:56.280> pretty

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
boring from the couch so that's pretty

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.400 
boring from the couch so that's pretty
much<00:03:56.580> all<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.910> have<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.180> say<00:03:57.209> about<00:03:57.990> this
