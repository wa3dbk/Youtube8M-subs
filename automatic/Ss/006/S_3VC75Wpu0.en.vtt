00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.850
 why chose them about multivalve with 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 gas control electromagnet 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.000
 valve but did not touch the topic of electronics 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 left last and so now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.090
 terminal settings for connection to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 to the posting unit itself and since 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.189
 budget option is there a connection 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.200

 although on the other hand usually 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.369
 used more glass nozzles 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.960
 and how would they be acceptable for Japanese 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.610
 machines savanna fits their account 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.320
 to cut off 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.909
