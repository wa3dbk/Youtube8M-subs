that's<00:02:00.869> usually<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> Cisco<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:03.049> but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
that's usually on the Cisco side but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
that's usually on the Cisco side but
virtual<00:02:04.950> online<00:02:05.250> questions<00:02:05.820> are<00:02:05.939> becoming

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
virtual online questions are becoming

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.619 
virtual online questions are becoming
very<00:02:06.540> popular<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.940> makes<00:02:08.940> sure<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
very popular it really makes sure that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.180 
very popular it really makes sure that
you<00:02:09.780> understand

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you understand

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
you understand
the<00:02:11.430> principles<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.180> configuration<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the principles of configuration of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
the principles of configuration of
similar<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.100> technology<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.630> next<00:02:15.810> one

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
similar of the technology the next one

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.480 
similar of the technology the next one
I'd<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.170> talk<00:02:16.350> about<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> network

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
I'd like to talk about is the network

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.380 
I'd like to talk about is the network
plus<00:02:17.790> getting<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> A+<00:02:18.960> certified<00:02:20.120> cert<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
plus getting the A+ certified cert and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.270 
plus getting the A+ certified cert and
then<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.170> would<00:02:22.380> say<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> second<00:02:23.220> one

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
then going I would say the second one

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.860 
then going I would say the second one
bird<00:02:23.520> probably<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.910> network<00:02:24.210> plus<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.750> need

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bird probably the network plus you need

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
bird probably the network plus you need
to<00:02:24.960> really<00:02:25.140> understand<00:02:25.530> computer<00:02:26.010> technology

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
to really understand computer technology

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.160 
to really understand computer technology
and<00:02:26.850> then<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.150> owners<00:02:27.360> need<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.720> understand

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and then you owners need to understand

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530 
and then you owners need to understand
the<00:02:28.290> networking<00:02:28.620> side<00:02:29.040> how<00:02:29.880> those<00:02:30.090> computers

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
the networking side how those computers

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420 
the networking side how those computers
are<00:02:30.780> connected<00:02:30.930> together<00:02:31.290> how<00:02:32.250> they

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
are connected together how they

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.180 
are connected together how they
communicate<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.470> takes<00:02:34.740> what<00:02:35.040> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
communicate what it takes what the

this<00:03:09.900> starts<00:03:10.740> off<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.070> first<00:03:11.310> semester

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this starts off the first semester

this starts off the first semester
pretty<00:03:12.930> much<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.440> quick<00:03:13.770> review<00:03:14.100> of<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
pretty much just a quick review of the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
second semester is real heavy on

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.090 
second semester is real heavy on
networking<00:03:21.260> then<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> third<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:22.890> fourth

here<00:05:27.159> the<00:05:27.550> first<00:05:27.789> two<00:05:28.210> search<00:05:28.630> that<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:28.930> would

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
here the first two search that I would

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.960 
here the first two search that I would
recommend<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.650> A+<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.520> network<00:05:30.759> plus

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.339 
recommend is the A+ and the network plus
and<00:05:31.240> again<00:05:31.780> these<00:05:31.900> are<00:05:32.080> pretty<00:05:32.259> much

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
and again these are pretty much

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.749

at any DoD installation and they usually

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.379 
at any DoD installation and they usually
start<00:05:52.990> at<00:05:53.409> about<00:05:53.500> sixty<00:05:54.039> thousand<00:05:54.490> so<00:05:55.150> just

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
start at about sixty thousand so just

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:57.779 
start at about sixty thousand so just
these<00:05:55.570> three<00:05:55.960> certs<00:05:56.259> can<00:05:56.590> get<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.979> started<00:05:57.520> at

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
these three certs can get you started at

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.390 
these three certs can get you started at

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
the left side here starting off with the

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.709 
the left side here starting off with the
CCNA<00:06:02.139> and<00:06:02.469> then<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.680> CC<00:06:03.009> and<00:06:03.190> p2<00:06:04.000> professional

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.620 
CCNA and then the CC and p2 professional
and<00:06:04.990> then<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.550> CCI<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:06.729> hear<00:06:07.060> at<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.270> bottom

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
and then the CCI you hear at the bottom

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.740 
and then the CCI you hear at the bottom
is<00:06:07.750> cisco<00:06:08.080> security<00:06:09.060> which<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.509> should

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
is cisco security which you should

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.719 
is cisco security which you should
pursue<00:06:10.990> after<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.530> CCNP<00:06:12.190> or<00:06:12.340> even<00:06:12.580> before

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
pursue after the CCNP or even before

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.070 
pursue after the CCNP or even before
again<00:06:13.659> it's<00:06:13.810> very<00:06:14.169> highly<00:06:15.070> regarded<00:06:15.969> and<00:06:16.750> very
