00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
knife because the blades more
specialized<00:01:55.079> than<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
specialized than that this is just

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.399 
specialized than that this is just
technically<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.420> box<00:01:57.689> cutter<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.200> put

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
technically a like box cutter and I put

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
technically a like box cutter and I put
a<00:01:58.439> smaller<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.610> I'll<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.969> use<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.210> for

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
a smaller one so I'll just use that for

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
a smaller one so I'll just use that for
the<00:02:01.020> wallet<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.979> could<00:02:02.219> take<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> blades

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the wallet so I could take the blades

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
the wallet so I could take the blades
and<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.119> won't<00:02:03.240> cost<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.719> money<00:02:03.840> cuz

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and it won't cost a lot of money cuz

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399 
and it won't cost a lot of money cuz
look<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> dollar<00:02:05.280> look<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.570> many<00:02:06.750> blades<00:02:07.049> I
