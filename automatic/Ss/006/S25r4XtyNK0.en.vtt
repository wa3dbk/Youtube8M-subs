00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 Uh, we have a lot of subconscious things that we do not know . 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.099
 I prepared a sample in front of me. 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.780
 However, if you have 2 cups of rice cake and 30g of sugar 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 Sugar is 30 rock 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.740
 Oh, hello. Yes. So what do you think we should eat once a day? 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 I am now addicted to sugar, so I do not know about myself, 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.650
 If you choose 4 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 Except when they pick Blast food because sugar is called Hey sound settings 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 So you're going to eat elasticity all day. 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.840
 Well, I thought I did not really like the crops . 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.840
 I can not stand it. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:48.370
 So I'm a little sugar-poor, so it's not too late to be yellow sugar . 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:52.570
 Sometimes it's okay to go to Gomum. Now we know some of us. 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:57.010
 Those who have studied about my 5-year-old daughter know that refined sugar 2 is bad. 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:01.000
 I'm a sugar refiner and Nicole White sometimes thinks like this. 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.379
 So now this is why now is the sugar and the sugar in the market is second-hand 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 You can set the rack or dab yourself in the plum or eat it . 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.160
 It's a little bad when you use it. 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.179
 There are a lot of 4 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.920
 It's called blindfolded eyes. 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:26.229
 Now it has completely come out of the original sugar cane to the jolyeo 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.729
 It is still brown sugar, but the protection that comes out of the boil , 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:34.590
 This could be an economy that I would like to wear more than 1 , 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.590
 This is now the land of the massacre. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:47.229
 Above 3 is both contemporary collections ah 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.599
 There is a phase of making Lee Jung-jae sugar, which is now a non-refined sugar FSS 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.819
 That 's what they call it. 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:56.150
 Extracted from sugar cane juice that has a thick so it was processing the raw sugar 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.720
 Ah 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.860
 Oh, this also haves now I'm brown color 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.110
 Part gardening this is a bit difficult, such as the ones you see'm okay to lock yaeman 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.940
 Yogeo did get right is healed 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:17.120
 He's sugar, sugar, because it's in a state before it's refined. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:21.800
 Oh, not just the taste is another expression geodun I saw ttokgatahyo sweetness to eat inside the room 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.720
 He does it because once it is refined dame status because unrefined sugar 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.500
 It's a bit sweet. 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.220
 And because they are not refined, they contain minerals and vitamins. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 I have it 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.670
 And this is something dignified sugar 4, but the absolute amount is much talk 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.980
 You can not. 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:44.000
 When I eat sugar, various minerals are trumpeted and used again to give him 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:48.740
 In the case of two of them, because there are a small amount of essentials in the US , 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.150
 It's less damaging. In the past, the southern US or South Africa's sugarcane 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:56.060
 There were so many farms. 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.870
 But that black slaves were re-defined in order to take advantage of sugarcane themselves cooking 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.150
 Ra 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:05.239
 But there are farmers by refining the sugar cane urine with sugar 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.920
 Hammer did it. What difference does it make? 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.290
 Is kind are concerned, I do not have diabetes, we often speak of Los Angeles Righteous Army slaves what 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:19.430
 Farmers who ate it like sugar in tablets 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:24.470
 This is the plague of illnesses Dodong iteoyom this mean haetdan So this 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.330
 Even if it comes naturally just as non-refined sugar , 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:34.000
 As will be based for refined sugar as well as someone inside lock minerals that ah 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.000
 So this is looking for obvious health
