there<00:01:23.960> are<00:01:24.170> 45<00:01:24.950> different<00:01:25.400> kinesin<00:01:26.390> genes<00:01:26.660> and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
there are 45 different kinesin genes and

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800 
there are 45 different kinesin genes and
the<00:01:26.990> reason<00:01:27.440> why<00:01:27.620> there's<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.040> many<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.810> that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the reason why there's so many is that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.780 
the reason why there's so many is that
these<00:01:30.020> different<00:01:30.230> kinesins<00:01:30.920> are<00:01:31.100> specialized

for<00:01:32.120> different<00:01:32.150> types<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.930> transport

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
for different types of transport

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100 
for different types of transport
activities<00:01:34.070> that's<00:01:34.430> why<00:01:34.720> there's<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:35.870> many<00:01:35.960> of

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
activities that's why there's so many of

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.200 
activities that's why there's so many of
these<00:01:36.200> kinesins<00:01:36.770> because<00:01:37.160> they<00:01:37.700> perform<00:01:38.120> a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
these kinesins because they perform a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.680 
these kinesins because they perform a
whole<00:01:38.450> variety<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:39.110> different<00:01:39.680> kinds<00:01:40.460> of

as<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.639> showed<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.299> an<00:02:11.420> earlier<00:02:11.780> movie<00:02:12.019> from

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
as I showed you in an earlier movie from

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.030 
as I showed you in an earlier movie from
Drosophila<00:02:13.489> embryo

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
Drosophila embryo

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
Drosophila embryo
and<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.760> moving<00:02:14.989> chromosomes<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.200> well<00:02:17.780> and

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and in moving chromosomes as well and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.559 
and in moving chromosomes as well and
these<00:02:19.319> many<00:02:19.620> kinesins<00:02:20.299> actually<00:02:21.299> have<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
these many kinesins actually have a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.479 
these many kinesins actually have a
variety<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.260> different<00:02:22.439> architectures<00:02:23.280> they

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
variety of different architectures they

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.550 
variety of different architectures they
they<00:02:23.879> have<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> similar<00:02:24.450> motor<00:02:24.840> domain<00:02:25.109> here

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
they have a similar motor domain here

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.740 
they have a similar motor domain here
shown<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.950> blue<00:02:26.189> but<00:02:26.879> if<00:02:26.969> you<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.209> scan<00:02:27.510> at

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
shown in blue but if you just scan at

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.959 
shown in blue but if you just scan at
this<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.140> tail<00:02:28.439> domains<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.250> these<00:02:29.370> kinesins

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
this the tail domains of these kinesins

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.789 
this the tail domains of these kinesins
all<00:02:30.269> look<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.510> different<00:02:31.170> from<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.470> another

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
all look very different from one another

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.830 
all look very different from one another
and<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.700> allows<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.269> attach<00:02:33.599> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and that allows them to attach to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.869 
and that allows them to attach to
different<00:02:34.140> cargos<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.010> also<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.519> regulated

different cargos and also be regulated

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.569 
different cargos and also be regulated
in<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.510> number<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> different<00:02:37.109> ways<00:02:37.470> inside<00:02:38.430> of
