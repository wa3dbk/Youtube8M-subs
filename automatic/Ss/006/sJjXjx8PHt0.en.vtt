00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello I was shopping at hofer and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.000
 they have the salsa again this year 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 helios fireworks and I want you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 Let's show what she's all about 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:25.140
 inside is okay so first of all we would have 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.220
 here are two volcanoes im with red and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 green sparks star 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.930
 the m thus the net explosive mass 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.140
 is 4 grams 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:47.039
 yes, I'm just net times 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:49.800
 volcanoes myself piece mini ball 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 bombing to jump with fierce loud 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.329
 silver do not even crackle like that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.329
 bad and the mm is 87 grams 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.530
 then we have a giant here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 I have to say really big of culprits 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 looks alright and the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.250
 So that 's category 2 I have 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 forgive those who say so too 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.659
 which are also category 2 and the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 lokalisten category 1 so category 2 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.299
 and they have a nm of 66 grams 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 that should go off quite happy 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:45.899
 already on it on a crack silver 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.909
 spark of tena again category 2 and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.570
 a nm of eleven grams 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.570
 they are there twice 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:06.940
 jordan here a happiness fontaine 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:10.270
 again left stars with whistles so will 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.170
 be his whistle of the topic like that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.530
 category 2 and 2 5 gram nm is whole 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.860
 nice , i think with nice whistling 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.890
 they'll be back twice then 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.360
 Also there are two times the volcano 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:32.830
 white flashing stars with crackles 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.070
 yes, meanwhile I believed because it was 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.570
 is very bad category 2 and 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.180
 A nrm of 95 grams should be nice 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:49.420
 his 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 then here we have ground flower flower 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:59.519
 surely such three circles yes category 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:04.480
 one so harmless a nm of 56 grams 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.910
 do not know if the mine per article the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.019
 a pretty sure she meant for me 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:16.390
 all for all, so all four one 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:20.019
 nm of 56 came twice the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.690
 already the dancing butterflies are fast 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.330
 I find one of the most blatant parts 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.280
 who are in there because they are 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.769
 The six floor rotors are fountains 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 throw out so it is really blatant 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.830
 the one m is 52 grams and it is 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 category 2 in any case, real 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.989
 I really liked it 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.560
 twice again then twice 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:55.090
 normal pop peas on the extra strong 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:59.040
 hand category 1 0.0 40 grams so not 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.820
 especially strong are always funny 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.440
 Twice 25 pieces are 50 in total so 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.580
 not really 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.250
 link star flashing lights helbling kindes 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.440
 white light per piece are included 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.530
 I thought that was really great last year 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.040
 So a category are 120 gram nm 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.560
 and they are really holds so I found 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:34.590
 Real cool holds then you have here 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:43.810
 two Roman lights each with ten 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:51.930
 balls is the nlm 72 grams per 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:54.790
 light and category 2 then here 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.110
 discoball sven that now sings the 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:02.940
 I think that's what they are 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:06.430
 a nm of 14.4 grams are category 1 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.370
 and I think that's one of the coolest 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.260
 Circling let there is because it is this 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.440
 are the ones I think now again 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.530
 times what I think 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.570
 the were really crass last year so 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:30.790
 are really recommended with and it is 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:36.400
 the party party popper the ultimate 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:40.120
 bang fun an em of 00 90 grams 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.010
 I do not have category one yet 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.510
 really 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.510
 I have no idea what it should be 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:06:05.540
 ah yes, they look like they will 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.910
 this is table fireworks everything is yes 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.920
 super yes so a party fireworks funny 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.920
 I think you can use it inside like that 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.500
 much now I know the bill with 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.340
 as good as snakes or something with 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.080
 be so confetti or something like that 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:32.530
 me is to test ever on the 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:37.900
 sure synonymous a test video then 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.900
 similar to the other fontaine beehive 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.590
 Last year was just as good for me 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.890
 like the other big one has fallen 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.610
 one of 81.7 grams so really one 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:53.660

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.790
 silver spark fontaine just stop 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:04.760
 Gold spark one out of twelve grams and 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.130
 Category 2 is going well 

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.020

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.670
 to the penultimate article pyro circle 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:17.680
