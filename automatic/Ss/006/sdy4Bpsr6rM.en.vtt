such<00:01:16.060> pool<00:01:16.390> go<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.900> probably<00:01:17.530> tips<00:01:18.310> them<00:01:18.460> off

that<00:01:18.880> we<00:01:19.000> have<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.150> leak<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.650> it<00:01:20.770> does<00:01:20.950> but<00:01:21.700> he

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
that we have a leak but it does but he

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.130 
that we have a leak but it does but he
doesn't<00:01:21.940> he's<00:01:22.299> not<00:01:22.330> going<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.570> play<00:01:22.690> around<00:01:22.810> it

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
I think we might just lose this round

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.480 
I think we might just lose this round
two<00:01:28.810> variants<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.500> deck<00:01:29.650> seems<00:01:29.860> very<00:01:30.040> very

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
two variants this deck seems very very

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.770 
two variants this deck seems very very
aggressive<00:01:35.009> mountain<00:01:36.009> planes<00:01:37.470> interesting

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
aggressive mountain planes interesting

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.030 
aggressive mountain planes interesting
yeah

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.610 

doesn't<00:01:43.790> play<00:01:43.910> anything<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.360> saves<00:01:44.570> us<00:01:44.720> why

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
doesn't play anything it saves us why

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.770 
doesn't play anything it saves us why
only<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.310> have<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.580> counter<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.970> oh<00:01:47.210> yeah

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.370 

that<00:01:50.780> card<00:01:51.080> just<00:01:51.260> fix<00:01:51.500> us<00:01:53.170> something<00:01:54.170> we<00:01:54.350> can

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
that card just fix us something we can

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.700 
that card just fix us something we can
play<00:01:56.710> now<00:01:57.710> do<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.370> cycle<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.820> though<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.710> think

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
play now do we cycle that though I think

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.540 
play now do we cycle that though I think
we<00:02:00.860> do<00:02:02.350> we<00:02:03.350> just<00:02:03.380> need<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.710> draw<00:02:03.860> lands<00:02:04.070> protect

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
we do we just need to draw lands protect

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.900 
we do we just need to draw lands protect
dose<00:02:05.920> although<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.100> kind<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.520> counts<00:02:07.760> as<00:02:07.850> a

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
dose although this kind of counts as a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.530 
dose although this kind of counts as a
land<00:02:08.860> only<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:09.920> we<00:02:09.950> draw<00:02:10.190> land<00:02:10.429> though<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:11.510> you

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
land only if we draw land though do you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.960 
land only if we draw land though do you
save<00:02:12.140> our<00:02:12.320> horse<00:02:12.710> you're<00:02:13.520> probably<00:02:13.700> just

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
save our horse you're probably just

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.790 
save our horse you're probably just
going<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.240> kill<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.450> yeah<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.380> don't<00:02:15.530> save<00:02:15.770> our

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
going to kill it yeah we don't save our

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.540 
going to kill it yeah we don't save our
forest<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:22.280> will<00:02:22.400> go

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
forest I think what we do is we will go

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.860 
forest I think what we do is we will go
ahead<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.790> cycle<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.360> because<00:02:23.570> we<00:02:23.660> need<00:02:23.810> to

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
ahead and cycle this because we need to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.850 
ahead and cycle this because we need to
draw<00:02:24.020> lines<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:30.080> draw<00:02:30.110> like<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> lot<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> our<00:02:30.740> elf

anything<00:04:48.790> about<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.690> this<00:04:49.900> the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
anything about that is this the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:02.700 
anything about that is this the
planeswalker<00:04:50.620> okay<00:04:51.510> that's<00:04:52.510> fine

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.280 

yep<00:05:03.710> way<00:05:04.460> too<00:05:04.520> slow

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.180 

we<00:05:11.290> weren't<00:05:11.500> really<00:05:11.620> drawing<00:05:11.980> anything

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
we weren't really drawing anything

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.480 
we weren't really drawing anything
either<00:05:13.470> yeah<00:05:14.470> I'm<00:05:14.530> not<00:05:14.650> sure<00:05:14.800> how<00:05:14.889> else<00:05:15.190> we

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
either yeah I'm not sure how else we

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.860 
either yeah I'm not sure how else we
could<00:05:15.610> have<00:05:15.730> really<00:05:15.940> switched<00:05:16.419> up<00:05:16.540> our<00:05:16.690> deck

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
could have really switched up our deck

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.700 
could have really switched up our deck
like<00:05:17.680> I<00:05:18.060> mean<00:05:19.060> he<00:05:19.180> drew<00:05:19.389> his<00:05:19.600> his<00:05:20.050> mana<00:05:20.320> where<00:05:20.560> r

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
like I mean he drew his his mana where r

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.200 
like I mean he drew his his mana where r
is<00:05:20.740> he<00:05:21.010> good<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.370> he<00:05:21.460> curved<00:05:21.669> out<00:05:21.820> really<00:05:22.060> well

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
is he good and he curved out really well

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.580 
is he good and he curved out really well
so<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:22.750> don't<00:05:22.900> think<00:05:23.020> we<00:05:23.110> really<00:05:23.350> could<00:05:23.560> have

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
so I don't think we really could have

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.200 
so I don't think we really could have
played<00:05:23.770> that<00:05:23.800> differently<00:05:24.220> yeah<00:05:24.669> we<00:05:25.090> could

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
played that differently yeah we could

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.330 
played that differently yeah we could
have<00:05:25.300> kept<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.540> lotus<00:05:25.840> cobra<00:05:25.990> but<00:05:26.889> I<00:05:26.949> don't

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
have kept the lotus cobra but I don't

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
have kept the lotus cobra but I don't
think<00:05:27.460> we<00:05:27.550> were<00:05:27.639> trying<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:27.910> land<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.180> next

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
think we were trying to land the next

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.670 
think we were trying to land the next
turn<00:05:28.479> so<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.750> just<00:05:28.990> cycled<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:29.410> right<00:05:29.530> after

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
turn so it just cycled it right after

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.200 
turn so it just cycled it right after
anyway<00:05:30.900> mm-hmm<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.860> that's<00:05:33.610> probably<00:05:33.910> okay

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
anyway mm-hmm so that's probably okay

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.460 
anyway mm-hmm so that's probably okay
maybe<00:05:34.419> we<00:05:34.570> should<00:05:34.600> have<00:05:34.780> traded<00:05:34.960> with<00:05:35.199> lotus

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
maybe we should have traded with lotus

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.850 
maybe we should have traded with lotus
cobra<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:35.800> can't<00:05:36.160> be<00:05:36.250> right<00:05:36.400> though<00:05:37.860> and

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
cobra that can't be right though and

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.250 
cobra that can't be right though and
we're<00:05:39.010> just<00:05:39.100> dead<00:05:39.310> ok<00:05:39.760> cool<00:05:40.750> well<00:05:41.080> that<00:05:41.169> was

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
we're just dead ok cool well that was

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.170 
we're just dead ok cool well that was
