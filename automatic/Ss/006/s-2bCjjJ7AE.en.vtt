do<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> cup<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> water<00:02:03.810> table<00:02:04.350> spoon<00:02:04.500> out<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.799> I

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
do a cup of water table spoon out so I

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.940 
do a cup of water table spoon out so I
vinegar<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> cup<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> water<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:07.229> mix<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> up

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
vinegar to a cup of water I mix that up

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550 
vinegar to a cup of water I mix that up
the<00:02:08.099> night<00:02:08.250> before<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.840> use<00:02:10.020> one

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the night before that and I can use one

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.760 
the night before that and I can use one
of<00:02:10.590> those<00:02:10.770> things<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.310> about<00:02:11.550> three<00:02:11.790> or<00:02:11.849> four

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
of those things for about three or four

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.620 
of those things for about three or four
is<00:02:12.890> only<00:02:13.040> use<00:02:13.190> about<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.370> quarter<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.480> each

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
is only use about a quarter of it each

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.180 
is only use about a quarter of it each
time<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.290> gives<00:02:15.560> me<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> little<00:02:15.860> bit<00:02:16.070> of

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
time so that gives me a little bit of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.420 
time so that gives me a little bit of
longevity<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.620> putting<00:02:19.310> it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
longevity and then for like putting it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.460 
longevity and then for like putting it
on<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.820> talk<00:02:20.030> about<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.690> rinsing<00:02:21.080> the
