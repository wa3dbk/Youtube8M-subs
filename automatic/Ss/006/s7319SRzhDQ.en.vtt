00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
as well so maybe the the dirty birds I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.960 
as well so maybe the the dirty birds I
can<00:01:03.120> start<00:01:03.359> off<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.750> again<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.850> streak<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
can start off going again on a streak of

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.160 
can start off going again on a streak of
one<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.299> games<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.869> supposed<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
one of these games are not supposed to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
win but all in all for the weeks I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
win but all in all for the weeks I
really<00:01:10.170> wanted<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> pick<00:01:10.619> Carolina<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
game but I think the Giants earlier to
show<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:14.180> I<00:01:15.180> think<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
show up for this one as well I think the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
show up for this one as well I think the
Giants<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> Panthers<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.950> wanted<00:01:17.729> to
