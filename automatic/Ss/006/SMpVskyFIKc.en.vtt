 Outside, it's sunny 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.700
 I want to go see my friends, see my friends 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.000
 Get out of my sleep 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.900
 Come play (play!) 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 Come dance (dance!) 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 Come spear (spear!) 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.200
 Get in the game and take a chance 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
 Go without fear 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 Let yourself go and open your heart 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.900
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.700
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.200
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

 At the park, JosÃ©e tumbles 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.900
 Louis plays hockey 

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:42.000
 Together we fly higher, stronger on the swing 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.300
 We jump, we roll and we laugh 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.700
 Come play (play!)

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.500
 Come on jump (jump!) 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.900
 Come spear (spear!) 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 Get in the game and take a chance 

00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:05.200
 Go without fear 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 Let yourself go and open your heart 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.000
