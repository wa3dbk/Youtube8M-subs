on<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.329> device<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:11.099> it's<00:03:11.790> pretty<00:03:12.090> good<00:03:12.209> at

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
on this device so it's pretty good at

on this device so it's pretty good at
noise<00:03:12.540> cancellation<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.200> did<00:03:13.349> some<00:03:13.500> quick

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
noise cancellation I did some quick

and it performed pretty well inbound
call<00:03:19.230> quality<00:03:19.440> was<00:03:19.650> was<00:03:20.519> quite<00:03:21.389> good<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.549> even

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
call quality was was quite good and even

call quality was was quite good and even
outbound<00:03:24.450> quality<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.560> pretty<00:03:26.010> good<00:03:26.690> with

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
outbound quality was pretty good with

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.479 
outbound quality was pretty good with

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
high levels of noise in the background

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
high levels of noise in the background
and<00:03:29.639> pretty<00:03:29.790> decent<00:03:30.180> when<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.480> was<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
and pretty decent when it was in a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.420 
and pretty decent when it was in a
normal<00:03:31.410> situation<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.010> know<00:03:32.069> regular

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
normal situation you know regular

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.030 
normal situation you know regular
relatively<00:03:33.060> quiet<00:03:33.299> room<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.040> quite

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
relatively quiet room so quite

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.580 
relatively quiet room so quite
comfortable<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.760> was<00:03:35.910> able<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> use<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.959> large

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
comfortable I was able to use the large

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.229 
comfortable I was able to use the large
ear<00:03:37.829> gel<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.250> without<00:03:38.370> using<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.910> ear<00:03:39.030> loop

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
ear gel here without using the ear loop

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.979 
ear gel here without using the ear loop
at<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:39.739> felt<00:03:40.739> quite<00:03:40.950> nice<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> pretty

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
at all felt quite nice it's a pretty

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.690 
at all felt quite nice it's a pretty
light<00:03:43.170> device<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.650> only<00:03:43.799> eight<00:03:44.010> grams<00:03:44.370> heavy

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
light device it's only eight grams heavy

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.160 
light device it's only eight grams heavy
so<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.329> really<00:03:45.600> not<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.900> weigh<00:03:46.019> it

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
so it's really not going to weigh it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.650 
so it's really not going to weigh it
down<00:03:46.230> or<00:03:46.500> anything<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:48.450> good<00:03:48.630> for

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
down or anything like that it's good for

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.530 
down or anything like that it's good for
five<00:03:49.170> hours<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.680> talktime<00:03:49.950> or<00:03:50.549> seven<00:03:51.329> days

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.279 
fashion so you can have it actively
connected<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.180> two<00:04:15.359> phones<00:04:15.660> at<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> same<00:04:16.079> time

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
connected to two phones at the same time

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.449 
connected to two phones at the same time
so<00:04:16.560> really<00:04:17.310> overall<00:04:17.789> quite<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> nice<00:04:18.450> package

so really overall quite a nice package

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.500 
so really overall quite a nice package
one<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.609> things<00:04:20.820> you're<00:04:20.970> really<00:04:21.329> going<00:04:21.450> to

find to be interesting though is what

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.010 
find to be interesting though is what
they<00:04:23.130> call<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.550> environmental<00:04:24.270> mode<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.780> you
