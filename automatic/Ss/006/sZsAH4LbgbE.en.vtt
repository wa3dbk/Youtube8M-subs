 so unloading was behind me like me 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.450

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.159

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.929
 achieved 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.160
 day that chains would come off again 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.930

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.430
 to hit just one more about the item here 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.990

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.330
 eight minutes left 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.030
