00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.379
 it's gone after a very long season 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.499
 hard in the beginning has ended a 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.730
 unbeatable way winning the cup 

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:11.440
 english of the champions league 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.410
 coming to the selection you can not 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.270
 ask for a better good ending that's good 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.189
 I believe that today came selection 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.340
 it is very complicated every day more and that 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.279
 there are 19 players that repeat wants 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.250
 say it's a block made a block 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.630
 compact where there is no fissure where we 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.849
 we know the equipment works there is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.309
 change few things and the comrades that 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.809
 they are incorporated because they do not give us 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.910
 things that maybe the group did not have like this 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.000
 which I think are a very complete group and 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 that is very very well armed good 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.469
 maybe it's said that young teams 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.000
 they are for the future no but this 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.489
 selection has shown that it has 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.050
 present is the good thing and has the future 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.210
 in many young players who 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.770
 incorporate in the selection of the first 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.809
 day they play as if they had been living all their lives 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.700
 with us and that's good I think it's 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.820
 the incorporation 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.590
 of these players gives us to think that 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.120
 in the future this selection may continue 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.060
 competing and if we look at the guys that 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.440
 have come from the sub-21 people like 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.420
 it was olympic selection the best is the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.310
 impressive universe and that in Spain 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.600
 you can be calm because the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 generations that come stomping 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.909
 really 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 man is for me to have marked only the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 It is clear that it is a very 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
 important as you say in the end those 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 moments that are remembered and proud and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.359
 I have been lucky to be the one who marks 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.530
 the goal because I've been in a great 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.780
 generation of players that we have 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.429
 given the opportunity to play the final and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.579
 I think the Euro Cup for all those who 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.130
 we were there is a turning point 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.659
 total being able to win for the first time 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.350
 that barrier of rooms also against 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.729
 italy I think that they started to build what 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.310
 that today is the champion selection 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.009
 of the world 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.439
 and of course there is a bit of record left 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.729
 get for this selection and few 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.320
 numbers not individually and 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.780
 collectively that is one of them is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.960
 something that nobody has ever done in the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.729
 football then you have to understand the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.590
 importance of the difficulty that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.270
 have so hopefully we can be the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.630
 early why we are here we will 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.630
 give everything
