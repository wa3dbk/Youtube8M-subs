 orzinuovi 93 the new center 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.639
 multi-functional blue tooth not simple 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.130
 dental office as they explained 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 the doctors pietro co and gianantonio micali

 holders of the new structure 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 a real center with a whole 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.770
 medical team dedicated to care 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.539
 of the person 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 let's try decided to do a center 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.160
 multi-purpose where there is presence 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.199
 as well as to dentists also from 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 presence of general practitioners 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.660
 so we have a specialist in 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.480
 internal medicine 1 in turin swallows between 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 a plastic surgeon a nutritionist 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.790
 an osteopath is a doctor who takes care of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.440
 of anesthesia and pain therapy 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.610
 the goal of our center and then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 the note to give a point of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 referring to the patient and if 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.809
 who must know that this center us 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 we can treat the person 360 degrees 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.059
 ie solve any kind of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.469
 problem 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.329
 a new reality that starts from brescia 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.969
 aiming to create a direct relationship 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.649
 with patients but also with the will 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.670
 to launch a growth project in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.579
 Italy and abroad 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 here in Brescia because first of all 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.260
 brescia as in the rest of Italy comes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.240
 missing on the reality of the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.850
 territory a structure where 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 within the same structure 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:19.080
 more specialized figures come to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.439
 work in a team for which the surgeon 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 plastic the nutritionist osteopath 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.759

 as well as the implant surgeon 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.960
 the dentist they can together 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.280
 issue a correct diagnosis in 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.049
 towards the patient 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 we decided to do this 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.180
 structure that aims to grow 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.700
 so make others in Italy and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.070
 even abroad it can be Germany 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.539
 if not the face besides the five studies 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.520
 dentists also equipment 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.200
 at the forefront of diagnosis and one 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.409
 operating room 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.759
 inside the structure then we are 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.400
 served with technical instruments and 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.890
 mostly 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 latest technology machinery for which 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.800
 we have the bean attack which is one 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.790
 machine that can with very little 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.440
 emission of rays and make a diagnosis 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.390
 three-dimensional in cranial level beyond 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.490
 to this we have the cad cam that another 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.920
 machine that gives the possibility to do 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.840
 immediate therapies for which the patient 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.440
 that applies which must do or a load 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.480
 immediate or replace an old one 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.940
 prosthesis or an old crown comes to him 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.770
 made in the day and beyond this then 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.150
 we also have techniques for example the 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.360
 nitrous oxide for sedation 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.610
 conscious with the anesthesiologist together for 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.550
 which the patient is also evaluated by 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.100
 point of view of symptoms and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.320
 therapies he has in place for which one 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.720
 return of problems during 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.570
 intervention beyond other machinery for 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.690
 example also a machine 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.300
 who gives the possibility of with blood 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.820
 of the patient to be 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.880
 only made the site by a doctor 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.130
 specific to be able to do rejuvenation 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.930
 face or accelerate the time of 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 healing available to patients 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.160
 also a shuttle service to home e 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.209
 a waiting room with ipad internet 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.320
 we tried to give the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.989
 patient something in more files what in 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.760
 most is mainly we have 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.030
 equipped with the structure of a shuttle that is 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.860
 a shuttle bus that will pick up the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.940
 patients directly at home is the only one 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.739
 home company 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.300
 when they are they have the possibilities of 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.220
 drive or why they don't want to 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.050
 maybe move with your own vehicle 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.940
 this is one of the things we aim for 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.670
 a lot because it is really a novelty in 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.019
 this area our our 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.030
 center with two waiting rooms 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.040
 both very elegant a lot 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.260
 comfortable but a mainly also 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
 just the massage chairs will have 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.799
 ipads for browsing 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.500
 internet that we do n't have we have in 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.170
 endowment patients so that even in the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.420
 in the short periods of time in which they must 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.180
 wait let's say our own 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.769
 patient shift can continue his 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.989
 business or work or 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.209
 curiosity without even going for 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.459
 case on the internet to look so for the 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.950
 in short, their curiosity is the ultimate goal 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.959
 offer a service referred to 360 degrees 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.100
 that goes beyond dentistry to 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.100
 pamper patients
