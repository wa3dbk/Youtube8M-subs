00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.510 

my<00:03:46.709> cueball<00:03:47.130> trucking<00:03:47.610> back<00:03:48.110> yeah<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:50.400> know

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
my cueball trucking back yeah you know

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.949 
my cueball trucking back yeah you know
like<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.760> bend<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.970> little<00:03:51.000> further<00:03:51.360> down<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.660> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
like to bend a little further down on it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.590 
like to bend a little further down on it
but<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.140> thinking<00:03:52.650> handle<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.190> shot<00:03:53.459> he<00:03:54.450> has

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
chalk on the on the apron of the table

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.820 
chalk on the on the apron of the table
every<00:04:03.630> time<00:04:03.900> he<00:04:03.989> makes<00:04:04.080> a<00:04:04.260> shot<00:04:04.440> he's<00:04:04.590> vaguely

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
every time he makes a shot he's vaguely

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.550 
every time he makes a shot he's vaguely
happy<00:04:05.310> with<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.810> he'll<00:04:09.989> be<00:04:10.140> pretty<00:04:10.350> happy
