00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.860
 hello everyone with you skipper and in this video 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.800
 you know what it is 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.869
 British Premium Fighter Miles M20 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.060
 after the nazi invasion 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.619
 Holland France and Belgium turned out 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.720
 what German troops can get 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.400
 air superiority due to which 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.470
 the British command was 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.660
 taken the decision to design and 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.940
 soon release single unpretentious 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 in fighter production in addition 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 to the successfully fighting spitfire and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.730
 hurricane am after long trials 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.070
 which were accompanied by permanent 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.949
 seizure related problems 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.550
 armament of the engine and many others all 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.769
 Same 4 modification m 20/4 was ready 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.510
 however by that time the need for 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.399
 these aircraft disappeared due to 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.449
 the advent of a more perfect hawker 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.010
 hurricane in miles m20 game costs 1400 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.350
 gold when compared with others 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 premium fighters on level five then 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.190
 it should be noted that it is presented 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.950
 a strong middle peasant who has already managed 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.650
 Many pilots will like the strength 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.080
 aircraft 210 units it is the same as in 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.360
 langley for all who curtis p-40 m-105 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.490
 Windu this with proper piloting 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.810
 destroy the car with one call not 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.750
 the simplest task 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 with weapons everything is much more interesting 8 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.310
 small-caliber machine guns browning very 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 good from close to possible 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.490
 machine guns are not the highest 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 rate of fire but excellent initial 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.020
 projectile speed and low overheating 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.030
 compensates for this full speed 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.650
 ambiguous indicators on the one hand 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 good optimum height present 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.850
 in size 1100 meters plus the best 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.860
 rate of climb of all new premium 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.450
 airplanes on level five on the other 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.530
 maximum speed on the ground and on 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.600
 altitude depresses 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.390
 here we lose to everyone the same thing 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
 can be said about the speed of a dive 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.900
 rescue miles m20 acceptable 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.110
 300 maneuverability two units 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.030
 average garage time 16.4 in seconds 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.790
 allows you to get involved in dogfight and quite 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.229
 not bad to show yourself there in order to 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.030
 strengthen the characteristics of the combat vehicle 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.160
 modules should be put 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.140
 first improved sight then 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.239
 aero varnish and finally 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.230
 reinforced trim consumables and 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.580
 munitions are 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.500
 it is desirable to take armor-piercing 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.280
 hot ribbon is not cheap but you 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.950
 get a good gain kuru 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 with the chance of burning the opponent necessarily 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 stark then new gasoline and pneumatic 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.819
 engine restart and third choice 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.890
 first aid kit or fire extinguisher pilot skills 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.030
 standard first thing improved 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.200
 review then sniper and motor connoisseur 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.330
 let's consider tactical 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.250
 fighter application first 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.680
 need to know the possibilities of the course 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.480
 weapons since it is small caliber 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.400
 machine gun and, accordingly, range 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.530
 defeat they have very little conclusion 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.510
 obvious frontal attacks practically 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.670
 prohibited and an exception can be considered 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 dive at the enemy from above under the big 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 angle or attempt to eliminate the plane 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.640
 which has little left 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.290
 amount of strength if you meet in 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.930
 enemy frontal attack with a cannon 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.300
 arming a chance to win in a duel 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.250
 almost zero so the first option 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.200
 being at the top of the list try to play from 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.760
 heights of speed will not always be enough 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.860
 but decent altitude and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.230
 duration afterburner partly 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.880
 compensates oddly enough armament 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.890
 though not long-range but thanks 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 the amount and concentration of fire from 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.459
 most rivals are obtained 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.680
 get rid of one or two visits 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.120
 rising to the beginning of the battle for two two with 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.250
 half a kilometer helping 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.989
 eliminate heavy and light tall 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.269
 fighters if they are in the zone 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.459
 reach critical moments 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.049
 take your opponent down to knit with 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.959
 him to fight in more comfortable conditions 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.120
 for yourself the main thing to remember if German 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.560
 machines or for example p-40 tries 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.180
 take you three kilometers away 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.880
 must reject the tempting 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.739
 sentence and come down here with 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.780
 Soviet or Japanese fighters 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.299
 it is possible to play through the vertical and 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
 climb of course classic 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.660
 tactical fighter application 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.030
 can be considered close maneuverable battle 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.100
 average turn time is quite good and 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.810
 timely release flaps can 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.760
 will dovernut for many enemies 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.040
 this way you will constantly 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.220
 be in the middle of the action handing out and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.500
 taking damage surely follows 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.329
 mention the earnings of a combat vehicle with 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.220
 premium account average per battle 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.910
 thanks to stable weapons 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.840
 get 45-60 thousand silver from good 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.030
 fights over 80 thousand silver in total 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.220
 miles m20 is currently 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.230
 stable and 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.670
 Versailles us by plane on the fifth level 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.960
 among premium technology 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.910
 who are equally successful 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.890
 confronts both high-altitude and 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.160
 maneuverable machines but in solitary 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.800
 duels loses and on this perhaps all 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.140
 with you was a skipper specifically for combat 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.140
 fraternity all good luck all bye
