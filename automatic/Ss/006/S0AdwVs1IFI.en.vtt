00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.210
 you see we go on with our pack 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.370
 inger test of the macbook 12 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 this is the original transformer e 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.449
 this sold apart from the most important 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 essential accessory I dare say 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.130
 to be able to have usb compatibility 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.670
 cia the traditional usb 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.410
 if you wish you can also connect to the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.560
 charger and in this case if you are 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.590
 go for a ride with an iphone or a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.350
 ipad you can connect and use a single one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 transformer the travel case 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 super lightweight for your iphone too 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 as well as for ipad as well as for the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 your computer 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 but we quickly see a thing of the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.800
 computer is the size first 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 chargers, and this one in 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 my right hand and a charger of 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.050
 a macbook air is a generation 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.340
 old of 2011 still with the plug ad 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.619
 right angle not with the plug 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.439
 horizontal this is the current one 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.869
 12 inch netbook battery charger 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.869
 as you can see more power than 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.110
 charge speed in just three hours on 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.659
 macbook 12 is fully recharged 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 compared to almost 5 in the air but 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.640
 smaller size and let's get one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.720
 comparison of remains of our new 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 macbook 12 with an old macbook air 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 if we try to overlap the two 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.509
 machines appears immediately evident 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.270
 that these are two computers that have 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 of substantially different measures 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 even if they play in the same category 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.899
 of the ultra - thin the passage of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.320
 dimension between the old and the new 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.720
 more than a finger by drawing the distance 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 between the two computers more than a finger of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.079
 long distance as far as 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.630
 concerns the traditional macbook air 11 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.710
 which is in the lightest metallic color 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.060
 while in the aluminum color 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 classic silver on the other hand 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 the coloring of the spacegrey model does 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.750
 see clearly that not only is it 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.599
 noticeably thinner appreciably 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.380
 lighter but also significantly more 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.270
 short 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.790
 the two keyboards next to each other 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.980
 let's see them very quickly with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.690
 lighting the new lighting a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 led of each of the new rates 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 computer instead of using a single one 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.560
 filament that travels through all the others 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.780
 we also activate the lighting of the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.850
 traditional netbook that a keyboard 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.160
 very macbook air than a keyboard 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.290
 fought since 2011 with some 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.810
 keys slightly worn however one 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.290
 less strong and above all lighting 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.180
 less stable we will also see later in the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.010
 details during the other recession 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.140
 aspects, however, it is worth noting 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.170
 immediately three small things of the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.910
 keyboard to the first is that the the keys with 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.410
 the arrows the two right and left keys 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.200
 for the arrow they have become whole 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.360
 height no more than half-height there is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.280
 written entirely on the keyboard 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.859
 what the single key corresponds to 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.670
 instead of being synthesized and then this 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:13.180
 gigantic dimension of the east key which 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.660
 has become much larger than the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.220
 previous model we can also 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.900
 check with the old macbook air a 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.700
 11 inches the keyboard is never 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.220
 the generation generation changed 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.959
 re-entry is greater than the arrow keys 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.150
 right left are lower le 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.760
 writings are only hinted at and the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.769
 bait button with smaller dimensions e 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.230
 this was to give an overview 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.680
 you can also see the rendering of the screen 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.100
 retina in we will see better picture of the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.060
 new macbook 12 in trial for 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.060
