00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 I'll never be more secretive. 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.449
 eight analysts 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.359
 necklace 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.710
 john person weapon 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.910
 What's written on your show? 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.580
 is that today I was going to talk about the interpretation of children's ideas 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.150
 wild 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.370
 and what tomorrow 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.300
 I would say that for theory of knowledge and school learning 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
 in practice 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.180
 according to the lecture 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.230
 it was made clear 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 that I had to do otherwise 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 begin 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.239
 lectures on interpretation 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.090
 each industrial district 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.640
 and he happened 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.759
 little apple on the street 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.619
 so I decided 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.790
 Sorry for the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.870
 The thump is coming 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.420
 more than seven series 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.590
 we need them 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 the shows you will not do differently 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.830
 does anyone know any 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.130
 in three years we know the note that the dollar will stay stuck with lack 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.290
 I think he was very unhappy. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 at this time 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.719
 in a way, that's assuming that what I'm going to say 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.730
 I've never done a speech that the session is on this topic 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.510
 last Friday 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.300
 a little weird 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.800
 the mashable site 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.580
 mary jane lubchenco 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 theories of knowledge 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.710
 it's to be true 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.200
 I also think 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.909
 he would never think of making a word about it 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:13.469
 It turns out that the supervisory work of the team of policy makers 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.489
 Chinese and Indian 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.829
 all our supervisory meetings until the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.479
 learning grants 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.639
 one of them was late 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.739
 more or less established but it seems that 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.759
 in another speech that practice has a huge hole in the survey 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.889
 so I'm going to retire 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.139
 this time 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.479
 when we analyzed a lack of information 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:49.039
 or when we will need to be done 10h36 that you 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.649
 all our meals 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:54.999
 this fast 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.659
 Good of what you imagine 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.679
 kuki learning grant 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.679
 students or recent graduates 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.199
 because of this the team 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.559
 he does not have that fame 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.559
 and I preferred to give possibilities 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.849
 I just arrived 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.449
 unrelated 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.339
 this theme forced me to go back 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.019
 theories of knowledge 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.289
 that as Paulo Freire taught us 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.289
 she addressed all issues of education 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.920
 is the learning grant letter 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.379
 and of teaching models 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.399
 still in the session of the day and pedagogy 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.199
 we must go back 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.300
 back 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.619
 like this 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.549
 where philologies are the knowledge to establish 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.849
 I do not have position 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.409
 a theory of knowledge may be justified in antiquity 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.159
 as a branch of philosophy 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.529
 the questions 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.689
 and pedagogy did not exist in s 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:01.559
 it's for 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.839
 the manager 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:08.079
 was a branch of philosophy that deals with the origin and nature in 2010 of 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.099
 knowledge 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.839
 the sales of trucks originated with a double as 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.189
 in another friendly 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.239
 although both had been distinguished from the facts 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.939
 he never understood about it 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:24.410
 romario 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.599
 two currents of thought to leave more able to even communicate 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.080
 the question 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.539
 was known 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.710
 if people are already born 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.240
 with potentialities 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.770
 eleven skills that will be developed 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.639
 according 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.599
 with biological maturation 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.419
 that is all that was learned 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.740
 it is through experience 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.870
 the listener 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.590
 I defended the first idea 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.270
 people are already born with good potential that hit the country 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.110
 which will be developed according to the brand biological knowledge while 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.110
 in shoppings nailed 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.259
 all around the world 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.469
 to arrive 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.389
 to know the transvestite hand 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.240
 experience and dem 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.490
 where the contact with the external world 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.069
 it's the only way 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.039
 to gain knowledge 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.419
 the Platonic position has been called rationalism 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.120
 and natixis 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.419
 also provides for 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.150
 in a superficial way we can say that in this position 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 the source of all knowledge and reason 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.610
 according to Plato we were born pre-formed in our potentialities and aptitudes 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.659
 and what we call development 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.759
 is only an update of these potentialities 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.499
 through maturation of classes 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.829
 the Aristotelian position says that everything is developed through experience 

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:56.659
 and that contact with 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.719
 the external world 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.669
 the only possible access to knowledge 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.360
 for this position 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.120
 in his radical form the man with the owner selma tabula rasa the tv gazeta expression 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.080
 But what can I say, he said? 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.759
 it's a thing in braga 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.319
 the only source all human knowledge 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.210
 would be the experience 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.530
 hence the name 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.409
 intelligent 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.409
 these differentials be sent by scientists 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.949
 the theme you move specific of psychology and not of philosophy 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.340
 lorena sp 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.099
 of the conception that despite being 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.499
 the whole process of association of ideas 

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:47.809
 today the citizen 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:50.159
 the name of my house 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.259
 as a kind of indication 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.149
 the power in environment environments 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.409
 the strong impact knowledge 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.409
 addressing to observe that to be triggered 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:02.930
 the Paraguayan 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.669
 taking knowledge and the level 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.360
 and students 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.620
 where access to knowledge is by rational inference of the subject 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.509
 and for the participants the paradigm 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.569
 it's natural science 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.369
 with their observations and experiments 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.949
 This is the focus on his name. 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:25.169
 I'm not going 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.180
 put in human sciences here because there the chaos settles 

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:34.610
 in these two three strands 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.479
 you have 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.309
 but the novelty to think 

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:41.349
 to try to compensate 

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:42.520
 a lot more 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.479
 as a nationalist 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:45.060
 than
