00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
can do it online a lot easier it's the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.139 
can do it online a lot easier it's the
same<00:01:36.740> way<00:01:36.950> but<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.610> should<00:01:37.640> gotta<00:01:37.940> do<00:01:38.119> a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
same way but you should gotta do a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.270 
same way but you should gotta do a
different<00:01:38.660> technique<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.710> throw<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.130> care

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
different technique you throw the care

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.340 
different technique you throw the care
package<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.060> same<00:01:41.300> exact<00:01:41.660> place<00:01:41.840> you

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
package in the same exact place you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.300 
package in the same exact place you
would<00:01:42.500> for<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.190> original<00:01:45.039> after<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.130> care

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
would for the original after the care

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.310 
would for the original after the care
package<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:46.640> like<00:01:46.789> throw<00:01:47.149> away<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.810> second<00:01:48.229> is

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
package is like throw away the second is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.310 
package is like throw away the second is
thrown<00:01:48.649> that's<00:01:49.399> when<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.869> start<00:01:50.869> waiting<00:01:51.170> you

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320

gotta<00:01:51.470> wait<00:01:51.619> a<00:01:51.649> minute<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.100> 3<00:01:52.280> seconds<00:01:52.670> I<00:01:52.910> sped

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
gotta wait a minute in 3 seconds I sped

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.150 
gotta wait a minute in 3 seconds I sped
it<00:01:53.720> up<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.080> here<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:54.590> when<00:01:54.740> you're<00:01:54.830> doing<00:01:55.039> the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.389 

once<00:02:09.170> you're<00:02:09.319> in<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.470> lift<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.860> you're

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
once you're in the lift and you're

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.520 
once you're in the lift and you're
moving<00:02:11.060> across<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.390> map<00:02:11.630> with<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.319> care

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
moving across the map with the care

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
moving across the map with the care
package<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> roof<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.730> gotta<00:02:13.940> wait<00:02:14.360> till

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
package on the roof you gotta wait till

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.150 
package on the roof you gotta wait till
you<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:14.810> over<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.140> excavator<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.980> once

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you get over the excavator and once

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.870 
you get over the excavator and once
you're<00:02:16.310> over<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.550> excavator<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.209> hold<00:02:17.540> X<00:02:17.810> and

you're over the excavator you hold X and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.550 
you're over the excavator you hold X and
hope<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.510> care<00:02:20.720> package<00:02:20.989> disappears

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
hope that the care package disappears

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.500 
hope that the care package disappears
