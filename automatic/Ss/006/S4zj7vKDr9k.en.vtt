00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.520 

most<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.820> my<00:05:10.850> background<00:05:11.480> my<00:05:11.990> working

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
most of my background my working

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.740 
most of my background my working
background<00:05:12.920> at<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.130> moment<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.700> teaching

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
background at the moment is teaching

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.040 
background at the moment is teaching
I<00:05:15.310> don't<00:05:16.310> specialize<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.270> only<00:05:17.570> one

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
I don't specialize in only one

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.980 
I don't specialize in only one
discipline<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:19.520> we<00:05:19.730> are<00:05:19.850> trying<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.390> get<00:05:20.570> lots

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
discipline so we are trying to get lots

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.050 
discipline so we are trying to get lots
of<00:05:21.260> information<00:05:21.590> in<00:05:22.130> certainly<00:05:22.850> with<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
of information in certainly with the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.020 
of information in certainly with the
beginners<00:05:23.540> where<00:05:23.810> where<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:25.310> know<00:05:25.490> most<00:05:25.730> of

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
beginners where where you know most of

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.110 
beginners where where you know most of
my<00:05:26.150> time<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.690> effort<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.140> its<00:05:27.740> base<00:05:27.950> its<00:05:28.760> tool

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
my time and effort is its base its tool

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.150 
my time and effort is its base its tool
technique<00:05:29.510> so<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.680> suppose<00:05:30.890> you<00:05:30.980> could<00:05:31.130> say

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
technique so I suppose you could say

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.940 
technique so I suppose you could say
tool<00:05:31.610> technique<00:05:32.000> is<00:05:32.180> my<00:05:32.450> is<00:05:33.110> my<00:05:33.170> thing<00:05:33.680> really

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
tool technique is my is my thing really

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.150 
tool technique is my is my thing really
and<00:05:34.640> I<00:05:34.880> enjoy<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.230> fun<00:05:36.500> things<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.980> like

the<00:05:37.190> Christmas<00:05:37.520> tree<00:05:37.850> decorations<00:05:38.510> I've<00:05:38.720> just

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
the Christmas tree decorations I've just

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.430 
the Christmas tree decorations I've just
demoed<00:05:40.300> one-off<00:05:41.300> bowls<00:05:41.690> naturally<00:05:42.350> those

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
demoed one-off bowls naturally those

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.440 
demoed one-off bowls naturally those
bowls<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:43.100> sort<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.430> thing<00:05:43.640> I<00:05:43.820> also<00:05:44.000> enjoy

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
bowls that sort of thing I also enjoy

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.050 
bowls that sort of thing I also enjoy
the<00:05:44.480> discipline<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.520> production<00:05:46.520> work<00:05:46.700> so

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
the discipline of production work so

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.050 
the discipline of production work so
staircase<00:05:47.510> spindles<00:05:48.020> in<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.410> strange<00:05:48.740> way<00:05:48.980> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
staircase spindles in a strange way I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.760 
staircase spindles in a strange way I
really<00:05:50.060> enjoy<00:05:50.420> that<00:05:50.450> it's<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.470> have<00:05:51.650> to

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
really enjoy that it's that you have to

00:05:51.770 --> 00:06:19.159 
really enjoy that it's that you have to
discipline<00:05:52.160> yourself

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.510 

I've<00:06:20.169> done<00:06:20.350> three<00:06:20.470> demonstrations<00:06:21.130> today<00:06:21.370> the

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
I've done three demonstrations today the

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.689 
I've done three demonstrations today the
first<00:06:21.760> one<00:06:21.880> was<00:06:22.150> bowls<00:06:22.410> clatters<00:06:23.520> and<00:06:24.520> that

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
first one was bowls clatters and that

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.700 
first one was bowls clatters and that
was<00:06:24.850> taking<00:06:25.300> rough<00:06:25.690> during<00:06:25.930> bowls

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
was taking rough during bowls

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.120 
was taking rough during bowls
once<00:06:27.340> they've<00:06:27.639> moved<00:06:28.180> Android<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:29.770> finish

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
once they've moved Android to finish

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.189 
once they've moved Android to finish
product<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:30.760> then<00:06:31.419> we<00:06:31.570> looked<00:06:31.810> holding

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
product and then we looked holding

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.710 
product and then we looked holding
techniques<00:06:32.800> of<00:06:32.919> platters<00:06:33.370> so<00:06:33.970> how<00:06:34.270> we<00:06:34.330> use<00:06:34.540> the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
techniques of platters so how we use the

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.570 
techniques of platters so how we use the
chalk<00:06:34.990> in<00:06:35.169> conjunction<00:06:35.500> with<00:06:35.710> recesses<00:06:36.250> and

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
chalk in conjunction with recesses and

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.190 
chalk in conjunction with recesses and
spindles

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
spindles

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.900 
spindles
the<00:06:38.410> second<00:06:38.860> demonstration<00:06:39.040> was<00:06:39.580> friction

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
the second demonstration was friction

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.060 
the second demonstration was friction
chucking<00:06:40.419> so<00:06:40.570> fairly<00:06:40.840> old<00:06:41.080> technique<00:06:41.620> inhaled

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
chucking so fairly old technique inhaled

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.580 
chucking so fairly old technique inhaled
of<00:06:42.280> old<00:06:42.760> things<00:06:43.120> like<00:06:43.300> the<00:06:43.479> VARs<00:06:43.720> or<00:06:44.020> pieces<00:06:44.410> of

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
of old things like the VARs or pieces of

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.310 
of old things like the VARs or pieces of
fruit<00:06:44.830> in<00:06:45.040> a<00:06:45.160> friction<00:06:45.580> jerk<00:06:45.960> top<00:06:46.960> and<00:06:47.139> tell

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
fruit in a friction jerk top and tell

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.790 
fruit in a friction jerk top and tell
them<00:06:47.560> with<00:06:48.400> no<00:06:48.639> forms<00:06:49.120> or<00:06:49.450> no<00:06:49.720> visible<00:06:50.020> signs

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
them with no forms or no visible signs

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.010 
them with no forms or no visible signs
of<00:06:50.979> holding<00:06:51.430> and<00:06:51.700> then<00:06:52.270> the<00:06:52.419> third<00:06:52.660> one<00:06:52.840> today

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
of holding and then the third one today

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.790 
of holding and then the third one today
was<00:06:53.970> again<00:06:54.970> a<00:06:55.000> bit<00:06:55.210> of<00:06:55.300> fun<00:06:55.930> inspired<00:06:56.410> by<00:06:56.620> my

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
was again a bit of fun inspired by my

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.939 
was again a bit of fun inspired by my
children<00:06:58.050> making<00:06:59.050> Christmas<00:06:59.740> tree

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
children making Christmas tree

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.790 
children making Christmas tree
decorations<00:07:00.610> like<00:07:00.760> snowmen<00:07:01.590> Christmas<00:07:02.590> trees

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
themselves that sort of thing opposite

themselves that sort of thing opposite
the<00:07:09.880> first<00:07:10.150> mark<00:07:10.539> rather<00:07:10.960> than<00:07:11.260> next<00:07:11.770> to<00:07:11.979> the

the first mark rather than next to the

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.159 
the first mark rather than next to the
opposite<00:07:12.789> because<00:07:13.300> I<00:07:13.479> don't<00:07:13.750> want<00:07:14.020> these

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169 
opposite because I don't want these

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:16.230 
opposite because I don't want these
goings<00:07:14.650> too<00:07:14.950> close<00:07:15.190> to<00:07:15.370> each<00:07:15.490> other<00:07:15.669> because

goings too close to each other because
what<00:07:16.570> happens<00:07:16.960> this<00:07:17.139> timber<00:07:17.410> being<00:07:17.620> so<00:07:17.770> soft

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
what happens this timber being so soft

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:31.020 
what happens this timber being so soft
it's<00:07:18.280> hair<00:07:18.460> around<00:07:28.080> opposite<00:07:29.080> pole<00:07:29.320> and<00:07:30.030> our

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
it's hair around opposite pole and our

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.450 
it's hair around opposite pole and our
next<00:07:31.479> cut<00:07:31.840> is<00:07:32.050> going<00:07:32.200> to<00:07:32.260> be<00:07:32.410> the<00:07:32.560> next<00:07:32.889> one<00:07:33.099> on

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
next cut is going to be the next one on

next cut is going to be the next one on
from<00:07:34.330> this<00:07:34.479> point<00:07:34.780> so<00:07:34.930> I<00:07:35.020> cut<00:07:35.229> next<00:07:35.590> to<00:07:35.650> that

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 
from this point so I cut next to that

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.589 
from this point so I cut next to that
line<00:07:36.090> okay<00:07:37.090> if<00:07:37.510> I<00:07:37.780> can't<00:07:38.139> if<00:07:38.410> I<00:07:38.560> go<00:07:38.970> beside<00:07:39.970> this

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
line okay if I can't if I go beside this

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.839 
line okay if I can't if I go beside this
first<00:07:40.990> mark<00:07:41.320> that<00:07:41.500> I<00:07:41.530> made<00:07:41.620> and<00:07:42.310> take<00:07:42.520> a<00:07:42.550> cut
