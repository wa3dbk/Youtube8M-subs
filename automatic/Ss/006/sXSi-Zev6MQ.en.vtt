00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.240
 Four long years was often more lanes 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.460
 be submerged in the world now is 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.380
 finally back as a remake in easy 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.330
 Tomb Raider called new game 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 and yes we both play viktor and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.830
 you have to see how jupiter window 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.250
 really get along with playing because 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.200
 that's a special thing 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.050
 that he is of course always special 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.370
 such a reboot a question the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.990
 Developers are thinking about how 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.020
 I can get new players 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.430
 or too strong for my target audience 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.430
 Of course it can happen 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.890
 that maybe a bit over 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.320
 the plans go out I say 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.510
 It's not a bad game 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.820
 no case is just a big one 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:06.259
 great model namely uncharted everything 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 staging two they however 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.490
 at least what the story presentation and 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.780
 their dialogues are even more important 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.249
 can offer straight in the German 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.829
 I was not so happy 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.929
 I have to say yes, I also found in 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.549
 the story lasts a long time until you get there 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.409
 really comes and only later 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.240
 if he has these mystical elements then 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.859
 comes in then makes it this way slowly 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.509
 a little bit fun to follow 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.509
 a lot of police wasted 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.050
 you can see it is as said very much 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.190
 The whole thing is reminiscent of uncharted 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.860
 This vision action is enough 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.680
 staging with any one 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 camera rides the music is great sound 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.600
 effects very well but as I said 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.420
 you can stand in front of the old gates 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.970
 later it is of course very 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 getting used to it's just too close 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.930
 I want to modernize to a certain degree 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.760
 times now so clearly say there is not a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 uncharted clown you can not do that 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.240
 claim claim especially since one harms 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 actually from tomb raider at the very 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.540
 has looked at the beginning has that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.060
 now a little bit in a circle 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.979
 developed so to speak that reminds already 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.459
 with his chinese stagings 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.550
 his intense presentation at first 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.950
 expects yes and also with the fight focus 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.300
 There are a lot of fights in the game and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.830
 You have to say that is not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.320
 necessarily the strength of the tomb raider 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.790
 because you are actually fighting very high 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.459
 lie the same human opponents 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.600
 and never really has these as in 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.120
 it has been against previous games 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.590
 animals or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 fighting mythical creatures and so on 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.940
 it was much too rarely was can from now 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.830
 and once against wolves for example but 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.940
 the problem is not necessarily that you 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.140
 but fighting against humans 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.250
 that's always the same standard 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.450
 opponents are you have a stop 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.490
 little more armor or gallery 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.960
 weapons but that 's it they behave 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.780
 just the same and the dull one 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.010
 little bit of who water quite good you 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.300
 do you get through the fighting experience 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.460
 and also by exploring the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 game world and there they actually have 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.810
 quite motivating system created 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 by learning your new skills or 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 even your weapons upgrade is and that 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 I talked quite well because 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.750
 you're always looking for that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.250
 next and next upgrade at 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.170
 I am also very much in favor of the weapons 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.560
 because they have it 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.060
 made 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.350
 on the one hand, very few different ones 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.030
 to give arms here that you do not 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.560
 overwhelmed to on the other hand by the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.510
 alley from now on but they play 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.220
 very different with time 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.840
 for example grenade launcher for the mg 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.840
 wrong old or the bow is many 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.060
 additional features get or arrows so 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.200
 Ammunition types to get that has a lot 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.209
 I got a lot of dynamism very well 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.250
 fallen big in the apron was 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.840
 yes this open game world more or 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.910
 less there is nothing to say one 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.190
 open game world does not really have 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.040
 the game but it has just this more 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.440
 branching you have collected many 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.910
 Secrets and you can stop yourself like that 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.709
 little bit around them just new tools 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.790
 Unlock by duh new ways 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.940
 and then you have a bit too 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.489
 backtracking but in comparison to 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.780
 example is a batman arkham city 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.450
 then not quite so generous 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.030
 it's just an up system in 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.500
 the three four big hub I'll say that 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.030
 you can play very far during the game 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.620
 look around and you can find her good 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.450
 but of course you also have ruler 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.220
 Passagen yes it has me on everyone 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.110
 fall better than uncharted must 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.590
 he really only really one 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.340
 gives away 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.049
 Although this makes it much better 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.419
 but I was disappointed by the seven 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.710
 riddles tombs they should actually 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.180
 this mystery focus even more 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.340
 bring out if you are a bit like that 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.590
 have to ponder 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.870
 I found that were devised as cool 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.720
 There was an element in the person from the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.390
 Physics So distribute wind or weight 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.080
 and so on but the things were just 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.039
 super fast over 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.319
 I always agree with you in this 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.749
 of course completely optional the graves 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.759
 but it could have been more 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.319
 just the very first two or three 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.840
 you can do something in five minutes 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:54.229
 maximum enforced and that's all 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.909
 always a single room a little yes 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.259
 So that's what really got me 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:06.860
 a bit disappointed and I hold it there 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:08.439
 how the good woman croft fits naturally 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.310
 to one as a lie 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.509
 maybe it's a bit 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.219
 the German language edition that the 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.169
 just a little weird sounded like 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.860
 already mentioned that you did not have me like that 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.960
 liked 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.479
 So you have nora tschirner here 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.370
 hopes the power also a very hard 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.560
 jobware is struggling to work the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.360
 Nebencharaktere so the court 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.830
 if the setting could take place 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.990
 Not the only problem I found 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.729
 she is also relatively pale and insignificant 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.469
 I have no motivation 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.779
 had to see what actually 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.699
 happens with this group so ne of 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:40.699
 drake or chloe o'brian are here 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.550
 clearly cooler peaceful but general 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.050
 play quite easy on medium so 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.419
 should want to challenge 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.009
 I find it hard to start any case 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.449
 there make the few posts for 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.580
 this game gives more fun if you 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.930
 I was just playing on them 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.849
 also a bit disappointed by 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.229
 the crowd especially the game is very 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.389
 much time are you anyway to properly 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.589
 But you have a thrilling big fight 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.159
 Of course, not everything is negative 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.050
 tomb Raider 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.449
 which has me especially packed next to the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.659
 staging artwork as the technique 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.849
 yourself 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.229
 you have almost no charging times are 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.479
 all very well hidden in the 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.639
 between sequences and the game sees 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.159
 fantastic 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.580
 so it does not have to be uncharted before 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.580
 3 perfect
