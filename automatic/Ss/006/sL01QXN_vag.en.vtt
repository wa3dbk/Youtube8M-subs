00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.420
 hello everyone welcome to another case more 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.849
 of all the music point we have already 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.849
 I've seen a lot of theory stuff with which 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will all go well we were 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.949
 playing a few hours on the piano and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.109
 so today we will see a little small 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 tricks to read sheet music 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.770
 quick on when we jump to the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.540
 piano 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.580
 first of all what are we not going to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.900
 need to know is going to be the name of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.890
 each and every one of the notes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.890
 we place for example here 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.840
 the right hand 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.560
 we have any score in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.350
 a finger for example 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.670
 all right 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.670
 we have this 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.100
 for example 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.159
 and we finish 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.189
 with a double imagine that we 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.450
 we do this on the piano I have the 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.340
 first note that I do have to know 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.530
 what is it worth to know where I am going to 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.140
 place and with a tender for example 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 the 1 is worth with the big toe we're going to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 go to 2 central vale 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.039
 I do this, it's not going to be necessary anymore 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.420
 Knowing what note is in this case is easy 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.789
 of reading is worth it because they are the first 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.729
 notes that we learned you then 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.560
 starting after I play the note of 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.630
 side because we are in a space 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.689
 the side note we are on the line the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.390
 next note the next note and the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.000
 look I'm here in a line and I'm going 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.159
 to jump to another line with which of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 here here with me would mean the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's worth seeing it is in space 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.700
 Well, here I'm just jumping 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.170
 a note on the keyboard we are talking 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.599
 of the moment of the white classroom 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.180
 I skip a note from the keyboard 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.549
 which to spend the sun like that visually 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.680
 it's easier for me to interpret and 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.109
 here I will skip a note 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.390
 that these are and this is yes and see it in the 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.609
 keyboard is a question of the yes that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.340
 I under a note that because I'm 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.409
 of the line to space is worth now I'm 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 in a space that I do the following note 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.310
 I'm going to the next space, not because 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.560
 which I jump one to move from here 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.989
 here I jump one will move from here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.209
 here he simply had a note 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.639
 then to move on from here he 's in the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.950
 line we pass to 2 that is on the line 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:50.590
 whereupon I jump back one with 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.590
 what this is like on the piano 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.189
 Y 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.330
 the times and then 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.890
 then once we have seen this 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.290
 we use that to read notes of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.850
 easy way and above all this what 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.360
 we will apply a lot when reading 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.670
 chords 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.970
 let's see for example examples of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 chords 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.810
 first of all so we put on 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.810
 a note 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.150
 and another note we do not have that now 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.069
 we get off the beat and more simply 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.020
 so you can see the chord with which 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.360
 we have the first note that he is a fan 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.550
 for example and the next that security 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.900
 in this case we see that drawing 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.760
 of chord that is the two notes that 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.860
 they are playing with what I am going to play 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.739
 one note and I jump from another 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.489
 let's see me jump out of one and touch if 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.870
 we complete this with this I will play 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.300
 based solely on the first or 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.269
 in this case I'm going to pass the one below 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.190
 you are a fa not so the rest 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.190
 these two I simply put my fingers 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.709
 so it's easier to read then I read 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.370
 the first and the rest placed the hand of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.640
 next to 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.640
 for example 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.070
 now I have a drawing that is a 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.930
 little bit different from this one that is two 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.020
 notes together and another one that is pretty 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.190
 separated then how can I place myself 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.080
 this 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.730
 in this case we to read them in the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.650
 right hand okay now we are talking 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.210
 on the right hand the best building 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.210
 to do this I agreed it would be this 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.380
 one for king two for the fa and five 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.940
 for the yes with which it is in agreement 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.940
 if I put that hand position 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.870
 I would have the lamb soon 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:10.020
 to add this hand position 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.930
 Well, in case I had to go through 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.879
 to this chord we look at the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.729
 we had before and these two are like 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:20.190
 the two went up, so I do not read 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.599
 be chord and then this I read this and 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.370
 then the progression of these two of 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.370
 down that come up with what this would be 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.949
 for 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.330
 then this would be the best fingering 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.080
 to do this the best food 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.550
 to do this would be like this 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.200
 not always it is in a director nothing 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.750
 with this rating but normally 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.090
 yes what appears above all I want 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.150
 that you stay is with what you see 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.280
 a drawing agreed and put in this case 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.960
 a hand position you see another drawing 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.590
 agree to know another position of 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.970
 hand 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.270
 You see, it's the three of us together 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.170
 before hand policemen if you come by 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.170
 example this one 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:12.300
 the hand position would be 53 15 and 3 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.350
 they would be together and in 1 here 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.350
 in this case 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.520
 it's about all that I want that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.170
 begin to read let's say chords without 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.280
 need to see each and every one of the 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.190
 notes 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.569
 simply progressions in this case 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.210
 it stays the same 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.129
 this low with what will happen from this 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.219
 according to this is simply the position 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:38.289
 that I had then now soul of this 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:40.689
 just this just like this one I have 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.959
 a position I upload these two here 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:49.310
 down this duck calce and is and this one what 

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:51.820
 I would change this 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.820
 this 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.319
 agree then come this moment what 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:59.629
 we leave with the chords that we have 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.490
 I learned a little bit with this in my hand 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.889
 right next day I tell you 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.169
 fingerings for the left hand is worth 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.149
 it's very similar but above all that 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.550
 you are watching the record drawing 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:13.219
 of vale you have a concrete drawing and 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.259
 hanging a hand position is worth it 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.490
 it will always be very simple 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:18.220
 read scores when you do 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.720
 everything at first sight 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.830
 read it with the corresponding agreement 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.910
 Well, see you in the next class 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.910
 see you later to all friends
