what's<00:00:11.100> so<00:00:11.640> special<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.450> CCD<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.470> a

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
what's so special about the CCD it is a

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.870 
what's so special about the CCD it is a
complete<00:00:14.460> new<00:00:14.880> technology<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.510> new<00:00:15.660> super<00:00:16.049> CCD

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
complete new technology a new super CCD

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.540 
complete new technology a new super CCD
40<00:00:17.880> films<00:00:18.030> very<00:00:18.240> famous<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.290> his<00:00:19.410> super<00:00:19.980> CCD

40 films very famous for his super CCD
generations<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.290> with<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.920> super

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
generations now we have with the super

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.690 
generations now we have with the super
CCD<00:00:23.580> XR<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.630> ninth<00:00:24.840> generation<00:00:25.290> and<00:00:26.240> XR<00:00:27.680> that

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
CCD XR the ninth generation and XR that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.080 
CCD XR the ninth generation and XR that
the<00:00:29.700> name<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.270> for<00:00:30.690> extreme<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.190> extremists

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the name is for extreme and extremists

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.869 
the name is for extreme and extremists
the<00:00:33.300> quality<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> new<00:00:34.140> super<00:00:34.800> CCD<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
the quality of the new super CCD with a

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.660 
the quality of the new super CCD with a
high<00:00:36.600> resolution<00:00:36.830> with<00:00:37.830> of<00:00:38.040> iodine<00:00:38.430> amic

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
high resolution with of iodine amic

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.810 
high resolution with of iodine amic
range<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.900> high<00:00:40.140> sensitivity<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> low

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
range with the high sensitivity and low

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.100 
range with the high sensitivity and low
noise<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:44.430> already<00:00:44.610> said<00:00:44.879> low<00:00:45.300> noise<00:00:45.540> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
noise you already said low noise that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.829 
noise you already said low noise that
means<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> goes<00:00:47.089> beyond<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.210> borders<00:00:48.540> we<00:00:48.690> know

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
means it goes beyond the borders we know

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.250 
means it goes beyond the borders we know
now<00:00:49.080> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> ISO<00:00:49.830> range<00:00:50.629> yeah<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.229> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
now in the ISO range yeah we have a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.969 
now in the ISO range yeah we have a
better<00:00:52.860> low<00:00:53.100> noise<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.909> than<00:00:54.330> previous

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
better low noise than than previous

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.770 
better low noise than than previous
super<00:00:55.979> CCD<00:00:56.339> generations<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.739> what's<00:00:59.400> very

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
super CCD generations and what's very

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
super CCD generations and what's very
interesting<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:03.150> the<00:01:04.019> super<00:01:04.620> CCD<00:01:04.979> EXR<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
interesting is that the super CCD EXR is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780 
interesting is that the super CCD EXR is
a<00:01:05.909> flexible<00:01:06.450> sensor<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.620> need<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.190> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a flexible sensor so if you need in a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.180 
a flexible sensor so if you need in a
special<00:01:09.150> situation<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.870> high-resolution<00:01:10.470> okay

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
special situation a high-resolution okay

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.100 
special situation a high-resolution okay
high<00:01:11.610> resolution<00:01:11.820> isn't<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> main<00:01:12.780> topic

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
high resolution isn't the main topic

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
high resolution isn't the main topic
then<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> wide<00:01:14.640> dynamic<00:01:14.820> range

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
then or if you need a wide dynamic range

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.069 
then or if you need a wide dynamic range
then<00:01:15.899> the<00:01:16.259> super<00:01:16.649> CCD<00:01:17.039> XR<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.479> related<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
then the super CCD XR is more related to

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.990 
then the super CCD XR is more related to
to<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.829> widen<00:01:20.130> amock<00:01:20.340> range<00:01:20.579> and<00:01:21.500> low<00:01:22.500> noise

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
to the widen amock range and low noise

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
to the widen amock range and low noise
the<00:01:24.000> same<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.350> based<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> same

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the same it is it based on the same

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
the same it is it based on the same
concept<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.119> normal<00:01:27.450> CCD<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> smaller

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
concept of the normal CCD so a smaller

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.420 
concept of the normal CCD so a smaller
and<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.770> larger<00:01:29.430> pixel<00:01:29.880> perfect<00:01:30.530> location<00:01:31.530> now

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
and a larger pixel perfect location now

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.350 
and a larger pixel perfect location now
we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> complete<00:01:33.149> new<00:01:33.810> pixel<00:01:34.170> array

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.859 

that<00:01:38.360> means<00:01:38.689> that's<00:01:39.200> way<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:40.340> we<00:01:40.460> put<00:01:40.869> the

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
that means that's way that we put the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.760 
that means that's way that we put the
the<00:01:42.039> red<00:01:43.039> hand<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:47.030> blue

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
the red hand and the blue

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.179 
the red hand and the blue
just<00:01:49.460> next<00:01:50.329> two<00:01:50.659> to<00:01:50.899> each<00:01:51.020> other<00:01:51.259> but<00:01:51.500> not<00:01:51.740> only

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
just next two to each other but not only

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.520 
just next two to each other but not only
one<00:01:52.399> it's<00:01:52.850> two<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.420> then<00:01:53.960> we<00:01:54.140> have<00:01:54.320> better

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
one it's two and then we have better

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.800 
one it's two and then we have better
pixel<00:01:54.920> binning<00:01:55.250> maybe<00:01:56.240> it's<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.479> bit<00:01:56.630> very

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
pixel binning maybe it's a bit very

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
pixel binning maybe it's a bit very
happy<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.380> explain<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.340> better<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.759> show

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
happy to explain it's better to show

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.480 
happy to explain it's better to show
maybe<00:01:59.329> now<00:02:00.110> we'll<00:02:00.439> show<00:02:00.469> the<00:02:00.799> image<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.310> the

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
maybe now we'll show the image in the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.940 
maybe now we'll show the image in the
video<00:02:01.610> or<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.240> that's<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.020> good<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.530> say

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
video or so that's that's good and say

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.539 
video or so that's that's good and say
so<00:02:04.789> but<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.539> complete<00:02:05.929> new<00:02:06.380> sensor<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
so but it's a complete new sensor and

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.150 
so but it's a complete new sensor and
complete<00:02:07.969> new<00:02:08.330> pixel<00:02:08.840> array<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.440> that's<00:02:09.920> very

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
complete new pixel array so that's very

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.720 
complete new pixel array so that's very
very<00:02:10.429> very<00:02:10.700> important<00:02:11.239> for<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:12.730> next

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
very very important for that next

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.309 
very very important for that next
question<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:14.239> course<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.629> will<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.140> same

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
question of course is will the same

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.550 
question of course is will the same
sensor<00:02:15.980> be<00:02:16.190> adapted<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.849> new<00:02:17.540> DSLR<00:02:18.019> cameras

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
sensor be adapted in new DSLR cameras

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.059 
sensor be adapted in new DSLR cameras
the<00:02:19.519> first<00:02:19.760> we<00:02:19.940> will<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.569> in<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:21.560> premier

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
the first we will do it in a premier

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.610 
the first we will do it in a premier
compact<00:02:22.549> camera<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.930> beginning<00:02:24.380> of

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
compact camera and this is beginning of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.620 
compact camera and this is beginning of
next<00:02:24.890> year<00:02:26.709> then<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.950> think<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.519> will<00:02:28.940> go<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.239> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
next year then I think we will go to a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.039 
next year then I think we will go to a
mid-range<00:02:29.840> camera<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.769> if<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.849> DSLR<00:02:32.390> we

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
mid-range camera and if it's DSLR we

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.580 
mid-range camera and if it's DSLR we
don't<00:02:33.230> know<00:02:33.349> at<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.650> moment<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:36.380> not

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
don't know at the moment but it's not

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.860 
don't know at the moment but it's not
sure<00:02:36.799> if<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.190> will<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:38.060> suppressed

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
sure if there will be a suppressed

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.009
