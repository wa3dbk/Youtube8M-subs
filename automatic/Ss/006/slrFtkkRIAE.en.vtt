can you see that all right okay gotcha
that<00:02:25.610> shows<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.300> which<00:02:26.510> which<00:02:26.900> tire<00:02:27.260> was<00:02:27.620> like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
that shows you which which tire was like

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.920 
that shows you which which tire was like
yeah<00:02:28.520> how<00:02:28.670> much<00:02:28.820> air<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.090> left<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.720> tire

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
yeah how much air is left in the tire

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.570 
yeah how much air is left in the tire
there's<00:02:30.260> an<00:02:30.380> icon<00:02:30.530> down<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.340> looks<00:02:31.520> like

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
there's an icon down here it looks like

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.760 
there's an icon down here it looks like
a<00:02:31.700> blowout<00:02:32.030> essentially<00:02:32.960> saying<00:02:33.200> get<00:02:33.380> off<00:02:33.410> the

a blowout essentially saying get off the
road<00:02:33.980> right<00:02:34.580> you've<00:02:34.850> got<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> problem<00:02:35.270> it's<00:02:35.540> a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
road right you've got a problem it's a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.570 
road right you've got a problem it's a

under<00:02:38.420> normal<00:02:38.720> operating<00:02:39.350> condition<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.610> can

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
under normal operating condition you can

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.670 
under normal operating condition you can
see<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.150> tire<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.540> down<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.870> nineteen<00:02:42.320> point

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
see this tire is down to nineteen point

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.710 
see this tire is down to nineteen point
seven<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:44.060> because<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.510> golf

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
seven now that's because it's a golf

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.520 
seven now that's because it's a golf
cart<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.180> will<00:02:47.300> reflect<00:02:47.570> true<00:02:47.870> front<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
cart but it will reflect true front the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.430 
cart but it will reflect true front the
true<00:02:48.709> pressure<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.190> each<00:02:49.310> tire<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.959> press<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
true pressure of each tire you press it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.449 
true pressure of each tire you press it
one<00:02:51.650> time<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.550> shows<00:02:52.940> 73<00:02:53.900> degrees<00:02:54.770> that's<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
one time it shows 73 degrees that's the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.610 
one time it shows 73 degrees that's the
temperature<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.240> time<00:02:56.450> beam<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:57.110> monitor

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
temperature of the time beam we monitor

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.949 
temperature of the time beam we monitor
the<00:02:57.800> tires<00:02:58.010> temperature<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.970> pressure

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
the tires temperature and pressure

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.220 
the tires temperature and pressure
so<00:03:00.230> your<00:03:00.650> first<00:03:01.030> critical<00:03:02.030> error<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.690> warning

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
so your first critical error of warning

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.650 
so your first critical error of warning
is<00:03:03.410> air<00:03:03.980> loss<00:03:04.340> rapid<00:03:04.940> air<00:03:05.060> loss<00:03:05.270> leaving

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
is air loss rapid air loss leaving

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.229 
is air loss rapid air loss leaving
second<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.260> if<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.620> tire<00:03:06.830> overheats<00:03:07.340> right<00:03:07.760> all

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
second is if a tire overheats right all

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.430 
second is if a tire overheats right all
right<00:03:08.360> because<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.959> wanted<00:03:09.290> first

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
right because it wanted first

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.420 
right because it wanted first
temperature<00:03:10.010> at<00:03:10.160> 73<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.360> goes<00:03:11.600> up<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.430> 165

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
temperature at 73 this goes up to 165

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.729 
temperature at 73 this goes up to 165
degrees<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.600> get<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.900> same<00:03:15.110> warning<00:03:15.320> red

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
degrees you get the same warning red

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.550 
degrees you get the same warning red
light<00:03:16.010> beeping<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.030> huge<00:03:17.450> tire<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.930> overheated

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
light beeping so huge tire is overheated

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.170 
light beeping so huge tire is overheated
so<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.160> only<00:03:19.190> get<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.519> visual<00:03:19.850> but<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.060> get

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
so you not only get a visual but you get

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.960 
so you not only get a visual but you get
an<00:03:20.269> audible<00:03:20.720> alarm<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.230> well<00:03:21.410> absolutely<00:03:21.970> one

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
an audible alarm as well absolutely one
