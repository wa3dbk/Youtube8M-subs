come here and tell you guys I'm going to
challenge<00:00:31.199> myself<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.890> create<00:00:33.230> lots<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
challenge myself to create lots of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.549 
challenge myself to create lots of
designs<00:00:35.070> using<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:35.989> stamping<00:00:36.989> plates<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
designs using these stamping plates and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.840 
designs using these stamping plates and
sometimes<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.129> easier<00:00:38.399> using<00:00:38.610> these

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
sometimes it's easier using these

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.200 
sometimes it's easier using these
because<00:00:39.379> especially<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.890> there's<00:00:41.309> lace

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
because especially for like there's lace

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.819 
because especially for like there's lace
designs<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> stuff<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.620> just

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
designs and stuff like that it's just

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.600 
designs and stuff like that it's just
much<00:00:44.070> easier<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> stamping<00:00:45.539> plate

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
much easier to have a stamping plate

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
much easier to have a stamping plate
rather<00:00:47.610> than<00:00:47.850> having<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> freehand<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:50.510> just

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
rather than having to freehand it just

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.400 
rather than having to freehand it just
much<00:00:51.840> easier<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.730> much<00:00:54.030> tighter<00:00:54.960> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
much easier and it's much tighter and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.330 
much easier and it's much tighter and
cleaner<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:57.500> no<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.739> right<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.219> at

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
