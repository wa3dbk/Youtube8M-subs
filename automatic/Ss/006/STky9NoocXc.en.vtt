00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that's how the shield is working it's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
that's how the shield is working it's
working<00:01:08.250> great<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
working great but you can see the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
working great but you can see the
corners<00:01:10.710> peel<00:01:10.950> back<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
corners peel back because that's the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
corners peel back because that's the
corner<00:01:12.150> i<00:01:12.210> chose<00:01:12.510> once<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> take<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.650> thing

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
corner i chose once you take this thing

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
corner i chose once you take this thing
off<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.700> gotta<00:01:14.909> whatever<00:01:15.330> replacement

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
off you gotta whatever replacement

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240 
off you gotta whatever replacement
because<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> material<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> stretch

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
because the material is going to stretch

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.570 
because the material is going to stretch
but<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> does<00:01:18.330> protect<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.290> device<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
but it does protect the device if you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.950 
but it does protect the device if you
don't<00:01:20.759> believe<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:21.030> I'll<00:01:21.540> take<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:21.930> now

dongle<00:01:26.600> trying<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> scratch<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> heck<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
dongle trying to scratch the heck out of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
dongle trying to scratch the heck out of
it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.939> I'm<00:01:29.939> even<00:01:30.180> being<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.509> little<00:01:31.020> bit

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it and I'm even being a little bit

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.359 
it and I'm even being a little bit
cautious<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.829> when<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.189> air

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
cautious because when you have air

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
cautious because when you have air
bubbles<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.119> caught<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.110> but

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
bubbles it could get caught you know but

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
bubbles it could get caught you know but
again<00:01:35.400> nothing<00:01:36.030> wrong<00:01:36.420> with<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> screen<00:01:37.049> at

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
again nothing wrong with the screen at

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.300 
again nothing wrong with the screen at
all<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.049> costly<00:01:40.530> compared<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
all so I know the costly compared to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
all so I know the costly compared to
like<00:01:41.400> best<00:01:41.640> skins<00:01:41.909> ever<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> stuff<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.170> until

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
like best skins ever and stuff but until

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.980 
like best skins ever and stuff but until
i<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.100> problem<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.000> device<00:01:45.329> i'm<00:01:45.810> not

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
i have a problem with the device i'm not

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.330 
i have a problem with the device i'm not
going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> crease<00:01:46.799> i<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.250> in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
going to see the crease i just put in

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.850 
going to see the crease i just put in
because<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.640> didn't<00:01:47.790> take<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> air<00:01:48.119> bubble<00:01:48.390> out

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
because i didn't take the air bubble out

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.850 
because i didn't take the air bubble out
so<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> new<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.680> elbow

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so when I get the new one the only elbow

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.969 
so when I get the new one the only elbow

now<00:03:59.400> another<00:03:59.940> problem<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.450> when<00:04:00.990> you<00:04:01.080> get<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.350> a

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
now another problem is when you get to a

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.980 
now another problem is when you get to a
phone<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> envy<00:04:02.340> touch<00:04:02.700> all<00:04:03.570> these

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
phone like the envy touch all these

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.760 
phone like the envy touch all these
pieces<00:04:04.320> are<00:04:04.820> separate<00:04:05.820> pieces<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.959> you're

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
pieces are separate pieces and you're

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.170 
pieces are separate pieces and you're
basically<00:04:08.100> sitting<00:04:08.550> here<00:04:08.790> trying<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.090> figure

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
basically sitting here trying to figure

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.390 
basically sitting here trying to figure
out<00:04:09.390> where<00:04:09.660> what<00:04:10.020> goes<00:04:10.170> where<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:11.190> not

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
out where what goes where it's not

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.570 
out where what goes where it's not
always<00:04:11.700> clear<00:04:12.030> cut<00:04:13.250> with<00:04:14.250> some<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.489> these

always clear cut with some of these

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.860 
always clear cut with some of these
devices<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:17.340> reason<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.669> don't<00:04:17.730> use<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
devices so the reason I don't use the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.930 
devices so the reason I don't use the
