I<00:00:04.370> like<00:00:05.370> my<00:00:05.640> little<00:00:06.390> small<00:00:06.750> staging<00:00:07.290> area<00:00:07.560> food

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
I like my little small staging area food

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.209 
I like my little small staging area food
plots<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.400> talked<00:00:09.150> just<00:00:09.480> inside<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.929> cover

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
plots to be talked just inside the cover

from<00:00:11.219> where<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> deer<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.790> going<00:00:12.030> out<00:00:12.179> into

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
from where the deer are going out into

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
from where the deer are going out into
the<00:00:12.570> bigger<00:00:12.719> areas<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.259> feed<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.860> way<00:00:13.980> they

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
the bigger areas to feed that way they

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
the bigger areas to feed that way they
serve<00:00:14.280> as<00:00:14.460> these<00:00:14.610> perfect<00:00:14.940> little<00:00:15.150> staging

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
serve as these perfect little staging

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.920 
serve as these perfect little staging
areas<00:00:16.190> poor<00:00:17.190> man<00:00:17.340> plot<00:00:17.609> anywhere<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
areas poor man plot anywhere up to a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.810 
areas poor man plot anywhere up to a
half<00:00:19.230> an<00:00:19.410> acre<00:00:19.529> that'd<00:00:20.039> be<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> pretty<00:00:20.400> big<00:00:20.640> one

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
half an acre that'd be a pretty big one

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
half an acre that'd be a pretty big one
but<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.570> one's<00:00:21.779> probably<00:00:21.930> about<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> quarter

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
but this one's probably about a quarter

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.070 
but this one's probably about a quarter
acre<00:00:22.859> which<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> ideal<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.630> handle<00:00:24.930> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
acre which is ideal you can handle that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
acre which is ideal you can handle that
fairly<00:00:25.439> well<00:00:25.470> first<00:00:26.369> step<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.760> gonna<00:00:27.029> be

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
fairly well first step now is gonna be

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.750 
fairly well first step now is gonna be
to<00:00:27.240> clear<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.980> get<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> brush<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
to clear it and get all the brush and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640 
to clear it and get all the brush and
the<00:00:29.849> small<00:00:30.060> trees<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> stuff<00:00:30.660> out<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the small trees and stuff out of it and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.049 
the small trees and stuff out of it and
while<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.949> doing<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.250> I'll<00:00:32.489> talk<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:32.910> more

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
while I'm doing that I'll talk some more

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
while I'm doing that I'll talk some more
about<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:34.020> whole<00:00:34.200> strategy<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:35.130> start<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
about the whole strategy from start to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.670 
about the whole strategy from start to
finish<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.969> creating<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.870> poor<00:00:37.320> man<00:00:37.469> food

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
finish on creating these poor man food

00:00:37.680 --> 00:01:06.680 
finish on creating these poor man food
plots

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.420 

basically<00:01:07.690> all<00:01:07.900> I'm<00:01:08.020> doing<00:01:08.380> in<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:09.220> stage

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
basically all I'm doing in this stage

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.730 
basically all I'm doing in this stage
with<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> chainsaw<00:01:10.230> has<00:01:11.230> taken<00:01:11.590> out<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
with the chainsaw has taken out the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.550 
with the chainsaw has taken out the
stuff<00:01:12.130> that's<00:01:12.910> really<00:01:13.300> too<00:01:13.570> big<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.020> burn<00:01:14.260> down

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
stuff that's really too big to burn down

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
stuff that's really too big to burn down
and<00:01:15.220> by<00:01:16.060> burn<00:01:16.270> down<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:17.590> kind<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.830> two

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and by burn down there's kind of two

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150 
and by burn down there's kind of two
stages<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.360> that<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:20.560> one<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> chemical

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
stages to that first one is the chemical

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.070 
stages to that first one is the chemical
burned<00:01:21.460> down<00:01:21.640> with<00:01:22.270> Roundup<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:22.900> then<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
burned down with Roundup and then the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.600 
burned down with Roundup and then the
second<00:01:23.410> one<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.770> actual<00:01:24.040> physical<00:01:24.430> burn

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
second one is the actual physical burn

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.390 
second one is the actual physical burn
down<00:01:24.820> where<00:01:25.690> we'll<00:01:25.840> come<00:01:26.020> back<00:01:26.200> in<00:01:26.440> ten<00:01:27.250> days

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
down where we'll come back in ten days

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.390 
down where we'll come back in ten days
to<00:01:27.670> two<00:01:27.820> weeks<00:01:28.350> after<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.380> spray<00:01:29.800> this<00:01:30.040> I'll

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
to two weeks after I spray this I'll

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.910 
to two weeks after I spray this I'll
spray<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.700> today<00:01:31.440> we'll<00:01:32.440> come<00:01:32.560> back<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.830> a

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
spray it today we'll come back in a

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.460 
spray it today we'll come back in a
couple<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.250> weeks<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.780> grass<00:01:35.080> and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
couple of weeks all this grass and

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.920 
couple of weeks all this grass and
leaves<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:36.040> stuff<00:01:36.670> will<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.000> dead<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.870> we'll

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
leaves and stuff will be dead and we'll

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.109 
leaves and stuff will be dead and we'll
catch<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.229> nice<00:01:38.380> dry<00:01:38.619> day<00:01:38.680> so<00:01:39.430> that<00:01:39.610> it'll<00:01:39.940> burn

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
catch a nice dry day so that it'll burn

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.120 
catch a nice dry day so that it'll burn
well<00:01:40.390> we'll<00:01:41.140> start<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> little<00:01:41.560> small<00:01:41.740> fire<00:01:41.979> and

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
well we'll start a little small fire and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.440 
well we'll start a little small fire and
we'll<00:01:42.220> just<00:01:42.340> burn<00:01:42.550> all<00:01:42.729> this<00:01:42.880> stuff<00:01:43.090> right<00:01:43.270> off

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
we'll just burn all this stuff right off

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.109 
we'll just burn all this stuff right off
so<00:01:44.259> we<00:01:44.350> don't<00:01:44.530> have<00:01:44.680> to<00:01:44.920> necessarily<00:01:45.119> clean

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
so we don't have to necessarily clean

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.270 
so we don't have to necessarily clean
every<00:01:46.600> little<00:01:46.840> thing<00:01:47.080> out<00:01:47.290> but<00:01:47.920> there's<00:01:48.100> some

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
every little thing out but there's some

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.890 
every little thing out but there's some
things<00:01:48.460> here<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.640> are<00:01:49.060> too<00:01:49.180> big<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.390> burn<00:01:49.660> I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
things here that are too big to burn I

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.139 
things here that are too big to burn I
mean<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.259> tree<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.830> know<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:51.790> got<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:51.940> go

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
mean that tree you know it's got to go

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.040 
mean that tree you know it's got to go
that<00:01:52.600> one<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.869> mean<00:01:53.110> there's<00:01:53.550> there's<00:01:54.550> probably

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
that one I mean there's there's probably

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.320 
that one I mean there's there's probably
on<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.110> 50<00:01:56.530> more<00:01:56.740> little<00:01:57.610> trees<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:58.090> this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
on a 50 more little trees in this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.300 
on a 50 more little trees in this
quarter<00:01:58.720> acre<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.020> have<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.350> go<00:01:59.440> out<00:01:59.619> then

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
quarter acre that have to go out then

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.680 
quarter acre that have to go out then
after<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.759> mean<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.180> kind<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.450> stuff

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
after that I mean this kind of stuff

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.980 
after that I mean this kind of stuff
here<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:03.280> spray<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.700> with<00:02:03.820> Roundup<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.899> I

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
here I can spray that with Roundup and I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.020 
here I can spray that with Roundup and I
can<00:02:05.170> kill<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.860> it'll<00:02:06.490> burn<00:02:06.640> right<00:02:06.670> up

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
can kill that and it'll burn right up

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.850 
can kill that and it'll burn right up
when<00:02:07.540> we<00:02:07.630> bring<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.930> fire<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.619> couple

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
when we bring the fire to it in a couple

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.620 
when we bring the fire to it in a couple
of<00:02:08.920> weeks<00:02:09.040> after<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.429> well<00:02:10.360> that's<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
of weeks after that well that's the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.390 
of weeks after that well that's the
general<00:02:10.660> strategy<00:02:11.140> on<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.620> stage<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.220> going

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
general strategy on this stage I'm going

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:29.190 
general strategy on this stage I'm going
to<00:02:12.459> keep<00:02:12.610> cutting<00:02:12.820> some<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.090> these<00:02:13.239> down

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.260 

I've<00:02:30.200> got<00:02:30.410> about<00:02:30.530> 75%<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.670> brush<00:02:31.970> cleared

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
I've got about 75% of the brush cleared

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.410 
I've got about 75% of the brush cleared
off<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.720> poor<00:02:32.960> man's<00:02:33.140> plot<00:02:34.060> I've<00:02:35.060> got<00:02:35.270> this

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
off this poor man's plot I've got this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.750 
off this poor man's plot I've got this
edge<00:02:35.630> right<00:02:35.660> here<00:02:35.980> leading<00:02:36.980> down<00:02:37.250> into<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
edge right here leading down into this

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.530 
edge right here leading down into this
little<00:02:38.540> corner<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.470> clean<00:02:39.709> up<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:41.240> then<00:02:41.420> I'm

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
little corner to clean up and then I'm

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.320 
little corner to clean up and then I'm
gonna<00:02:41.660> move<00:02:42.620> on<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> next<00:02:43.130> stage<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.180> let's

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
gonna move on to the next stage so let's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.170 
gonna move on to the next stage so let's
talk<00:02:44.480> about<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:45.980> what<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.580> stages<00:02:47.000> are

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
talk about right now what the stages are

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.500 
talk about right now what the stages are
for<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.110> poor<00:02:48.260> man<00:02:48.410> plot<00:02:48.970> obviously<00:02:49.970> location

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
for the poor man plot obviously location

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.090 
for the poor man plot obviously location
we've<00:02:50.990> talked<00:02:51.200> about<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.620> couple<00:02:51.800> of

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
we've talked about that a couple of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.600 
we've talked about that a couple of
times

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
times

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.210 
times
number<00:02:53.390> two<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.810> clear<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.290> number<00:02:54.920> three

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
number two is to clear it number three

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.780 
number two is to clear it number three
spray<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.380> then<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.470> wait<00:02:57.680> you've<00:02:58.520> got<00:02:58.550> about

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
spray it then you wait you've got about

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.360 
spray it then you wait you've got about
a<00:02:58.940> ten<00:02:59.330> day<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.570> two-week<00:03:00.020> period<00:03:00.470> there<00:03:00.680> for

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
a ten day to two-week period there for

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.340 
a ten day to two-week period there for
everything<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.940> really<00:03:02.270> die<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.050> dry<00:03:03.290> down

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
everything to really die and dry down

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.790 
everything to really die and dry down
and<00:03:04.040> for<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.910> fire<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.150> work<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:06.260> has<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.500> be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
and for the fire to work it has to be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.830 
and for the fire to work it has to be
dry<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.580> can't<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:08.060> be<00:03:08.239> dead

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
dry you can't just be dead

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.620 
dry you can't just be dead
a<00:03:09.280> lot<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.340> times<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.700> roundup<00:03:11.150> will<00:03:11.330> do<00:03:11.600> a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
a lot of times that roundup will do a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.300 
a lot of times that roundup will do a
nice<00:03:11.810> enough<00:03:12.110> job<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.350> killing<00:03:12.739> within<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.160> few

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
nice enough job of killing within a few

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.460 
nice enough job of killing within a few
days<00:03:13.520> that<00:03:13.550> if<00:03:13.940> you're<00:03:14.030> gonna<00:03:14.209> kill<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.750> you

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
days that if you're gonna kill it up you

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.660 
days that if you're gonna kill it up you
could<00:03:15.680> till<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:15.980> up<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.160> little<00:03:16.220> bit<00:03:16.400> early

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
could till it up a little bit early

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.610 
could till it up a little bit early
without<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.060> plant<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.930> know<00:03:18.050> having<00:03:18.350> gone

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
without the plant you know having gone

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.960 
without the plant you know having gone
through<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.980> whole<00:03:19.220> cycle<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:19.730> turning

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
through that whole cycle and turning

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.370 
through that whole cycle and turning
brown<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.690> when<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:20.930> burning<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.260> with

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
brown but when you're burning it with

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.810 
brown but when you're burning it with
fire<00:03:21.560> you've<00:03:21.800> got<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.100> get<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.310> all<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.730> way

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
fire you've got to get it all the way

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.100 
fire you've got to get it all the way
Browns<00:03:23.060> so<00:03:23.330> you're<00:03:23.450> looking<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> couple<00:03:23.959> of

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
Browns so you're looking at a couple of

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.080 
Browns so you're looking at a couple of
weeks<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.980> then<00:03:25.130> after<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.580> comes<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.880> real

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
weeks and then after that comes the real

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.720 
weeks and then after that comes the real
fun<00:03:26.330> part<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.840> that's<00:03:27.440> raking<00:03:27.950> anything

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
fun part and that's raking anything

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.310 
fun part and that's raking anything
that's<00:03:28.880> left<00:03:29.090> down<00:03:29.269> here<00:03:29.510> we<00:03:29.630> rake<00:03:29.840> through<00:03:30.140> it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
that's left down here we rake through it

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.570 
that's left down here we rake through it
and<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.830> creates<00:03:31.160> enough<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:33.400> texture<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
and that creates enough of a texture to

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.220 
and that creates enough of a texture to
the<00:03:34.730> surface<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.420> ground<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.110> you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
the surface of the ground that when you

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.320 
the surface of the ground that when you
spread<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> seed<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.400> it's<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.209> be

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
spread the seed on it it's going to be

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.300 
spread the seed on it it's going to be
able<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.480> work<00:03:38.660> its<00:03:38.840> way<00:03:39.019> through<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.739> very

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
able to work its way through that very

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.220 
able to work its way through that very
top<00:03:40.610> layer<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.330> get<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.810> little<00:03:41.959> bit<00:03:42.080> better

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
top layer and get a little bit better

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.460 
top layer and get a little bit better
seed<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.650> soil<00:03:42.799> contact<00:03:42.920> when<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.580> rains<00:03:43.760> come

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
seed to soil contact when the rains come

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.850 
seed to soil contact when the rains come
so<00:03:45.470> after<00:03:46.459> raking<00:03:46.670> we<00:03:47.600> spread<00:03:47.989> fertilizer<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
so after raking we spread fertilizer and

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.860 
so after raking we spread fertilizer and
we<00:03:48.920> spread<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.280> seed<00:03:49.600> I'm<00:03:50.600> going<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> be

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
we spread the seed I'm going to be

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.810 
we spread the seed I'm going to be
putting<00:03:51.049> wild<00:03:51.410> game<00:03:51.590> buffet<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.579> one

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
putting wild game buffet in this one

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.490 
putting wild game buffet in this one
from<00:03:53.060> frigate<00:03:53.450> forage<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.019> it's<00:03:54.440> a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
from frigate forage and it's a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.650 
from frigate forage and it's a
combination<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:55.100> clover<00:03:55.610> with<00:03:56.480> some

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
combination of clover with some

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.259 
combination of clover with some
brassicas<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.350> it<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.060> that's<00:03:59.060> going<00:03:59.209> to

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
brassicas in it and that's going to

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.789 
brassicas in it and that's going to
create<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.600> nice<00:03:59.840> because<00:04:00.290> I'm<00:04:00.380> not<00:04:00.470> gonna<00:04:00.650> come

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
create a nice because I'm not gonna come

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.020 
create a nice because I'm not gonna come
in<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:00.950> mow<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.220> thing<00:04:01.400> right<00:04:01.579> away<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:01.820> it's

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
in to mow this thing right away so it's

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.479 
in to mow this thing right away so it's
gonna<00:04:02.120> create<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.450> nice<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:03.489> transitional

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
gonna create a nice little transitional

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.180 
gonna create a nice little transitional
food<00:04:05.090> plot<00:04:05.390> with<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.170> brassicas<00:04:06.709> coming<00:04:07.010> up<00:04:07.130> a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
food plot with the brassicas coming up a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.830

Poorman plot twice now we've had them
both<00:04:15.350> drought<00:04:15.769> out<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.400> mean<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.729> doesn't<00:04:16.880> mean

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
both drought out I mean it doesn't mean

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.060 
both drought out I mean it doesn't mean
that<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.959> work<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.169> we<00:04:18.380> did<00:04:18.500> clearing<00:04:18.919> it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
that the work that we did clearing it

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.310 
that the work that we did clearing it
was<00:04:19.220> wasted<00:04:19.700> but<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.450> seedings<00:04:20.840> themselves

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
was wasted but the seedings themselves

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.870 
was wasted but the seedings themselves
didn't<00:04:21.590> take<00:04:21.739> because<00:04:21.950> they<00:04:22.100> were<00:04:22.280> on<00:04:22.400> ridges

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880

in the two droughts we've had these past
two<00:04:25.280> summers<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.760> basically<00:04:26.060> killed<00:04:26.479> those

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
two summers have basically killed those

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.960 
two summers have basically killed those
poor<00:04:26.900> man<00:04:27.080> plots<00:04:27.350> so<00:04:28.160> before<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.610> spring<00:04:28.850> is

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
poor man plots so before the spring is

poor man plots so before the spring is
over<00:04:29.060> we're<00:04:29.240> gonna<00:04:29.330> go<00:04:29.510> back<00:04:29.630> in<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:29.960> get

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
over we're gonna go back in and get

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.390 
over we're gonna go back in and get
those<00:04:30.200> things<00:04:30.380> kind<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.710> refreshed<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.280> ready

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
those things kind of refreshed and ready

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.400 
those things kind of refreshed and ready
to<00:04:31.490> go<00:04:31.669> again<00:04:31.700> -<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.390> don't<00:04:32.900> want<00:04:33.020> all<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.260> work

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
to go again - I don't want all the work

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.230 
to go again - I don't want all the work
that<00:04:33.590> we<00:04:33.680> did<00:04:33.830> doing<00:04:34.190> all<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.400> clearing<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:35.000> go

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
that we did doing all the clearing to go

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.430 
that we did doing all the clearing to go
to

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
to

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.740 
to
waste<00:04:35.910> plus<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.030> want<00:04:37.180> to<00:04:37.240> build<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.450> hunt<00:04:37.600> over

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
waste plus I want to build the hunt over

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.170 
waste plus I want to build the hunt over
those<00:04:37.870> spots<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.550> plan<00:04:39.760> here

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
those spots so that's the plan here

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.810 
those spots so that's the plan here
that's<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:41.140> whole<00:04:41.350> plan<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.680> guess<00:04:41.920> to<00:04:42.700> how

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
that's the whole plan I guess to how

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.360 
that's the whole plan I guess to how
these<00:04:43.030> projects<00:04:43.930> work<00:04:44.170> we<00:04:44.830> call<00:04:45.040> them<00:04:45.190> poor

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
these projects work we call them poor

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.220 
these projects work we call them poor
man<00:04:45.580> plots<00:04:45.880> because<00:04:46.060> we<00:04:46.300> don't<00:04:46.450> use<00:04:46.660> very<00:04:46.930> much

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
man plots because we don't use very much

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.020 
man plots because we don't use very much
power<00:04:47.440> equipment<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.400> only<00:04:48.610> thing<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:48.910> has

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
power equipment the only thing that has

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.880 
power equipment the only thing that has
motor<00:04:49.300> in<00:04:49.480> it<00:04:49.600> is<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:49.870> chainsaw<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:50.710> that's

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
motor in it is that chainsaw so that's

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.160 
motor in it is that chainsaw so that's
kind<00:04:51.160> of<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.430> why<00:04:52.120> we<00:04:52.330> say<00:04:52.540> these<00:04:52.780> things<00:04:52.990> can

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
kind of the why we say these things can

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.890 
kind of the why we say these things can
be<00:04:53.260> produced<00:04:53.620> really<00:04:54.160> by<00:04:54.370> anybody<00:04:54.900> almost

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
be produced really by anybody almost

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.420 
be produced really by anybody almost
anywhere<00:04:56.320> obviously<00:04:57.100> you<00:04:57.160> gotta<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.400> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
anywhere obviously you gotta have a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.370 
anywhere obviously you gotta have a
little<00:04:57.610> small<00:04:57.760> clearing<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.180> start<00:04:58.420> with<00:04:58.570> but

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
little small clearing to start with but

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.460 
little small clearing to start with but
uh<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.980> know<00:05:00.070> if<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.280> can<00:05:00.460> do<00:05:00.610> this<00:05:01.110> being<00:05:02.110> 50

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
uh you know if I can do this being 50

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.360 
uh you know if I can do this being 50

I'm<00:05:06.370> pretty<00:05:06.610> sure<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.150> do<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.360> too

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
I'm pretty sure that you can do it too

I'm pretty sure that you can do it too
and<00:05:07.720> they're<00:05:08.350> not<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.560> expensive<00:05:08.620> it's

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
and they're not that expensive it's

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.710 
and they're not that expensive it's
something<00:05:09.970> that's<00:05:10.150> really<00:05:10.180> going<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.570> improve

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
something that's really going to improve
