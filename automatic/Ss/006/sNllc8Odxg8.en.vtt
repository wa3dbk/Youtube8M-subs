00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.920 

so<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.000> just<00:00:06.120> want<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.330> make<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> quick<00:00:06.720> video

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
so I just want to make a quick video

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.700 
so I just want to make a quick video
about<00:00:07.880> something<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.000> particular<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.230> 20

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
about something in particular on the 20

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.509 
about something in particular on the 20
valve<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:11.309> AG<00:00:11.880> engines<00:00:12.889> these<00:00:13.889> engines<00:00:14.250> have

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
valve for AG engines these engines have

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.930 
valve for AG engines these engines have
on<00:00:14.849> idle<00:00:15.570> air<00:00:15.750> control<00:00:16.340> which<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.580> unit

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
on idle air control which is this unit

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.929 
on idle air control which is this unit
right<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.070> this<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
right here and this is a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.870 
right here and this is a
computer-controlled<00:00:21.510> air<00:00:22.260> bypass<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.820> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
computer-controlled air bypass so as you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.429 
computer-controlled air bypass so as you
can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.390> there's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> big<00:00:24.750> black<00:00:25.170> tube

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
can see here there's a big black tube

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.259 
can see here there's a big black tube
that<00:00:25.680> comes<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.300> goes<00:00:27.480> into<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
that comes out and it goes into the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.700 
that comes out and it goes into the
intake<00:00:30.269> manifold<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> air

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
intake manifold here and this is the air

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
intake manifold here and this is the air
bypass<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> increase<00:00:34.050> your<00:00:36.110> ear

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
bypass and this is to increase your ear

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.479 
bypass and this is to increase your ear
our<00:00:37.290> car<00:00:37.440> revs<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.270> engines<00:00:39.570> cold

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
our car revs and when your engines cold

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
our car revs and when your engines cold
so<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> warm<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> engine<00:00:42.660> faster

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so that you warm up the engine faster

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
so that you warm up the engine faster
and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> ending<00:00:44.610> gets<00:00:44.760> warmer<00:00:45.090> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and then as the ending gets warmer this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.360 
and then as the ending gets warmer this
thing<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:45.690> start<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> close<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
thing should start to close and you

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
thing should start to close and you
don't<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.730> extra<00:00:48.149> air<00:00:48.270> bypassing<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
don't need that extra air bypassing the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.250 
don't need that extra air bypassing the
throttle<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:50.670> artificially<00:00:51.570> increase<00:00:52.039> your

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
throttle to artificially increase your

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.450 
throttle to artificially increase your
rpms

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
rpms

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
rpms
however<00:00:56.460> mine<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:57.109> malfunctioning<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
however mine was malfunctioning so it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.330 
however mine was malfunctioning so it
actually<00:00:58.770> would<00:00:59.039> never<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.550> down<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> I'd

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
actually would never go down so I'd

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
actually would never go down so I'd
always<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.059> high<00:01:03.239> idle<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.780> at

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
always have a really high idle like at

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.160 
always have a really high idle like at
1,800<00:01:04.769> 2,000<00:01:05.309> rpm<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.689> too<00:01:06.750> high

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
1,800 2,000 rpm which is way too high

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.010 
1,800 2,000 rpm which is way too high
when<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> engines<00:01:07.799> warm<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> solve<00:01:09.810> this

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
when the engines warm so to solve this

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
when the engines warm so to solve this
without<00:01:10.380> actually<00:01:10.650> having<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.100> take<00:01:11.310> apart

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
without actually having to take apart

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
without actually having to take apart
this<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.299> I'm<00:01:12.780> air<00:01:13.200> bypass<00:01:13.710> valve<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.780> mean<00:01:16.409> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this and I'm air bypass valve I mean you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
this and I'm air bypass valve I mean you
can<00:01:16.619> take<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.770> apart<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.340> fix<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> can

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
can take it apart you can fix it you can

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.039 
can take it apart you can fix it you can
replace<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.509> they're<00:01:18.630> probably<00:01:18.750> quite

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
replace it they're probably quite

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.070 
replace it they're probably quite
expensive<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> easier<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
expensive but the easier way is what I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
expensive but the easier way is what I
did<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.340> remove<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.750> tube<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.820> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
did was just remove this tube and I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.289 
did was just remove this tube and I
taped<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.659> washer<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> tube

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
taped a washer and then put the tube

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
taped a washer and then put the tube
back<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.079> washer<00:01:31.530> basically

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
back on so this washer basically

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.609 
back on so this washer basically
restricts<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> air<00:01:32.790> flow<00:01:33.259> by<00:01:34.259> restricting

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
restricts the air flow by restricting

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
restricts the air flow by restricting
the<00:01:34.890> diameter<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.729> tube<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.479> see

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the diameter of that tube so you can see

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
the diameter of that tube so you can see
this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> quite<00:01:37.049> large<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.650> tube<00:01:37.890> diameter

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this is quite large this tube diameter

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
this is quite large this tube diameter
and<00:01:38.970> I'm<00:01:39.630> restricting<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> by<00:01:40.380> putting<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and I'm restricting it by putting this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
and I'm restricting it by putting this
washer<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> tape<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
washer right there the tape is just to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.899 
washer right there the tape is just to
hold<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.680> place<00:01:43.799> while<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.130> install<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
hold it in place while I install the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.830 
hold it in place while I install the
I'll<00:01:46.150> install<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.689> rubber<00:01:46.869> hose<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.720> what

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
I'll install the rubber hose so what

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.899 
I'll install the rubber hose so what
happens<00:01:50.140> when<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.430> when

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
happens when you do this is that when

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.990 
happens when you do this is that when
your<00:01:52.030> engine<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.360> cold<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:54.250> air<00:01:54.310> bypass<00:01:54.790> is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
your engine is cold the air bypass is

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.910 
your engine is cold the air bypass is
restricted<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:55.720> your<00:01:55.869> engine<00:01:56.200> idles<00:01:56.470> very<00:01:56.680> low

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
restricted so your engine idles very low

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.190 
restricted so your engine idles very low
and<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:58.090> need<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.299> let<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.540> engine<00:01:58.810> warm<00:01:59.049> up

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and you need to let the engine warm up

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.359 
and you need to let the engine warm up
naturally<00:02:00.540> eventually<00:02:01.540> warm<00:02:01.750> up<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.140> your

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
naturally eventually warm up and your

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.639 
naturally eventually warm up and your
idle<00:02:03.369> rpm<00:02:03.759> will<00:02:03.909> increase<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:05.320> your

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
idle rpm will increase and then your

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.190 
idle rpm will increase and then your
warm<00:02:06.100> idle<00:02:06.549> will<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.820> normal<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.420> know<00:02:07.600> at<00:02:08.170> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
warm idle will be normal you know at a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.400 
warm idle will be normal you know at a
thousand<00:02:08.619> rpm<00:02:08.950> or<00:02:09.069> whatever<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.319> to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
thousand rpm or whatever so you have to

this<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.160> really<00:02:36.310> quick<00:02:36.489> fix<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
this is just a really quick fix that I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.910 
this is just a really quick fix that I
figured<00:02:37.390> worked<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.239> costs<00:02:40.630> nothing<00:02:41.380> this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
figured worked and it costs nothing this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.289 
figured worked and it costs nothing this
is<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.250> cost<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.700> washer<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:45.120> keep<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.239> in

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
is the cost of a washer so keep that in

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.799 
is the cost of a washer so keep that in
mind<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.410> problem
