cutter when the router is set up with a
guide<00:00:59.670> Bush<00:01:00.499> so<00:01:01.499> there's<00:01:01.889> a<00:01:01.979> little<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
of the straight cutter and the guide

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.249 
of the straight cutter and the guide
brush<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:10.619> are<00:01:10.829> variables<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.579> course<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
brush these are variables of course and

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.029 
brush these are variables of course and
each<00:01:13.259> template<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.329> coded<00:01:15.329> to<00:01:15.930> match<00:01:16.350> your

each template can be coded to match your

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.170 
each template can be coded to match your
router<00:01:17.280> setup<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.310> easy<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> use<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
router setup it's so easy to use and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.569 
router setup it's so easy to use and
obviously<00:01:21.270> when<00:01:21.750> cutting<00:01:21.990> dovetails<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.340> use

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
obviously when cutting dovetails you use

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.789 
obviously when cutting dovetails you use
a<00:01:23.610> straight<00:01:24.000> cutter<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> pins<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a straight cutter for the pins and a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
a straight cutter for the pins and a
dovetail<00:01:26.009> cutter<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:26.850> tail<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:28.590> mortise

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
dovetail cutter for the tail for mortise

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
dovetail cutter for the tail for mortise
and<00:01:29.100> tenon<00:01:29.430> joints<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.119> simple

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and tenon joints a very simple

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.599 
and tenon joints a very simple
additional<00:01:31.289> jig<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> made<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
additional jig can be made for the

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:35.719 
additional jig can be made for the
mortises<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.500> doweling<00:01:35.039> jig<00:01:35.340> for

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
mortises and so to a doweling jig for

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.609 
mortises and so to a doweling jig for
the<00:01:35.850> corresponding<00:01:36.600> rail<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.289> a<00:01:37.320> dowel

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the corresponding rail that a dowel

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.149 
the corresponding rail that a dowel
joint<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.369> twin<00:01:39.299> dowels<00:01:39.570> will<00:01:40.549> fit<00:01:41.549> into<00:01:43.159> all

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
joint or twin dowels will fit into all

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
joint or twin dowels will fit into all
you<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> guess<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
you have to do and I guess this is the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
you have to do and I guess this is the
only<00:01:46.170> limitation<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> jig<00:01:47.429> if<00:01:47.609> you<00:01:47.820> look

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
only limitation to the jig if you look

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.050 
only limitation to the jig if you look
at<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.289> decide<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> standard

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
at it this way is decide on a standard

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.029 
at it this way is decide on a standard
section<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.539> timber<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.079> make<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> jig<00:01:52.740> fit

section of timber to make the jig fit

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.399 
section of timber to make the jig fit
too<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> plainer<00:01:54.750> thickness<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
too if you have a plainer thickness so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.989 
too if you have a plainer thickness so
you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.829> prepare<00:01:56.189> your<00:01:56.399> own<00:01:56.579> wood<00:01:56.820> or
