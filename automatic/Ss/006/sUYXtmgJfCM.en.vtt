it's<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.989> real<00:02:21.439> natural<00:02:21.769> communication

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
it's just a real natural communication

I<00:02:24.370> think<00:02:25.370> Sarah<00:02:25.610> Hughes<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.480> those

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
I think Sarah Hughes is one of those

00:02:27.780 --> 00:03:04.730 
I think Sarah Hughes is one of those
natural<00:02:28.670> relationship<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> audience
