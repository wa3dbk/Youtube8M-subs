00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 thank you so much for welcoming us 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.269
 its on the sigma stand here at the show 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 of the photo so you have a news 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 with a new product to a new 24 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.460
 105 f 4 can you help us a little 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.650
 present it briefly 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
 yes so it's actually a new 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 zoom for full size standard zoom 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 for the full format that sigma has announced 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 there are two days before the show so 24 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 105 f 4 cars steady stabilize 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.680
 snowmobile are ultra are of course 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.950
 internal focus and so it's a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.960
 zoom that will be available from the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.690
 end of November 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 a price around 800 euros 850 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 Euro icon and perhaps for Christmas or 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 for the beginning of next year 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.469
 okay and so that's a goal that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.600
 so falls within the art range on the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.730
 new map is by the way 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 little rumors people speculate on the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.070
 range these gifts it's crazy soul art 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.010
 because in fact it's an ultra zoom 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.780
 qualitative designed for full boxes 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 format whose requirement today and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.490
 very high in terms of two sensors 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.650
 so it's a zoom really for high 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.979
 level of the requirement of the housings 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.630
 current 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.860
 so we were very pleasantly surprised 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 by the optical quality of the 18 35 f18 good 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.700
 for the shot for aps c sensor is this 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.619
 what can we expect with this new 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 objective the same level of quality at 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.840
 stake level so it's always 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.520
 very difficult to answer a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.439
 question like that already pleasantly 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.380
 impressed month calls us we did not 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.579
 not been surprised us but beyond the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.570
 joke I think we can 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.380
 expect a very high level 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.090
 qualitative 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.659
 absolutely it is still today 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.060
 the the the the direction and the requirement of 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.979
 sigma on all of this news 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
 lines and of course of course the range 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.070
 art does not align art 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 so yes we can hope for a very good 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.079
 qualitative level for this product 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.880
 absolutely so he yesterday you also have 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.560
 launched so an application so how 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.939
 it consists of tablets is his 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.439
 tablet exactly so we have 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.149
 currently two websites we have 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.549
 wanted to make an application that is 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.090
 more interactive playful also more 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.649
 didactics 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.239
 so in fact an application that 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.890
 is called sigma photo which is from 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.450
 already available on itunes that will be 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340
 very well 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.519
 very soon on android and so you 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.170
 can include a guide for 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.690
 well choose his goal which is a 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.690
 major concerns of our 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.120
 customers and users in this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.760
 application intended to present 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.340
 both user-friendly and 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.269
 interactive 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 needs analysis to choose well 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.420
 his goal with a great tool for the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 for the end of the year finally 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.239
 absolutely is an innovation since I 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.769
 believe it's still pretty 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.769
 original in our in our profession
