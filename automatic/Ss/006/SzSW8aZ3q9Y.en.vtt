00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 gta san andreas will soon be available for 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.540
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 more in the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.540
 following video 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.630
 There are several pointers to it 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.950
 suggest that gta san andreas soon for 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 reissued xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.810
 might even be with you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.770
 aufgehÃ¼bscht graphics who in any case 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 Pretty cool 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.500
 For one thing is on the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.800
 American side xbox edmonds one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 list of chapmans for gta san andreas 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 on the xbox 360 popped up the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 not familiar with this system 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 the chapmans are going to play new 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.909
 usually already in advance in the store 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.870
 integrated and such websites 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:57.780
 refer to output the data to the xbox live 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.900
 store for yes all achievements halt 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.140
 to cover and thereby became one too 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.379
 on these teams for gta san andreas 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.390
 attentively 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 Although there is currently a version 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.690
 by gta san andreas via xbox live this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 but is only as xbox original 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.750
 available and therefore does not support any 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.810
 elky fans also experimented rockstar 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.330
 currently with the pc version a bit 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.780
 around you can tell by the updates 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 steam and the playstation 2 version is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.880
 also no longer in the psn store 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.960
 available so the gas outlet variant 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.370
 where you gta san andreas just yet 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.410
 times in the market place could buy from the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.090
 playstation and that is now complete 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.680
 taken out 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.340
 And then of course there is the fact 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 that gta san andreas on 29 october 2004 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 for playstation 2 the first time 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.210
 has appeared so also is sometimes the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.460
 10 years anniversary before what, of course 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 also suggest a reprint 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.990
 could be what your opinion would be 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.180
 the gta san andreas like to go back 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.030
 the old one under quotes 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.810
 consoles so xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.409
 play 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.260
 or is enough for you the current version 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.610
 from gta san andreas and says that rocks 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 I prefer to work on other projects 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.879
 should focus 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.379
 like to write me your opinion 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.790
 It would also be cool if you had one 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.110
 could leave rating 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.790
 otherwise I say goodbye to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.790
 this video until next time
