friday and then if you want to throw in
an<00:01:53.850> accessory<00:01:54.360> day<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.689> saturday<00:01:55.229> where<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
an accessory day on saturday where you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
an accessory day on saturday where you
hit<00:01:55.740> minimal<00:01:56.399> body<00:01:56.579> parts<00:01:56.909> throughout<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
hit minimal body parts throughout the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.749 
hit minimal body parts throughout the
week<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.289> for<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.579> have

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
week you can go for it and then you have

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
week you can go for it and then you have
your<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.270> know<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.450> generic<00:02:00.960> upper<00:02:01.380> lower

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
your you know your generic upper lower

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.880 
your you know your generic upper lower
splits<00:02:02.070> higher<00:02:02.820> frequency<00:02:03.390> routines<00:02:03.890> which

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
splits higher frequency routines which

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
splits higher frequency routines which
are<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.070> lot<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.310> popular<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.180> think<00:02:06.390> Wayne

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
are a lot more popular and I think Wayne

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.260 
are a lot more popular and I think Wayne

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
training I think that really opened up

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070 
training I think that really opened up
as<00:02:14.460> far<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.910> hey<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.240> know<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.900> make

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
as far as hey you know you can make

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.710 
as far as hey you know you can make
better<00:02:16.350> games<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.070> hitting<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
better games you know hitting a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.290 
better games you know hitting a
part<00:02:17.990> two<00:02:18.140> times<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.530> week<00:02:18.880> now<00:02:19.880> let's<00:02:20.090> factor

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
part two times a week now let's factor

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.330 
part two times a week now let's factor
this<00:02:20.600> if<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.020> go<00:02:21.170> from<00:02:21.380> one<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.890> week<00:02:21.980> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
this if you go from one time a week to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
this if you go from one time a week to
multiple<00:02:22.730> times<00:02:22.910> per<00:02:23.060> week<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.960> that

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
multiple times per week the thing that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.290 
multiple times per week the thing that
has<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.410> change<00:02:24.520> one<00:02:25.520> your<00:02:25.730> frequency<00:02:26.210> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
has to change one your frequency you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.150 
has to change one your frequency you
hitting<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.690> more<00:02:26.840> times<00:02:27.110> your<00:02:27.800> overall

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
hitting it more times your overall

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.600 
hitting it more times your overall
volume<00:02:28.750> okay<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.200> may<00:02:30.320> do<00:02:30.380> 20<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.280> sets

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
volume okay you may do 20 or so sets

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.760 
volume okay you may do 20 or so sets
when<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.240> hit<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.660> time<00:02:32.690> week<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.680> if

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
when you hit it one time week but if

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.930 
when you hit it one time week but if
you're<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.100> hit<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.250> multiple<00:02:34.880> times

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
you're going to hit it multiple times

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.640 
you're going to hit it multiple times
week<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.660> have<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.960> lower<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.470> overall

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
week you have to lower the overall

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.920 
week you have to lower the overall
volume<00:02:37.100> or<00:02:37.880> else<00:02:38.150> you're<00:02:38.300> going<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.450> overtrain

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
volume or else you're going to overtrain

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.800 
volume or else you're going to overtrain
your<00:02:39.080> muscle<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:40.640> thing<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.240> factors<00:02:41.660> into

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
your muscle so a thing that factors into

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.320 
your muscle so a thing that factors into
this<00:02:42.020> with<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.500> bulking<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.250> cutting<00:02:43.370> again

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
this with is bulking and cutting again

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.790 
this with is bulking and cutting again
if<00:02:44.420> you're<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.720> caloric<00:02:45.050> deficit<00:02:45.530> it's

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
if you're in a caloric deficit it's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.050 
if you're in a caloric deficit it's
going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.130> be<00:02:46.220> harder<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.610> hit<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.880> more

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
going to be harder to hit it more

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.940 
going to be harder to hit it more
frequently<00:02:47.330> because<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.650> amount<00:02:48.800> of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
frequently because of the amount of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.860 
frequently because of the amount of
calories<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.460> have<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.600> amount<00:02:50.810> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
calories you have and the amount of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.510 
calories you have and the amount of
strain<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.290> going<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.470> put<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.709> your<00:02:51.830> CNS<00:02:52.310> as

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
strain it's going to put on your CNS as

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.480 
strain it's going to put on your CNS as
far<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.790> recovery<00:02:53.060> goes<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.620> mean<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.190> mean

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
far as recovery goes so I mean I mean

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.860 
far as recovery goes so I mean I mean
this<00:02:55.640> question<00:02:56.030> could<00:02:56.150> lead<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> lot<00:02:56.810> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this question could lead to a lot of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.810 
this question could lead to a lot of
different<00:02:57.320> things<00:02:57.500> as<00:02:58.160> far<00:02:58.400> as<00:02:58.490> what<00:02:58.670> your

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
different things as far as what your

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.580 
different things as far as what your
overall<00:02:59.180> goal<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.630> if<00:02:59.780> you're<00:02:59.930> bulking<00:03:00.170> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
overall goal is if you're bulking I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.130 
overall goal is if you're bulking I
think<00:03:01.130> more<00:03:01.310> frequency<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.090> off<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.540> optimal

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
think more frequency is off is optimal

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.470 
think more frequency is off is optimal
I'm<00:03:03.350> cutting<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.550> have<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.820> factor<00:03:05.240> in<00:03:05.270> how

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
I'm cutting you have to factor in how

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.630 
I'm cutting you have to factor in how
much<00:03:05.660> cardio<00:03:05.990> you're<00:03:06.350> doing<00:03:06.709> what<00:03:07.250> kind<00:03:07.550> of

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
much cardio you're doing what kind of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.160 
much cardio you're doing what kind of
car<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.970> you're<00:03:08.209> doing<00:03:08.480> as<00:03:08.600> far<00:03:08.780> as<00:03:08.990> high

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
car do you're doing as far as high

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.530 
car do you're doing as far as high
intensity<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.790> amount<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.120> glucose

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
intensity because the amount of glucose

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.000 
intensity because the amount of glucose
it's<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.990> use<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.380> amount<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.650> carbs

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it's going to use in the amount of carbs

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's going to use in the amount of carbs
that<00:03:13.220> has<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.520> be<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> lot<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:13.880> your<00:03:14.150> diet<00:03:14.360> to

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
that has to be a lot of your diet to

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.990 
that has to be a lot of your diet to
support<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.950> mean<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.580> can<00:03:16.850> really

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
support it so I mean this can really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.600 
support it so I mean this can really
stem<00:03:17.390> into<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> lot<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.440> different

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
stem into a lot of different

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.160 
stem into a lot of different
conversations<00:03:19.610> but<00:03:19.850> overall<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.990> say

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
conversations but overall I would say

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.340 
conversations but overall I would say
more<00:03:21.650> frequently<00:03:22.220> better<00:03:22.600> how<00:03:23.600> much<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.140> would

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
more frequently better how much I would

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.900 
more frequently better how much I would
say<00:03:24.500> two<00:03:24.560> times<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.190> week<00:03:25.220> would<00:03:25.400> be<00:03:25.640> great
