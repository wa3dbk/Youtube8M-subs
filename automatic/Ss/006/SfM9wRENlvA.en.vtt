might be cool well we got some new
images<00:01:54.079> showing<00:01:54.890> every<00:01:55.189> little<00:01:55.429> bit<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.640> this

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
images showing every little bit of this

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.850 
images showing every little bit of this
concepts<00:01:56.390> body<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:57.049> can<00:01:57.229> say<00:01:57.470> with<00:01:57.649> confidence

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
concepts body we can say with confidence

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.539 
concepts body we can say with confidence
I<00:01:58.399> would<00:01:59.149> tap<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.479> ass<00:02:00.100> look<00:02:01.100> at<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:01.280> thing

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
I would tap that ass look at this thing

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.429 
I would tap that ass look at this thing
notice<00:02:02.179> some<00:02:02.330> familiar<00:02:02.630> angles<00:02:02.929> to<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.170> car

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
notice some familiar angles to this car

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.669 
notice some familiar angles to this car
uh<00:02:03.679> maybe<00:02:04.130> Lotus<00:02:04.520> Evora<00:02:04.640> maybe<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.209> little<00:02:05.390> bit

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
uh maybe Lotus Evora maybe a little bit

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.650 
uh maybe Lotus Evora maybe a little bit
anyway<00:02:06.679> other<00:02:06.890> than<00:02:06.979> these<00:02:07.310> images<00:02:07.909> we<00:02:08.509> know

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
anyway other than these images we know

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.449 
anyway other than these images we know
the<00:02:08.780> concept<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.319> mid-engine<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.160> range

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the concept is mid-engine is a range

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580 
the concept is mid-engine is a range
extender<00:02:10.580> hybrid<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.540> will<00:02:11.720> debut<00:02:11.900> at<00:02:12.230> Geneva

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
extender hybrid and will debut at Geneva

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.160 
extender hybrid and will debut at Geneva
so<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> way<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.849> range<00:02:14.030> extender<00:02:14.480> works<00:02:14.900> is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
so the way the range extender works is

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
so the way the range extender works is
kind<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.650> fisker<00:02:16.069> karma<00:02:16.099> or<00:02:16.880> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
kind of like the fisker karma or the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000 
kind of like the fisker karma or the
gasoline<00:02:17.510> or<00:02:17.690> petrol<00:02:18.049> engine<00:02:18.349> recharges<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
gasoline or petrol engine recharges the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.009 
gasoline or petrol engine recharges the
batteries<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:19.910> power<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.420> electric<00:02:20.780> motor

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
batteries which power the electric motor

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.350 
batteries which power the electric motor
