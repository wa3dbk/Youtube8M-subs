hi this is Frank Hanigan with
Connecticut<00:00:04.020> gutter<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.380> exteriors<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.339> I'm

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
Connecticut gutter and exteriors and I'm

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.769 
Connecticut gutter and exteriors and I'm
here<00:00:05.580> today<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> talk<00:00:06.060> about<00:00:06.089> ice<00:00:06.359> damming

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
here today to talk about ice damming

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.839 
here today to talk about ice damming
explain<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.500> what<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.309> why<00:00:08.790> it

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
explain to you what it is why it

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.850 
explain to you what it is why it
happened<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> remedy

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
happened and what you can do to remedy

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.600 
happened and what you can do to remedy
ice<00:00:11.460> damming<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.980> metal<00:00:14.429> roof

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
ice damming so here we have a metal roof

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.599 
ice damming so here we have a metal roof
tomato<00:00:15.179> zinc<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.800> an<00:00:16.800> aluminum<00:00:17.250> rain<00:00:17.400> gutter

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
tomato zinc and an aluminum rain gutter

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.540 
tomato zinc and an aluminum rain gutter
below<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:19.170> paper<00:00:19.410> towel<00:00:19.710> roll<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.279> here

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
below and this paper towel roll is here

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.830 
below and this paper towel roll is here
to<00:00:20.939> illustrate<00:00:21.439> ice<00:00:22.439> dams<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.539> happens

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to illustrate ice dams so what happens

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.099 
to illustrate ice dams so what happens
is<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.260> winter<00:00:26.070> months<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.640> snowfall<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
is in winter months with snowfall the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
is in winter months with snowfall the
gutter<00:00:28.289> builds<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.890> snow<00:00:29.660> moisture<00:00:30.660> ice

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
gutter builds up with snow moisture ice

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.200 
gutter builds up with snow moisture ice
and<00:00:31.579> eventually<00:00:32.579> fills<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.829> everything

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
and eventually fills and everything

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.940 
and eventually fills and everything
cascading<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> roof<00:00:36.660> piles<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> top

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
cascading off the roof piles up on top

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.840 
cascading off the roof piles up on top
of<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.780> mound<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
of this and so you get a mound of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
of this and so you get a mound of
hardened<00:00:41.850> snow<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> ice<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.660> top<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
hardened snow and ice on top of the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.049 
hardened snow and ice on top of the
gutter

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
gutter

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.869 
gutter
the<00:00:45.059> reason<00:00:45.300> why<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.420> happens<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
the reason why this happens is and

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.430 
the reason why this happens is and
generally<00:00:47.879> we've<00:00:48.120> seen<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> massive

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
generally we've seen it in massive

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
generally we've seen it in massive
chunks<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> ice<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.309> could<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> clear<00:00:51.030> ice

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
chunks of ice this could be clear ice

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.459 
chunks of ice this could be clear ice
pure<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.410> no<00:00:52.739> snow<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.129> all<00:00:54.350> heat<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
pure water no snow at all heat is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.860 
pure water no snow at all heat is
escaping<00:00:55.620> inside<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> house<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.820> here's<00:00:57.750> your

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
escaping inside the house so here's your

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.080 
escaping inside the house so here's your
outside<00:00:58.230> wall<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> house<00:00:59.090> anything

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
outside wall of the house anything

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.260 
outside wall of the house anything
inside<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> beyond<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.949> vertical<00:01:02.489> wall<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
inside and beyond this vertical wall is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
inside and beyond this vertical wall is
being<00:01:03.539> heated<00:01:03.750> internally<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.939> heat

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
being heated internally all that heat

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630 
being heated internally all that heat
rises<00:01:06.390> inside<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> house<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> escapes<00:01:08.070> if

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
rises inside the house and escapes if

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
rises inside the house and escapes if
the<00:01:08.820> house<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.420> insulated<00:01:09.770> through

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the house is not well insulated through

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
the house is not well insulated through
the<00:01:10.979> roof<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> does<00:01:12.060> escape<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.630> heats<00:01:12.840> up

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the roof when it does escape it heats up

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.800 
the roof when it does escape it heats up
this<00:01:13.260> metal<00:01:13.890> surface<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> case<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this metal surface or in the case of a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
this metal surface or in the case of a
traditional<00:01:16.259> house<00:01:16.439> an<00:01:16.680> asphalt<00:01:17.100> shingle

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
traditional house an asphalt shingle

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.230 
traditional house an asphalt shingle
surface<00:01:18.560> just<00:01:19.560> warm<00:01:19.799> enough<00:01:19.890> where<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.939> snow

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
surface just warm enough where the snow

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.499 
surface just warm enough where the snow
melts<00:01:21.630> snow<00:01:22.350> melts<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> turns<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> water<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
melts snow melts it turns to water this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
melts snow melts it turns to water this
whole<00:01:24.810> area<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.439> heated<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.400> water<00:01:26.670> runs

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
whole area is now heated the water runs

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990 
whole area is now heated the water runs
south<00:01:27.299> down<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> roof<00:01:28.080> towards<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.000> chunk

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
south down the roof towards this chunk

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.460 
south down the roof towards this chunk
of<00:01:30.150> ice<00:01:31.460> lands<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> chunk<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.060> ice<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of ice lands on the chunk of ice and it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.620 
of ice lands on the chunk of ice and it
freezes<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.100> why<00:01:35.790> does<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> freeze<00:01:36.329> again

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
freezes again why does it freeze again

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
freezes again why does it freeze again
because<00:01:37.380> now<00:01:37.530> we're<00:01:37.710> beyond<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.400> house<00:01:38.610> wall

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because now we're beyond the house wall

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
because now we're beyond the house wall
where<00:01:39.299> everything<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> cold<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.610> an

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
where everything is cold so this is an

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
where everything is cold so this is an
ever-growing<00:01:42.329> chunk<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.049> ice<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.470> being

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
ever-growing chunk of ice that's being

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
ever-growing chunk of ice that's being
fed<00:01:44.100> by<00:01:44.280> melting<00:01:44.490> snow<00:01:44.970> off<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> roof<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
fed by melting snow off of the roof this

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.260 
fed by melting snow off of the roof this
just<00:01:46.920> continues<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> build<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.970> build<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
just continues to build and build and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.740 
just continues to build and build and
build<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.560> literally<00:01:49.979> amount<00:01:50.750> when

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
build and you have literally amount when

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
build and you have literally amount when
this<00:01:51.899> happens<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:54.000> gets<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.390> point

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this happens and it gets to this point

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.700 
this happens and it gets to this point
this<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.439> fairly<00:01:56.960> indicative<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.200> how<00:01:58.439> an<00:01:58.590> ice

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this is fairly indicative of how an ice

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.249 
this is fairly indicative of how an ice
dam<00:01:58.950> size-wise<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.180> look<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.780> five<00:02:01.049> inch

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
dam size-wise would look on a five inch

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.850 
dam size-wise would look on a five inch
gutter<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.689> snow<00:02:03.960> falls<00:02:04.229> alright

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
gutter you know more snow falls alright

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.160 
gutter you know more snow falls alright
so<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.280> another<00:02:05.549> snow<00:02:05.850> event<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:07.079> have

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
so we have another snow event you have

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
channels cut channels into this ice dam

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.140 
channels cut channels into this ice dam
we<00:03:55.519> want<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.819> create<00:03:56.030> grooves<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:57.019> go

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
we want to create grooves that go

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.240 
we want to create grooves that go
vertically<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.510> roofline<00:03:59.930> in<00:04:00.379> line<00:04:01.069> with

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
vertically up the roofline in line with

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.580 
vertically up the roofline in line with
say<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.639> standing<00:04:02.329> seen<00:04:02.540> here<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.230> if<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.379> cut

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
say this standing seen here so if I cut

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.770 
say this standing seen here so if I cut
a<00:04:03.620> groove<00:04:03.859> here<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.940> cut<00:04:05.150> a<00:04:05.180> groove<00:04:05.389> here

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
a groove here and I cut a groove here

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.960 
a groove here and I cut a groove here
and<00:04:06.139> I<00:04:06.379> cut<00:04:06.530> another<00:04:06.650> groove<00:04:07.010> here<00:04:07.370> what<00:04:07.849> I'm

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
and I cut another groove here what I'm

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.640 
and I cut another groove here what I'm
doing<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.419> creating<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.989> channel<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.560> allows

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
doing is creating a channel that allows

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.289 
doing is creating a channel that allows
this<00:04:10.010> water<00:04:10.310> that's<00:04:10.519> pulling<00:04:10.760> up<00:04:10.970> back<00:04:11.120> here

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
this water that's pulling up back here

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.900 
this water that's pulling up back here
to<00:04:11.480> escape<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.049> run<00:04:12.620> off<00:04:12.859> there's<00:04:13.760> other

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
to escape and run off there's other

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.319 
to escape and run off there's other
methodology<00:04:14.629> to<00:04:14.840> melt<00:04:15.799> instead<00:04:16.250> of<00:04:16.340> cut<00:04:16.609> the

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
methodology to melt instead of cut the

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.899
