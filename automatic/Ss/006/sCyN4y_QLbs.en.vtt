00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
 good your fears to a new video data 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.959
 and July 27 brito these hours you're a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.610
 lots and good it seems that we have a 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.380
 new gameplay of pharr create 4 you know 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 that is very very very little so that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 start the sony conference that 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.429
 will start as I say then in half an hour and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.839
 good basically because in this example 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.160
 of 7 minutes we can see something different 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.560
 of what we have seen the conference of 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 ubisoft that we've seen so well a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.009
 gameplay trailer that has not been playing 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.029
 to nothing here because it is total gameplay 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.320
 of the total game you already know that here the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 quite amazing pretty cool 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.940
 it looks pretty to 3 but with some 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.740
 changes basically that we are in another 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.490
 in another different location in the 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.620
 himalaya in kirat and well here you know 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.840
 we suffer the attack of a dictator 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 we could say and we must end 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 it something quite common already to the games of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 farc to meet with situations of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.810
 problems instantly arriving in the country 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 well here basically in this example 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.980
 well different things with respect to the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 previous for example in the crossbow the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 crossbow right now it's pretty 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.969
 different from the 3 here sacrifices 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.260
 a bit then the shooting quality by 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.180
 a little faster 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.760
 then we also have to be able to climb 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.380
 a kind of peak we could say to 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.080
 Same month of the word we launched 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.020
 and we are going to climb with a rope and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 then apart we can also we can 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 also then shoot we also enter 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.260
 by car I think we could also 3 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.340
 or I do not remember now very well I already 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.230
 so many games action moves the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.430
 things but good as the guy says 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.910
 it will not be easy to shoot while 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 we conduct was quite cabroncÃ­n of 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.700
 done in a part of the video is put at 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.160
 side a car and we can jump to the other 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.540
 car and kill the occupant will not be able 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.310
 do with all of that just because it 's 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.720
 the mission then part of it seemed 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.160
 that fell down a ravine and not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.390
 we could get out of the car and unfold a 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.350
 kind of strangers you know the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.270
 typical are you who wear the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.979
 paratroopers when they are thrown by 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.460
 ravines and such and then by deploying 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.260
 the parachute in animal management 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 elephants also how to capture a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.310
 small base like in the 3 that can be 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 capture different bases and then how 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 I say we have also seen an animal 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.990
 quite important the elephant that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 will have enough presence in this in 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.350
 this game remember that it was rumored that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750
 we can see the ride to see if 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.250
 can or not but since they are already indicates 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.140
 that surely yes 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.430
 ride then we have seen a little the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.530
 cooperative world seems to be 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.080
 can put in your game directly 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.430
 then as player mode change 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.340
 directly to what follows the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.770
 cooperative with the same map and such but 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.360
 with different missions so good 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.650
 nothing else I think he left me nothing else is 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.020
 important the example and you can see it 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.720
 the ones that I have to repeat and it's pretty 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.490
 cool I do not go then the news day 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.570
 will come out quite a few things apart from the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.530
 that the lectures have been shown 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.790
 remember that you can also do 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.220
 things are to start conferences 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.850
 logically and we recorded them in the next 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.850
 video until next time
