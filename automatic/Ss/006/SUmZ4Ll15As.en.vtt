it's<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.909> separate<00:01:15.240> move<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:16.110> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it's actually a separate move this is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
it's actually a separate move this is
great<00:01:16.409> combo<00:01:16.830> fodder<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.520> keep

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
great combo fodder that you can keep

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
great combo fodder that you can keep
people<00:01:17.850> locked<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> solid

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
people locked down with you solid

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.580 
people locked down with you solid
briefly<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> corner<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
briefly in the corner there so you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.899 
briefly in the corner there so you
actually<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> able<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> generate<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.640> ton<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
actually is able to generate a ton of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.010 
actually is able to generate a ton of
pressure<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> corner<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pressure in the corner but what it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.630 
pressure in the corner but what it
really<00:01:25.049> all<00:01:25.350> comes<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.460> course

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
really all comes down to is of course

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.580 
really all comes down to is of course
the<00:01:26.939> piledriver<00:01:27.330> that's<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.229> half<00:01:28.380> circle

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the piledriver that's just a half circle

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.929 
the piledriver that's just a half circle
away<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:32.040> can't<00:01:32.280> combo<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
away and you can you can't combo into it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
away and you can you can't combo into it
but<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.390> sorts<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.720> cool<00:01:33.869> setups

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
but you can get all sorts of cool setups

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.180 
but you can get all sorts of cool setups
for<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.799> including<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> air

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.080 

indeed<00:01:41.190> let's<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.820> supers<00:01:44.090> that's

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
indeed let's do some supers that's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.610 
indeed let's do some supers that's
pretty<00:01:45.300> massive<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.050> done<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> air<00:01:46.470> as

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
pretty massive can be done in the air as

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.070 
pretty massive can be done in the air as
well<00:01:47.120> generates<00:01:48.120> them<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.360> anywhere<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.600 

that's<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.229> grab<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:52.979> too<00:01:53.220> far<00:01:53.430> away

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that's the grab it's very too far away

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.359 
that's the grab it's very too far away
there<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:57.170> mighty<00:01:58.170> punish<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.220> going

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
there the mighty punish and that's going

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.460 
there the mighty punish and that's going
to<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.790> out<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.509> Thor<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> most
