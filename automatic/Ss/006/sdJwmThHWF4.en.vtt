00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 he would be dropping miss na great 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.970
 Now we have the jam 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello we together the film factory today 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 I have you cloudy with a chance 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 meatballs brought two and it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 is the story of the boy again 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.189
 inventor flint lockwood the meantime 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 was finally recognized and now too 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
 to meet his great role model chester 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 he is the boss and the boss of the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.000
 live court company and they are just for 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.610
 responsible and are great inventions 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 as well as the gigantomania in modern times 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 industry and there was just that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.800
 he can work for that though 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.140
 a bit sneaky for them 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.480
 were actually only the invention 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.030
 namely have the flitting heads 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.579
 he stands alone on an island 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 has been left with just this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
 machine that everything can happen there 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.649
 I have now until the first part 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 Do not betray too much but there are 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.309
 suddenly from the food also animals 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.800
 created so chimpanzees and 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.539
 something similar and just take care 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280
 that the animals are not the island 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.879
 leave and world domination in itself 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 tear 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.540
 so a bit exaggerated now though 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.189
 the story is as big as the whole 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 Looks that you should see us here 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.439
 hurry before we even more such 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.439
 creatures encounter 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.130
 it's so beautiful 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.200
 an adult's tears easily though 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.570
 You do not do this one again 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.070
 come in tears 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.659
 I really liked the first part 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.399
 I really did not like it now 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.200
 masterpiece so the first part of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.880
 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 but who is so typical for me now 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.630
 couch class you can be good at home 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 somehow hang on the couch and she 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.580
 So watch a movie like her 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 Now every Sunday imagine was the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.519
 first part for me and something similar 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.319
 I also hoped for the second 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.299
 nice good entertainment with nice 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.750
 creative ideas because you have to 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.750
 already say how the whole meal or 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.459
 so there was an idea for it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 behind and which animals like 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.110
 be that there as well as his one 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.940
 Huge takko monster gives or how 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.250
 small dragonflies but actually too 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 something else and buttercups 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.459
 There are many funny ones 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 marshmallows that jump around so completely 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.269
 many great ideas 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.370
 I always like it when you like it 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 something out of reality in this 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.450
 fictional colorful brings in and that 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.970
 creates a new world creates it 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.590
 the film also work here unfortunately 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.660
 other things do not happen at all 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.519
 the story is not like that at all 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.380
 really felt you know not that 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.230
 Evers you have everything right now 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.720
 for problems I can already see that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.600
 villain or this live korda should 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.430
 already a lot of criticism in the current 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.829
 industry has also brought 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.500
 Almost the impression that never happened 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.930
 a real pictures steve jobs and the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.900
 want to give apple 1 at that time too 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.069
 so the godlike techie was the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.440
 then just as it already is 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.239
 got to know with foxconn and co in 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.489
 asia on balance go do it 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.170
 Everything will be here, too 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.690
 embedded but it does not work 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 it will not and as a common 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.980
 working round masters are everything 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.630
 so small individual fragments and it is 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.579
 just for a talked about movie 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.340
 also very suitable for children his to 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.569
 just not the best condition 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.760
 when i tan my animated film 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.170
 I look forward to seeing in 3d too 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.450
 I actually can become more commonplace 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.799
 I slip in a lot deeper 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.900
 the story that's honest 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.090
 a bottomless insolence 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.239
 i have no bad in this year 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.170
 3d transforms movie seen there happened 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.450
 nothing at all 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.560
 So you get an expensive sunglasses 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.120
 also, so to speak 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.420
 but nothing happens 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.860
 would justify a cents surcharge 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.380
 if I look at it like nemo 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.270
 after ten years he came in 2003 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
 into the cinema again this year in 3d 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.260
 what was there all in all 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.209
 directions in the cinema 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.739
 It's really a shamelessness so that 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.389
 you should save yourself in any case 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.100
 but the thing is that the movie too 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.900
 not only in 3d can be good at something like that 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.639
 is because the film in and for itself and there 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.620
 All the colorful figures have to be here 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.510
 to be spoken by anyone 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.130
 they can not do that by themselves and 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.350
 that put the synchro at the most 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.500
 relatively good for me but also watches 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.800
 cancer was the assistant 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.729
 the assistant monkey from the jazz tabat 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.169
 spoken of this yes you know 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.570
 small tip the monkey is a bit 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.200
 thicker and in pink and has two small ones 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.850
 pigtails 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.210
 There you did not let it take you 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.889
 cindy from marzahn to let them speak 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.710
 and you can talk about the humor now 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.660
 say what you want me personally 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.520
 me no map from the solo program of 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.560
 Buy cindy from marzahn but plays 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.380
 no role if the good a spokesman 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.580
 education would have been optional 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.919
 It would have been enough if you were with her 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.140
 a weekend seminar in dubbing 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.910
 that would have been made obvious 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.669
 not done or the woman is in things 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.610
 synchronous talent-free it is one 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.229
 disaster all sounds like in 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.840
 a cast and then comes the monkey 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.660
 again and I have the feeling I read 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.710
 everything that I say somehow off and on 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.229
 then with a forced 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.120
 Berlin imperious accent which in this 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.070
 world of fantasy nothing at all 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.780
 I always look forward to looking 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.280
 this but again kicked out of the picture 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.979
 Unfortunately it was too often 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.940
 It also means there makes the movie 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.130
 some wrong 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.200
 overall he is nice animated I like 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.210
 also the creative ideas that are enough 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.800
 but not completely 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.510
 convincing and that's why I'm on 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.340
 Some are more bored than 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.650
 I felt entertained and that's why 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.460
 it is just a rather 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.300
 below-average film who should 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.710
 Proceed with a view to 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.810
 meatballs though now in the cinema 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.220
 People are watching the first part 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.169
 extremely good 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.510
 and endure that the second less 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.700
 well still find worth seeing 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.550
 general animation fans for the 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.710
 are very much 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.380
 well animated so what I see too 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.280
 gamer because it's just the light weight 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.480
 gaming style of this comic if you 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.960
 you look at the pictures you know what 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.790
 I mean 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.290
 Who should I not watch the movie? 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.000
 but are people who say i like it already 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.040
 I have a round story that saw me 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.150
 pick up somehow and then pick up 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.130
 not somehow alone again in the 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.600
 leave behind cinema , so you want 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.610
 already a connection to places too 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.830
 if there are little colorful figures and 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.810
 even small monkeys speak here 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.070
 if you can do that anyway 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.660
 to the needs I should you the film 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.370
 do not look and people say 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.530
 ey when I look at my animation team 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.520
 please in 3d and it should also be cool 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.440
 this is a bottomless one 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 That does not save you insolence 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.260
 only the three euros 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.570
 3d serve but the complete 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.650
 Enter my personal review of 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.680
 Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.310
 Part 2 are disappointed though from 10 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.800
 points 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.170
 creativity remains with the film 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.820
 the animation is also nice and diagonal 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.680
 unlike me those from others 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.000
 I am used to animation films 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.950
 but that's not enough 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.780
 ignore that the 3d effects are not 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.910
 The story is easy to work 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.830
 not round and just a few 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.960
 dubbing your work not 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.940
 especially good because of that 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.010
 it is just slightly below average 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.910
 and only for fans worth four of 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.620
 ten points 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.480
 that was my rule too cloudy with 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.650
 view on meatballs two of 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.300
 I would now know two things to you 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.830
 we have to get a bit creative 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.050
 what is your favorite food what is yours 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.880
 favorite animal and where is that one too 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.250
 a title together that's the quasi too
