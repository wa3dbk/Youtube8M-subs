00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the reason for this sudden change is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.130 
the reason for this sudden change is
that<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.670> kind<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.120> felt<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.900> doing

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
that I kind of just felt like doing

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.340 
that I kind of just felt like doing
something<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:10.739> hair<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.080> kind<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.140> want

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
something to my hair and I kind of want

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.080 
something to my hair and I kind of want
like<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.070> silvery<00:03:15.080> why<00:03:16.080> it<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.519> gray<00:03:17.519> back

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
like the silvery why it is gray back

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.170 
like the silvery why it is gray back
that<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.420> had<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:19.049> while<00:03:19.380> back<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.220> mean<00:03:20.370> when

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that I had a while back and I mean when

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.840 
that I had a while back and I mean when
this<00:03:21.330> fades<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.350> pretty<00:03:22.920> much<00:03:23.040> go<00:03:23.489> into

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
this fades it will pretty much go into

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
this fades it will pretty much go into
some<00:03:24.000> kind<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.299> greyish<00:03:24.780> color<00:03:25.170> anyway<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.220> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
some kind of greyish color anyway so I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
some kind of greyish color anyway so I
thought<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.489> might<00:03:26.610> as<00:03:26.820> well<00:03:26.910> try<00:03:27.360> some<00:03:27.600> blow

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
it all on my head and the first time

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.800 
it all on my head and the first time
pretty<00:04:14.340> much<00:04:14.430> nothing<00:04:14.909> happened<00:04:15.360> just<00:04:15.629> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
pretty much nothing happened just the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.259 
pretty much nothing happened just the
lengths<00:04:16.139> got<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> little<00:04:16.859> bit<00:04:16.949> lie<00:04:17.220> lucky<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.239> I

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
lengths got a little bit lie lucky so I

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.000 
lengths got a little bit lie lucky so I
used<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.959> second<00:04:19.650> are<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.720> dye<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:22.260> this

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
used a second are of dye and this

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.390 
used a second are of dye and this
happens<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:24.090> took<00:04:24.270> two<00:04:24.510> times<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.220> don't

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
happens so it took two times and I don't

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.400 
happens so it took two times and I don't
know<00:04:26.520> how<00:04:26.669> long<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.000> lifted<00:04:27.210> in<00:04:27.300> for<00:04:27.570> maybe<00:04:28.260> a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
know how long it lifted in for maybe a

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.580 
know how long it lifted in for maybe a
total<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.580> while<00:04:30.389> that's<00:04:30.870> pretty<00:04:31.290> much<00:04:31.410> all

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
total of a while that's pretty much all

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.070 
total of a while that's pretty much all
I<00:04:31.650> have<00:04:32.010> for<00:04:32.310> today's<00:04:32.669> video

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
word is built up with the word hair and

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.570 
word is built up with the word hair and
the<00:04:47.310> word<00:04:47.490> color<00:04:47.910> which<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.870> whole<00:04:49.199> water<00:04:49.580> fat
