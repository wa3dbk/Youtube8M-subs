00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
didn't enjoy raging blast 2 it's because

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.810 
didn't enjoy raging blast 2 it's because
the<00:02:54.810> they<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> story<00:02:56.310> mode<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.700> I

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.699 
something I've been thinking about I
just<00:03:41.459> want<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.150> some<00:03:43.079> Dragon<00:03:43.500> Balls

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
just want to see some Dragon Balls

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.650 
just want to see some Dragon Balls
obvious<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.610> not<00:03:44.820> Dragon<00:03:45.180> Ball<00:03:45.299> Z<00:03:45.329> but

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
obvious you know not Dragon Ball Z but

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.020 
obvious you know not Dragon Ball Z but
just<00:03:45.930> straight<00:03:46.170> Dragon<00:03:46.650> Ball<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:47.100> think<00:03:47.880> that'd

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
just straight Dragon Ball I think that'd

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.150 
just straight Dragon Ball I think that'd
be<00:03:48.150> fun<00:03:48.390> too<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.989> know<00:03:49.019> their<00:03:49.350> limit<00:03:50.040> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
be fun too but you know their limit is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.770 
be fun too but you know their limit is
not<00:03:50.280> memory<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.850> you<00:03:50.970> know<00:03:51.090> they<00:03:51.209> can't<00:03:51.600> put

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
not memory so you know they can't put

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.780 
not memory so you know they can't put
everything<00:03:52.109> into<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.530> game<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.370> don't

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
everything into the game and I don't

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.039 
everything into the game and I don't
expect<00:03:54.060> them<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.359> but<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.840> some

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
expect them to but that's just some

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.830 
expect them to but that's just some
ideas<00:03:55.140> I<00:03:55.560> had<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.579> also<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.420> was<00:03:57.570> talking

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
ideas I had and also they was talking

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.800 
ideas I had and also they was talking
about<00:03:57.900> keeping<00:03:58.470> Hero<00:03:59.070> Mode<00:03:59.400> and<00:03:59.700> he<00:04:00.540> remote

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
about keeping Hero Mode and he remote

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.900 
about keeping Hero Mode and he remote
was<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.890> said<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.130> was<00:04:02.220> different<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
was like I said it was different so it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.940 
was like I said it was different so it
was<00:04:03.000> fun<00:04:03.150> at<00:04:03.269> first<00:04:03.329> but<00:04:03.750> at<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> same<00:04:04.470> time<00:04:04.680> it

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
was fun at first but at the same time it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.130 
was fun at first but at the same time it
was<00:04:04.980> kind<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.459> because<00:04:06.390> all<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.930> did<00:04:07.109> was

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
was kind of a because all you did was

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.949 
was kind of a because all you did was
fight<00:04:07.829> somebody<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:09.000> then<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.570> person<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
fight somebody and then the person you

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.660 
fight somebody and then the person you
thought<00:04:10.109> became<00:04:10.440> with<00:04:10.590> training<00:04:10.859> then<00:04:11.549> you

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
thought became with training then you

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.949 
thought became with training then you
fight<00:04:11.850> somebody<00:04:12.090> else<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.600> person<00:04:12.870> who

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
fight somebody else in a person who

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.780
