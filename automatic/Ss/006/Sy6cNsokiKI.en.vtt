today's review this is based off
invidious<00:05:09.229> reference<00:05:09.860> base<00:05:10.070> design<00:05:10.490> it's

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
invidious reference base design it's

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.520 
invidious reference base design it's
basically<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.120> suggestion<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.870> companies<00:05:12.320> on
