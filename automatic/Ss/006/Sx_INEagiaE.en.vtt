00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

hey<00:00:00.120> folks<00:00:00.420> we're<00:00:01.319> building<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.770> chicken

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hey folks we're building a chicken

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.519 
hey folks we're building a chicken
tractor<00:00:02.429> here<00:00:02.909> today<00:00:03.830> at<00:00:04.830> my<00:00:05.220> wife's<00:00:05.490> request

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
tractor here today at my wife's request

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.530 
tractor here today at my wife's request
it's<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.740> very<00:00:07.980> complicated<00:00:08.670> but<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.179> idea

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
it's not very complicated but the idea

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
it's not very complicated but the idea
with<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.719> chicken<00:00:10.050> tractor<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
with the chicken tractor is that it's a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580 
with the chicken tractor is that it's a
small<00:00:11.580> enough<00:00:11.820> chicken<00:00:12.269> coop<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:13.440> can

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
small enough chicken coop and you can

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
small enough chicken coop and you can
move<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.980> around<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:15.210> yard<00:00:20.060> basically<00:00:21.060> what

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
move it around the yard basically what

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
move it around the yard basically what
you're<00:00:21.390> looking<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> I've<00:00:22.289> built<00:00:22.650> this

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you're looking at is I've built this

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.679 
you're looking at is I've built this
basic<00:00:23.400> frame<00:00:23.699> structure<00:00:26.390> we<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.510> play

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
basic frame structure we can play

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.500 
basic frame structure we can play
baseball<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.320> bit<00:00:28.529> later<00:00:28.769> okay<00:00:29.510> I'm

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
baseball a little bit later okay I'm

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.030 
baseball a little bit later okay I'm
recording<00:00:33.170> okay<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.290> talking<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
recording okay I'm talking about the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.170 
recording okay I'm talking about the
chicken<00:00:35.399> tractor<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:37.430> made<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.969> by

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
chicken tractor I made it out of two by

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
chicken tractor I made it out of two by
threes<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:42.020> hardest<00:00:43.020> part<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.379> me<00:00:43.530> was

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
threes and the hardest part for me was

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.340 
threes and the hardest part for me was
cutting<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.059> angles<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> triangle

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
cutting the the angles for the triangle

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
cutting the the angles for the triangle
because<00:00:46.680> those<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.129> sixty<00:00:47.520> degree

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
because those would be sixty degree

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
because those would be sixty degree
angles<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.719> where<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.440> meet<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
angles here at where they meet at the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.819 
angles here at where they meet at the
base<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.629> 30<00:00:51.629> degree<00:00:51.989> angles<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.590> they

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
base and 30 degree angles where they

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.680 
base and 30 degree angles where they
meet<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> top<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
meet here at the top and I don't have a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
meet here at the top and I don't have a
miter<00:00:57.989> box<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> table<00:00:59.430> saw<00:00:59.760> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
miter box I don't have a table saw so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.910 
miter box I don't have a table saw so
coming<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.570> those<00:01:00.870> angles<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
coming up with those angles with a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.609 
coming up with those angles with a
little<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.370> tricky<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.899> wife<00:01:04.110> figured<00:01:04.500> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
little bit tricky so my wife figured it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit tricky so my wife figured it
out<00:01:04.739> she<00:01:05.189> made<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> card<00:01:06.150> paper<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
out she made this on card paper here the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.000 
out she made this on card paper here the
angles<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> need<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.710> trace<00:01:10.979> my

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
angles that I need and so I can trace my

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.210 
angles that I need and so I can trace my
cuts<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.560> cut<00:01:14.010> them

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
cuts with this and then I just cut them

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.590 
cuts with this and then I just cut them
with<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.560> circular<00:01:16.560> saw<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.299> works

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
with the circular saw there and it works

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.710 
with the circular saw there and it works
pretty<00:01:18.840> good<00:01:18.960> after<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.720> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
pretty good after all it's just a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.010 
pretty good after all it's just a
chicken<00:01:21.960> coop<00:01:22.759> alright<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.570> we're<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
chicken coop alright so we're going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
chicken coop alright so we're going to
work<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> next<00:01:25.710> stages<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:26.580> we'll

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
work on the next stages and then we'll

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.960 
work on the next stages and then we'll
check<00:01:27.150> back<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> later<00:01:30.979> this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> stage<00:01:32.430> 2<00:01:32.790> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
check back in later this is stage 2 of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.289 
check back in later this is stage 2 of
the<00:01:33.030> chicken<00:01:33.420> tractor<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.000> added

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the chicken tractor you can see we added

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.100 
the chicken tractor you can see we added
that<00:01:36.450> loft<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.909> also<00:01:42.090> put<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.780> this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
that loft there and we also put in this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.300 
that loft there and we also put in this
roof<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.460> bar<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.030> runs<00:01:45.270> through<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
roof to this bar that runs through the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.359 
roof to this bar that runs through the
main<00:01:47.310> section<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:49.710> did<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.159> adding

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
main section there we did it by adding

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.450 
main section there we did it by adding
these<00:01:52.610> these<00:01:53.610> supports<00:01:54.200> three<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.560> again

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
these these supports three of them again

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.330 
these these supports three of them again
cutting<00:01:56.790> those<00:01:57.030> sixty<00:01:57.570> degree<00:01:57.930> angles<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
cutting those sixty degree angles it

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.060 
cutting those sixty degree angles it
wasn't<00:01:59.729> too<00:01:59.880> complicated

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.880 

and<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:04.450> we're<00:02:04.660> going<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.960> start<00:02:05.470> putting<00:02:05.770> on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and now we're going to start putting on

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.219 
and now we're going to start putting on
the<00:02:05.920> finishing<00:02:06.190> finishing<00:02:07.060> touches<00:02:07.600> putting

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the finishing finishing touches putting

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.150 
the finishing finishing touches putting
the<00:02:08.320> chicken<00:02:08.680> wire<00:02:08.860> around<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.790> pan<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:11.160> some

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
the chicken wire around the pan and some

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.910 
the chicken wire around the pan and some
walls<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.700> doors<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.360> right<00:02:13.540> spots<00:02:13.930> so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
walls and doors in the right spots so

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.180 
walls and doors in the right spots so
let's<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.430> work<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:17.190> we'll

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
let's get to work on that now and we'll

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.090 
let's get to work on that now and we'll
come<00:02:18.340> back<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> show<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.150> little<00:02:19.450> bit

come back and show you that little bit

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.470 
come back and show you that little bit
here's<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.220> chicken<00:02:21.430> tractor<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.030> about

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
here's the chicken tractor just about

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.280 
here's the chicken tractor just about
nearly<00:02:22.810> done<00:02:24.120> see<00:02:25.120> I've<00:02:25.210> covered<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.750> pan

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
nearly done see I've covered the pan

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.130 
nearly done see I've covered the pan
area<00:02:26.680> with<00:02:26.890> chicken<00:02:27.310> wire<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:29.710> three<00:02:30.040> sides

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
area with chicken wire on three sides

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:40.680 
area with chicken wire on three sides
still<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.350> door<00:02:32.910> right<00:02:33.910> down<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:39.690> with

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
still this door right down here I with

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.480 
still this door right down here I with
the<00:02:40.840> exception<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> two<00:02:41.680> by<00:02:41.920> threes<00:02:42.280> I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the exception of the two by threes I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.920 
the exception of the two by threes I
made<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.910> entirely<00:02:43.390> of<00:02:44.640> scrap<00:02:45.640> lumber<00:02:45.930> some

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
made this entirely of scrap lumber some

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.160 
made this entirely of scrap lumber some
of<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.290> trash<00:02:47.650> pick<00:02:48.010> another<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.670> picked<00:02:48.940> up

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
of it a trash pick another we picked up

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.390 
of it a trash pick another we picked up
they<00:02:50.170> were<00:02:50.290> giving<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.710> away<00:02:50.830> at<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.340> yard<00:02:51.730> sale

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
they were giving it away at a yard sale

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.000 
they were giving it away at a yard sale
so<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.430> covered<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:56.430> nesting<00:02:57.430> area<00:02:57.580> with<00:02:58.420> would

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so I covered the nesting area with would

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.800 
so I covered the nesting area with would
overlap<00:03:00.010> those<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:00.730> side<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.450> water

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
overlap those on that side to this water

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.850 
overlap those on that side to this water
proof<00:03:03.120> over<00:03:04.120> on<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.630> side<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:05.050> have<00:03:05.230> sections

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
proof over on this side we have sections

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.930 
proof over on this side we have sections
that<00:03:05.950> open<00:03:06.430> up<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.970> can<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.510> hinges<00:03:08.940> this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
that open up you can see the hinges this

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.620 
that open up you can see the hinges this
opens<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:11.140> give<00:03:11.380> access<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:13.590> lower<00:03:14.590> area<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
opens to give access to the lower area I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.390 
opens to give access to the lower area I
still<00:03:16.630> need<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:17.080> another<00:03:17.380> set<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.920> hinges

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
still need to get another set of hinges

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.259 
still need to get another set of hinges
for<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.360> section<00:03:20.200> here<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:21.340> that'll<00:03:21.730> flip

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
for this section here but that'll flip

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.250 
for this section here but that'll flip
down<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.780> give<00:03:22.930> access<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.860> upper

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
down and give access to the upper

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.520 
down and give access to the upper
nesting<00:03:26.260> area<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.780> set<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.140> get<00:03:29.320> those

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
nesting area so set up to get those

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.280 
nesting area so set up to get those
hinges<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.190> beyond<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.810> only<00:03:32.110> other

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
hinges and beyond that the only other

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.620 
hinges and beyond that the only other
thing<00:03:32.620> left<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.580> put<00:03:33.610> some<00:03:34.000> wheels<00:03:34.239> on<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
thing left is to put some wheels on the

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.150 
thing left is to put some wheels on the
bottom<00:03:35.500> here

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
bottom here

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.040 
bottom here
maybe<00:03:36.850> I'll<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.209> them<00:03:37.360> off<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.540> an<00:03:37.930> old

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
maybe I'll get them off of an old

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.979 
maybe I'll get them off of an old
lawnmower<00:03:38.410> or<00:03:38.769> something<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.600> make<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.810> a

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
lawnmower or something just to make it a

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.470 
lawnmower or something just to make it a
little<00:03:41.170> bit<00:03:41.380> easier<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:42.000> move<00:03:43.000> around<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
little bit easier to move around the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.140 
little bit easier to move around the
yard

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.860 

and<00:03:48.659> so<00:03:48.900> there<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.349> it<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.709> few<00:03:50.870> hours

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
and so there you have it a few hours

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.640 
and so there you have it a few hours
time<00:03:52.610> some<00:03:53.610> expenses<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.780> two<00:03:55.049> by<00:03:55.260> threes

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
time some expenses for the two by threes

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.509 
time some expenses for the two by threes
and<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.069> hardware<00:03:56.580> hinges<00:03:57.530> screws<00:03:58.530> staples

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
and the hardware hinges screws staples

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.530 
and the hardware hinges screws staples
chicken<00:04:00.420> wire<00:04:01.640> but<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.760> rest<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.209> lumber

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
chicken wire but the rest of the lumber

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.190 
chicken wire but the rest of the lumber
was<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.780> scrap<00:04:04.409> or<00:04:04.819> donated<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.690> cost<00:04:06.959> is

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
was a scrap or donated so the cost is

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.850 
was a scrap or donated so the cost is
minimal

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
minimal

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.610 
minimal
and<00:04:09.079> this<00:04:10.079> should<00:04:10.400> service<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.500> don't<00:04:13.500> know

and this should service for I don't know
a<00:04:13.860> handful<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.459> years<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.320> could<00:04:16.440> make

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
a handful of years and you could make

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.650 
a handful of years and you could make
one<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.100> own<00:04:17.160> also<00:04:18.109> thanks<00:04:19.109> for<00:04:19.260> watching
