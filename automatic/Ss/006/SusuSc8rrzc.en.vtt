did<00:04:40.000> take<00:04:40.270> me<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> little<00:04:40.690> while<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.550> got

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
did take me a little while I got

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
interrupted from time to time but it's a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.150 
interrupted from time to time but it's a
project<00:04:46.720> that's<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.990> little<00:04:47.230> more<00:04:47.910> complicated

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
project that's a little more complicated

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.590 
project that's a little more complicated
mostly<00:04:51.160> because<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.700> did<00:04:51.940> not<00:04:51.970> come<00:04:52.419> with<00:04:52.570> any

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
mostly because it did not come with any

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.950 
mostly because it did not come with any
instructions<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:54.520> had<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.940> pretty<00:04:55.810> much

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
instructions and you had to pretty much

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.520 
instructions and you had to pretty much
figure<00:04:56.350> it<00:04:56.410> out<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.690> good<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.260> do<00:04:59.410> it

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
figure it out but it's a good to do it

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
feelings about the lower fairings but I

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.040 
feelings about the lower fairings but I
got<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.660> good<00:05:07.930> price<00:05:08.260> there<00:05:08.680> was<00:05:08.800> 77<00:05:09.370> dollars

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
got a good price there was 77 dollars

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.680 
got a good price there was 77 dollars
for<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.169> fairing<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.850> think<00:05:13.120> fifty-five

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
for the fairing and I think fifty-five

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.280 
for the fairing and I think fifty-five
dollars<00:05:13.930> for<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.380> attachment<00:05:14.680> hardware<00:05:16.290> from

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
dollars for the attachment hardware from

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.560 
dollars for the attachment hardware from
the<00:05:17.440> factory<00:05:17.950> they're<00:05:18.240> probably<00:05:19.240> about<00:05:19.330> three

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
the factory they're probably about three

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.870 
the factory they're probably about three
hundred<00:05:19.840> dollars<00:05:20.140> apiece<00:05:20.500> but<00:05:21.400> this<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.850> a

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
hundred dollars apiece but this is a

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.710 
hundred dollars apiece but this is a
looks<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:22.990> be<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.140> cheaper<00:05:23.620> plastic<00:05:24.360> but<00:05:25.360> it

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
looks to be a cheaper plastic but it

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.159 
looks to be a cheaper plastic but it
should<00:05:26.610> do<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.640> job<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:28.330> prevent<00:05:28.780> some<00:05:29.050> of

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
should do the job and prevent some of

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.219 
should do the job and prevent some of
the<00:05:29.669> water<00:05:30.669> and<00:05:31.060> stuff<00:05:31.690> like<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:32.050> from

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
the water and stuff like that from

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
splashing up on me and as you can see

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.050 
splashing up on me and as you can see
it's<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.729> vented<00:05:37.479> fairing<00:05:38.160> so<00:05:39.160> those<00:05:39.340> open<00:05:39.820> and

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
it's a vented fairing so those open and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.909
