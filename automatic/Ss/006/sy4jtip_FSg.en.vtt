 it is a moment of time to summarize to make a general picture 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.550

 I sing here, however, some logged 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.419

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.789

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.740
 mini dvd 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.050

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.490
 to manage to 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.279

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.349
 the fleeting moment 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.349
