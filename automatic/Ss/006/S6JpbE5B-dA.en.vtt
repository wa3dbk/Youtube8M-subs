00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
intrigued and part of me I really just

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
intrigued and part of me I really just
wanted<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> enjoy<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.829> seems<00:00:44.070> like

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
sure and I reached a point in the book
where<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.800> felt<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.610> solving<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
where I felt like I was solving a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
where I felt like I was solving a
mystery<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.590> no<00:00:55.860> mystery<00:00:56.340> and

mystery but there was no mystery and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.470 
mystery but there was no mystery and
that<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.370> pushed<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.520> forward<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.329> then

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
that kind of pushed me forward and then
I<00:01:00.510> realized<00:01:00.899> they're<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.350> sort<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
another woman and it's kind of all about

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700 
another woman and it's kind of all about
how<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> three<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:25.619> know

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
how the three of them are you know

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
how the three of them are you know
anyway<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:26.909> about<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.439> said

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
anyway it's just about them like I said

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
anyway it's just about them like I said
I<00:01:28.650> wasn't<00:01:29.100> totally<00:01:29.220> into<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I wasn't totally into this in the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.020 
I wasn't totally into this in the
beginning<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.380> guess<00:01:31.650> from<00:01:32.340> from<00:01:32.909> my

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
beginning so I guess from from my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
beginning so I guess from from my
perspective<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> slow<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.030> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
perspective it's kind of slow but I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.130 
perspective it's kind of slow but I
really<00:01:36.930> enjoyed<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.860> ending<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.049> kind<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
really enjoyed the ending and kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
really enjoyed the ending and kind of
climax<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.950> book<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:42.570> has

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
climax of the book and this has

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
climax of the book and this has
definitely<00:01:43.320> got<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> magical

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
definitely got a little bit of magical

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
definitely got a little bit of magical
realism<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.140> point<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
realism in it and at that point in the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
the bat that I loved it I really really

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.320 
the bat that I loved it I really really
did<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.190> had<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.370> lot<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.550> feelings<00:03:00.820> about<00:03:01.120> it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
did and I had a lot of feelings about it

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.000 
did and I had a lot of feelings about it
and<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.750> lot<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.930> emotions<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.800> there<00:03:02.920> are

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
and a lot of emotions and there are

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.190 
and a lot of emotions and there are
reasons<00:03:03.239> but<00:03:04.239> when<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.570> sat<00:03:04.810> down<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.989> talk

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
reasons but when I sat down to talk

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.509 
reasons but when I sat down to talk
about<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.739> found<00:03:05.890> myself<00:03:06.070> completely

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
about it I found myself completely

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.470 
about it I found myself completely
tongue-tied<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.510> think<00:03:07.989> that's<00:03:08.140> because<00:03:08.370> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
tongue-tied I think that's because the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.910 
tongue-tied I think that's because the
experience<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.600> reading<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> book<00:03:11.200> was

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
really kind of an intense one and in the

really kind of an intense one and in the
end<00:03:16.239> when<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.660> came<00:03:16.780> out<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.440> just<00:03:17.650> didn't

because<00:04:44.850> I'm<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.720> type<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.930> person<00:04:46.380> who<00:04:46.590> I've

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
because I'm the type of person who I've

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.370 
because I'm the type of person who I've
been<00:04:47.340> extremely<00:04:47.550> depressed<00:04:48.150> but<00:04:48.480> I've<00:04:48.960> never

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
been suicidal and it's hard for me to

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.450 
been suicidal and it's hard for me to
grasp<00:04:51.540> why<00:04:52.380> someone<00:04:52.740> would<00:04:52.890> feel<00:04:53.070> that<00:04:53.310> way

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
grasp why someone would feel that way

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.270 
grasp why someone would feel that way
but<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:54.180> definitely<00:04:54.660> get<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.200> sense<00:04:55.380> in<00:04:55.860> here

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
but you definitely get the sense in here

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.090 
but you definitely get the sense in here
of<00:04:56.510> why<00:04:57.510> someone<00:04:58.110> might<00:04:58.230> feel<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.500> way<00:04:58.710> or

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
of why someone might feel that way or

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.200 
of why someone might feel that way or
how<00:04:59.780> out<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.840> control<00:05:01.440> they<00:05:01.650> are<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:02.250> their<00:05:03.150> own

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
how out of control they are of their own

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.340 
how out of control they are of their own
emotion<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.560> know<00:05:04.680> everything<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.390> know

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.460

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.890 
kind of seamlessly you go through her
life<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.940> know<00:05:23.970> at<00:05:24.180> first<00:05:24.210> it's<00:05:24.600> just<00:05:24.630> her

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
life you know at first it's just her

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.080 
life you know at first it's just her
day-to-day<00:05:25.380> life<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:26.010> then<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.850> kind<00:05:27.030> of

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
day-to-day life and then it kind of

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.730 
day-to-day life and then it kind of
spreads<00:05:27.540> out<00:05:27.780> if<00:05:28.080> she<00:05:28.229> becomes<00:05:28.440> more

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
spreads out if she becomes more

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.060 
spreads out if she becomes more
depressed<00:05:29.160> and<00:05:29.400> more<00:05:29.490> suicidal<00:05:30.169> until<00:05:31.169> it's

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
depressed and more suicidal until it's

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.690 
depressed and more suicidal until it's
almost<00:05:32.580> like<00:05:33.410> you're<00:05:34.410> seeing<00:05:34.650> snippets<00:05:35.370> and

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
almost like you're seeing snippets and

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.120 
almost like you're seeing snippets and
maybe<00:05:36.479> maybe<00:05:37.110> that's<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.500> way<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.860> she's

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
maybe maybe that's the way that she's

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.040 
maybe maybe that's the way that she's
seeing<00:05:38.430> her<00:05:38.610> life<00:05:38.790> but<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.210> felt<00:05:39.540> like<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.900> was
