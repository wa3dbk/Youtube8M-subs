00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
season one with this rise of the snakes

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.090 
season one with this rise of the snakes
they<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.799> together<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.280> iTunes<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
they put it all together with iTunes on

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
they put it all together with iTunes on
yeah<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.130> iTunes<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.060> put<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.600> there

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
yeah on iTunes so they put them in there

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
yeah on iTunes so they put them in there
so<00:01:19.140> they<00:01:19.259> have<00:01:19.350> um<00:01:19.650> 15<00:01:20.369> episodes<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.119> season<00:01:21.150> 1

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so they have um 15 episodes for season 1

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.280 
so they have um 15 episodes for season 1
so<00:01:22.259> technically<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.610> skeleton<00:01:24.299> episodes<00:01:24.960> are

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
so technically the skeleton episodes are

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.999 
so technically the skeleton episodes are
not<00:01:26.040> season<00:01:26.610> 1<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> pilot<00:01:28.470> episodes

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
not season 1 they are the pilot episodes

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
not season 1 they are the pilot episodes
that's<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.210> technically

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that's what they they are technically

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710 
that's what they they are technically
considered<00:01:31.490> they<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> season<00:01:33.299> 2

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
considered they are not a season 2

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.859 
considered they are not a season 2
episodes<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.560> considered<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> season<00:01:35.869> at

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
episodes it's not considered a season at

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.800 
episodes it's not considered a season at
least<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.549> don't<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
least I don't think so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990 
least I don't think so
and<00:01:40.110> not<00:01:40.320> by<00:01:40.470> Lego<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.950> course<00:01:41.189> -<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and not by Lego of course - that is not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
and not by Lego of course - that is not
a<00:01:42.030> season<00:01:43.189> that<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
a season that I would that would be a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.780 
a season that I would that would be a
really<00:01:45.509> really<00:01:45.570> sad<00:01:46.020> season<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
really really sad season that just be so

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.289 
really really sad season that just be so
small<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.649> skeletons<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.790> one

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
small but the skeletons are not one

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
small but the skeletons are not one
season<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.890> when<00:01:53.280> these

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
season now I know I think when these

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.770 
season now I know I think when these
first<00:01:53.729> aired<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.149> might<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.420> been<00:01:54.570> like

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
first aired they might have been like

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.429 
first aired they might have been like
four<00:01:56.149> separate<00:01:57.149> things<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.810> were<00:01:57.899> shorter

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
four separate things that were shorter

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
four separate things that were shorter
not<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> normal<00:01:59.490> episode<00:01:59.700> length<00:02:00.149> but

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
not like a normal episode length but

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
not like a normal episode length but
they<00:02:00.450> sort<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.719> combine<00:02:01.110> them<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.380> think<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
they sort of combine them I think I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
they sort of combine them I think I
don't<00:02:02.250> remember<00:02:02.399> much<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.740> don't

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
don't remember much about this I don't

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
don't remember much about this I don't
know<00:02:04.799> much<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.780> they

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
know much about on this but I think they

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.070 
know much about on this but I think they
did<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.439> four<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:09.030> together<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.810> two

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
did have four but all together it's two

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
did have four but all together it's two
episodes<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> mean<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
episodes now I mean if you put the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.340 
episodes now I mean if you put the
length<00:02:12.510> together<00:02:12.900> they

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
length together they

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.550 
length together they
together<00:02:13.710> in<00:02:13.860> two<00:02:13.950> episodes<00:02:14.070> um<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.350> is<00:02:16.440> on

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
together in two episodes um and it is on

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
of got in Ninjago when the first season

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.980 
of got in Ninjago when the first season
was<00:03:28.770> actually<00:03:29.100> airing<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.120> snakes<00:03:30.420> but

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
was actually airing as the snakes but

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.960 
was actually airing as the snakes but
I've<00:03:31.080> done<00:03:31.260> research<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.460> don't<00:03:32.640> know<00:03:32.820> if

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
I've done research and I don't know if

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.120 
I've done research and I don't know if
they<00:03:33.120> were<00:03:33.240> actually<00:03:33.450> considering<00:03:34.320> making<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
they were actually considering making a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.850 
they were actually considering making a
season<00:03:35.550> or<00:03:35.810> continuing<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.140> think<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.800> was

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
season or continuing it I think it was

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.310 
season or continuing it I think it was
this<00:03:38.010> episodes<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.760> kick<00:03:39.180> off<00:03:39.360> but<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.960> they

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
this episodes to kick off but I they

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.350 
this episodes to kick off but I they
probably<00:03:40.590> were<00:03:41.310> but<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:42.570> wasn't<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.020> season

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
probably were but it wasn't a season

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.270 
probably were but it wasn't a season
that<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.420> know<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.320> know<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.590> Lego<00:03:47.100> has

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that I know that I know and Lego has

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.730 
that I know that I know and Lego has
also<00:03:47.520> said<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.210> is<00:03:48.240> well<00:03:48.720> basically<00:03:49.440> said

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
also said it is well basically said

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.280 
also said it is well basically said
since<00:03:50.520> they<00:03:50.820> say<00:03:51.090> rise<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.930> snakes<00:03:52.170> to
