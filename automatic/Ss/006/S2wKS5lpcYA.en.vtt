something that really I think makes a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.500

ball but I reckon it's really nice it
just<00:00:28.560> sort<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> makes<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.099> bit<00:00:29.279> more

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400

of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.260> cake<00:00:37.320> unless<00:00:38.250> maybe<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.700> something

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
of the cake unless maybe it's something

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520 
of the cake unless maybe it's something
like<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> farm<00:00:39.360> cake<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> bottom<00:00:40.200> needs<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
like a farm cake and the bottom needs to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.970 
like a farm cake and the bottom needs to
be<00:00:40.649> green<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.190> grass<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.879> whatever<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.980> 95%

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
be green for grass or whatever but 95%

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
be green for grass or whatever but 95%
at<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> time<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> same<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> whole<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
at the time it's the same the whole so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
at the time it's the same the whole so
what<00:00:46.500> you'll<00:00:46.680> need<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> vertical

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

using brown fondant and black ribbon

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
using brown fondant and black ribbon
just<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.370> literally<00:00:59.850> what<00:00:59.910> I've

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
just because that's literally what I've

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.500 
just because that's literally what I've
got<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> fondant<00:01:01.379> smoother<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> then

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
got you need a fondant smoother and then

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.539 
got you need a fondant smoother and then
you<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.809> some<00:01:04.049> glue<00:01:04.409> I've<00:01:04.799> also<00:01:05.070> got<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
you need some glue I've also got a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.149 
you need some glue I've also got a
little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.299> glue<00:01:06.950> only<00:01:07.950> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
little bit of this glue only just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.170 
little bit of this glue only just
because<00:01:08.400> I've<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> house<00:01:09.000> it's

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
because I've got it in the house it's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.550 
because I've got it in the house it's
really<00:01:09.420> strong<00:01:09.689> force<00:01:10.020> actually<00:01:10.260> would<00:01:10.409> go

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
really strong force actually would go

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
really strong force actually would go
but<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.799> could<00:01:10.950> use<00:01:10.979> any<00:01:11.159> sort<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but you could use any sort of like I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
but you could use any sort of like I
think<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> stick<00:01:13.320> glue<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> fine<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:13.920> most<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
think the stick glue is fine for most of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
think the stick glue is fine for most of
the<00:01:14.640> ribbon<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.509> then<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.840> at<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> end<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the ribbon but then right at the end I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
the ribbon but then right at the end I
just<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> dab<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
just like to have a dab of like a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.810 
just like to have a dab of like a
stronger<00:01:18.420> craft<00:01:18.720> glue<00:01:19.369> okay<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.700> actually

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
stronger craft glue okay I did actually

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.140 
stronger craft glue okay I did actually
forget<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> mention<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.119> of
