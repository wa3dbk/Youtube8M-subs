okay<00:00:03.629> so<00:00:03.689> next<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.799> have<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.950> look

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
okay so next we're going to have a look

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay so next we're going to have a look
at<00:00:05.250> sim<00:00:05.490> phobia<00:00:05.910> twos<00:00:06.240> individual<00:00:07.140> sections

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
at sim phobia twos individual sections

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.520 
at sim phobia twos individual sections
now<00:00:08.460> whereas<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.300> sim<00:00:09.570> phobia<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.380> will

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
now whereas in sim phobia one you will

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.709 
now whereas in sim phobia one you will
have<00:00:10.679> had<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.160> section<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.849> combined<00:00:12.210> strings

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
have had a section of combined strings

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.289 
have had a section of combined strings
for<00:00:13.049> example<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.740> combined<00:00:14.190> brass<00:00:14.580> you'll

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
for example or combined brass you'll

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.210 
for example or combined brass you'll
find<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.870> sections<00:00:16.260> within<00:00:16.500> sim<00:00:16.890> phobia

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
find that the sections within sim phobia

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640 
find that the sections within sim phobia
two<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.670> slightly<00:00:18.090> more<00:00:18.330> specific<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.470> for

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
two are slightly more specific so for

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.010 
two are slightly more specific so for
example<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> strings<00:00:20.520> are<00:00:20.730> split<00:00:20.970> into<00:00:21.180> just

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
example the strings are split into just

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.349 
example the strings are split into just
violin<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.590> viola<00:00:22.710> sections<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.699> cello

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
violin and viola sections or cello

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.620 
violin and viola sections or cello
sections<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.890> horns<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:27.359> horns

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
sections and the horns have just horns

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.169 
sections and the horns have just horns
with<00:00:27.750> trombones<00:00:28.199> etc<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.640> allows<00:00:29.939> for

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
with trombones etc so this allows for

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.490 
with trombones etc so this allows for
more<00:00:30.300> flexibility<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.170> you're<00:00:31.289> putting

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
more flexibility when you're putting

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280 
more flexibility when you're putting
together<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.949> orchestrations<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:34.020> first

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
together your orchestrations the first

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.720 
together your orchestrations the first
three<00:00:34.559> patches<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> string<00:00:35.579> ensemble

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
three patches the string ensemble

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600 
three patches the string ensemble
extensions<00:00:36.660> various<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> effects<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.550> do

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
extensions various and effects they do

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.940 
extensions various and effects they do
directly<00:00:39.210> complement<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> sim<00:00:40.350> phobia<00:00:40.710> one

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
directly complement the sim phobia one

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
directly complement the sim phobia one
string<00:00:41.579> patches<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.270> they'll<00:00:42.780> blend

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
string patches and they'll blend

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
string patches and they'll blend
perfectly<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.700> many

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
perfectly because there are so many

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
perfectly because there are so many
different<00:00:45.239> articulations<00:00:45.930> I'm<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
different articulations I'm not going to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.200 
different articulations I'm not going to
go<00:00:46.620> through<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.850> pointing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
go through them all I will be pointing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.549 
go through them all I will be pointing
out<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.390> few<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.899> interesting<00:00:49.379> ones

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
out a few the more interesting ones

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.310 
out a few the more interesting ones
along<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> first<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> string

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
along the way so first up the string

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950 
along the way so first up the string
ensemble<00:00:52.640> extensions<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.420> new<00:00:54.570> spicata

wheel when the wheel is pulled down it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.840 
wheel when the wheel is pulled down it's
just<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.309> single<00:00:59.670> staccato<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:01.489> when<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
just a single staccato and when up you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
just a single staccato and when up you
get<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> triple<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> dynamics<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> major

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
get a triple the dynamics of the major

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
get a triple the dynamics of the major
and<00:01:07.830> minor<00:01:08.130> trills<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:08.939> controlled

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
from the mod wheel again they were all

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719
