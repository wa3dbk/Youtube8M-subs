00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:36.650 
follow-through is with those two fingers
toward<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.420> target

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.570 

you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.740 

the<00:02:43.580> third<00:02:43.849> type<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> throw<00:02:44.420> we're<00:02:44.569> going<00:02:44.690> to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
the third type of throw we're going to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.229 
the third type of throw we're going to
talk<00:02:44.930> about<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.560> overarm<00:02:46.099> throw<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
talk about is the overarm throw the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
talk about is the overarm throw the
overarm<00:02:47.720> throw<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:48.500> usually<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.010> most<00:02:49.130> common

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
overarm throw is usually the most common

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.800 
overarm throw is usually the most common
we<00:02:49.849> see<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.360> longer<00:02:50.630> distance<00:02:51.430> throws<00:02:52.430> as

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
we see it for longer distance throws as

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.589 
we see it for longer distance throws as
with<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.530> baseball<00:02:54.739> throw<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.489> lead<00:02:56.360> foot

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
with the the baseball throw a lead foot

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.990 
with the the baseball throw a lead foot
points<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.140> target<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.770> left<00:02:58.519> arm<00:02:58.730> also

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
points of the target a left arm also

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.600 
points of the target a left arm also
points<00:02:59.480> at<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.690> target<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:01.069> difference<00:03:01.430> is

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
points at the target the difference is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.059 
points at the target the difference is
is<00:03:01.849> with<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.989> overarm<00:03:03.380> throw<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.739> elbow

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
is with the overarm throw the elbow

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.990 
is with the overarm throw the elbow
stays<00:03:04.430> straight<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:06.050> we<00:03:06.170> keep<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.560> ball<00:03:07.000> some

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
stays straight so we keep the ball some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
stays straight so we keep the ball some
goalies<00:03:08.330> but<00:03:08.510> smaller<00:03:08.780> hands<00:03:09.110> might<00:03:09.410> use

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
goalies but smaller hands might use

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
goalies but smaller hands might use
their<00:03:09.860> forearm<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.580> hold<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.910> ball<00:03:11.120> with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
their forearm to hold the ball with

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.190 
their forearm to hold the ball with
goalies<00:03:13.670> with<00:03:13.819> larger<00:03:14.180> arms<00:03:14.480> they<00:03:14.959> may<00:03:15.140> be

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
goalies with larger arms they may be

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.530 
goalies with larger arms they may be
able<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:15.830> bend<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.190> wrist<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.730> keep<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
able to just bend the wrist and keep the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.410 
able to just bend the wrist and keep the
ball<00:03:17.720> nice<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:17.989> comfortable<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.910> shoulders

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
ball nice and comfortable the shoulders

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.229

on<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.690> overarm<00:03:21.200> throw<00:03:21.400> start<00:03:22.400> parallel<00:03:22.970> to

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
on the overarm throw start parallel to

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.059 
on the overarm throw start parallel to
the<00:03:23.330> receiver<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.769> we<00:03:24.980> throw<00:03:25.280> we<00:03:26.060> rotate

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
the receiver and as we throw we rotate

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.120 
the receiver and as we throw we rotate
perpendicular<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:29.569> let's<00:03:30.530> take<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.769> look<00:03:31.010> at

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
perpendicular so let's take a look at

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.690 
perpendicular so let's take a look at
what<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.430> might<00:03:31.610> look<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:32.150> real<00:03:32.330> time

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
what this might look like in real time

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.740 
what this might look like in real time
we're<00:03:34.700> going<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.880> take<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> step<00:03:35.420> towards<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
we're going to take a step towards the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.830 
we're going to take a step towards the
target<00:03:36.099> hand<00:03:37.099> pointing<00:03:37.580> at<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.790> ball<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.420> our

pointed down in the ballerina position

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.020 
pointed down in the ballerina position
as<00:04:26.960> we<00:04:27.169> strike<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.650> ball<00:04:27.860> we're<00:04:28.700> going<00:04:28.910> to

younger keepers we like to tell them

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.460 
younger keepers we like to tell them
simply<00:04:43.280> drop<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.580> ball<00:04:43.940> and<00:04:44.240> let<00:04:44.810> let<00:04:45.350> the

ball meet your foot so as we punt the
ball<00:04:49.090> we<00:04:50.090> start<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:51.200> maybe<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.550> o'clock<00:04:52.639> or

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
ball we start in maybe a one o'clock or

a two o'clock position off to the side
of<00:04:55.700> our<00:04:55.820> target<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.590> as<00:04:57.590> we<00:04:57.770> come<00:04:57.950> forward<00:04:58.310> as

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
of our target and as we come forward as

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
we strike the ball our hips rotate

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.580 
we strike the ball our hips rotate
towards<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.720> 12<00:05:03.260> o'clock<00:05:03.560> position<00:05:05.590> for

younger keepers it's probably important

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.690 
younger keepers it's probably important
that<00:05:09.440> they<00:05:09.530> hold<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.830> ball<00:05:10.010> with<00:05:10.190> two<00:05:10.220> hands

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
that they hold the ball with two hands

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.850 
that they hold the ball with two hands
so<00:05:11.510> we<00:05:11.630> don't<00:05:11.810> lose<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.200> ball<00:05:12.380> as<00:05:12.560> we're<00:05:12.710> ready

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
so we don't lose the ball as we're ready

of their kicking foot this allows the

power<00:05:27.710> let's<00:05:28.550> take<00:05:28.729> a<00:05:28.760> look<00:05:29.090> at<00:05:29.210> what<00:05:29.360> this

power let's take a look at what this

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.110 
power let's take a look at what this
might<00:05:29.690> look<00:05:29.870> like<00:05:29.930> in<00:05:30.410> real<00:05:30.979> time<00:05:31.310> from<00:05:31.880> two

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
might look like in real time from two

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:48.350 
might look like in real time from two
hands
