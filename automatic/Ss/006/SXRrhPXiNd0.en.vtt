00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
how to do both brake pads and rotors you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.909 
how to do both brake pads and rotors you
guys<00:00:24.930> might<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> consider<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.860> you're

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
guys might want to consider if you're

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.890 
guys might want to consider if you're
getting<00:00:26.070> rotors<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.210> brake<00:00:27.450> pads<00:00:27.689> just

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
getting rotors get also brake pads just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.740 
getting rotors get also brake pads just
to<00:00:28.020> optimize<00:00:28.380> your<00:00:29.060> braking<00:00:30.060> performance<00:00:30.180> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
to optimize your braking performance and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.299 
to optimize your braking performance and
vice<00:00:31.140> versa<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:31.710> getting<00:00:31.890> pads<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
vice versa if you're getting pads you

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.619 
vice versa if you're getting pads you
might<00:00:32.430> want<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.640> consider<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.270> slotted

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
might want to consider the slotted

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.439 
might want to consider the slotted
rotors<00:00:34.010> better<00:00:35.010> material<00:00:35.610> better

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
rotors better material better

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.070 
rotors better material better
ventilation<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.379> cooling<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> stuff<00:00:38.460> so

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
ventilation for cooling and stuff so

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.310 
ventilation for cooling and stuff so
just<00:00:40.080> something<00:00:40.589> to<00:00:40.739> keep<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.220> mind<00:00:42.320> alright

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just something to keep in mind alright

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
for your brake pads you're going to want

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.920 
for your brake pads you're going to want
to<00:00:45.239> start<00:00:45.449> there's<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:46.050> mounting<00:00:46.890> bolts<00:00:47.220> here

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
to start there's two mounting bolts here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.210 
to start there's two mounting bolts here
there<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:48.989> fourteen<00:00:49.350> millimeter<00:00:49.530> bolts

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
can swing the top of the caliper up to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:24.790 
can swing the top of the caliper up to
get<00:01:04.979> access<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> brake<00:01:05.760> pads

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.120

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
your brake pads you might have to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.230 
your brake pads you might have to
compress<00:01:48.650> your<00:01:49.650> brake<00:01:50.400> cylinder<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
compress your brake cylinder just a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810 
compress your brake cylinder just a
little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.190> have<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.580> do<00:01:53.670> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
little bit which we do have to do on

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
calves with you just remove and use a

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.800 
calves with you just remove and use a
little<00:02:01.170> tool<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.810> you

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
little tool like this which is just you

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
little tool like this which is just you
know<00:02:03.840> simple<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.470> tool<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.250> not

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
know simple little tool you know not

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.740 
know simple little tool you know not
very<00:02:05.640> expensive<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.150> can<00:02:06.240> pick<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
very expensive you can pick it up that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
very expensive you can pick it up that
basically<00:02:07.200> any<00:02:07.500> auto<00:02:08.220> parts<00:02:08.580> star<00:02:09.350> now<00:02:10.350> put

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
basically any auto parts star now put

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.340 
basically any auto parts star now put
the<00:02:11.280> pad<00:02:11.490> against<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.180> cylinder<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.140> like

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the pad against the cylinder there like

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.490 
the pad against the cylinder there like
that<00:02:13.970> put<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.060> tension<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.230> brake

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
that put a little tension on the brake

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.199 
that put a little tension on the brake
pad<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.190> doesn't<00:02:17.220> fall<00:02:17.550> out<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.910> like

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
pad just so it doesn't fall out it like

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:27.199 
pad just so it doesn't fall out it like
you<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.390> saw<00:02:18.720> me<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:24.530> now<00:02:25.530> make<00:02:26.490> sure<00:02:26.730> before

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you just saw me do now make sure before

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.930 
you just saw me do now make sure before
you<00:02:27.570> start<00:02:27.780> doing<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> cap

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
you start doing this you do take the cap

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.199 
you start doing this you do take the cap
off<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:32.040> fill<00:02:32.459> tank<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:32.880> your<00:02:33.000> brake

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
off your your fill tank for your brake

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.240 
off your your fill tank for your brake
slid<00:02:33.480> over<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.750> which<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.080> already<00:02:34.170> did<00:02:34.470> so

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
slid over there which we already did so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.979 
slid over there which we already did so
it's<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.000> very<00:02:36.180> much<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it's not very much that you have to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's not very much that you have to
compress<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.830> car<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.370> because

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
compress on this car just because

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.130 
compress on this car just because
practically<00:02:40.200> brand<00:02:40.470> new<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:42.660> about<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
practically brand new so just about that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.640 
practically brand new so just about that
much<00:02:43.350> will<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:45.860> now<00:02:46.860> reinstall

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:06.119
