00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.310
 from 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.939
 the spectacular of youth 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.329
 fast other on high 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:38.079
 we build an approximately 12 to 15 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.120
 We call it machines every year 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.519
 are sold worldwide and then must 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.629

 we get a visit from minister kamp van 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.609
 economics 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.470
 give the following lower presentation about 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.480
 about how our company stands within europe 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390
 and what the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.830
 The pros and cons are doing business 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.470
 within europe also outside in europe 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.760
 and possibly make them easier 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.890
 against 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.740
 things that run into that 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.980
 to discuss with him 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.200
 our philosophy is a fairground attraction too 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.650
 build or build a machine that 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 as compact as possible so that 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.480
 he with as little manpower as possible 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.150
 to build on and so little 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.460
 possible transport and transport 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.650
 be the cost for the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.960
 the operators use in this case 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.210
 as low as possible 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.100
 we actually satisfy all 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 regulations that are both in 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.820
 America as within Europe as in other 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.570

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.250
 newest techniques out there 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.259
 in order to build attractions we have one 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.520
 workplace involving the attractions 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.610
 composition 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.140
 this workplace is also unique in need 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.050
 arena 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.300
 so we can make the roof as with the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.580
 fully open up the arena in amsterdam 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.410
 so that we like the attractions 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.959
 be able to build and test completely 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 test run so that the customer a 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.040
 100% machine to take with you at the moment 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.319
 that he comes to pick up 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540
 tips to you can either side him too 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.290
 foam will slide from both sides 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.579
 have time and mean showbizz 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.280
 so the over got the construction 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.579
 outside also for the day but also
