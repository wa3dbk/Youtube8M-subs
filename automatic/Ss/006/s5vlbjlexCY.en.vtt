he is deciding to fast expansion i do

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.610 
he is deciding to fast expansion i do
not<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.579> right<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.629> you'll<00:02:40.140> see

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
not know that right now and you'll see

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.199 
not know that right now and you'll see
my<00:02:40.739> second<00:02:41.099> gas<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.459> up<00:02:41.609> soon<00:02:41.790> right<00:02:41.849> when

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
my second gas going up soon right when

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.449 
my second gas going up soon right when
his<00:02:42.329> Overlord<00:02:42.900> gets<00:02:43.109> out<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.470> range<00:02:43.650> there<00:02:43.980> so

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
his Overlord gets out of range there so

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.949 
his Overlord gets out of range there so
you<00:02:44.549> always<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.819> what's<00:02:45.180> about<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> come

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959

you always know what's about to come
when<00:02:46.139> a<00:02:46.170> second<00:02:46.560> gas<00:02:46.709> goes<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.040> we'll<00:02:47.909> see<00:02:47.940> if

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
when a second gas goes up we'll see if

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.440 
when a second gas goes up we'll see if
that<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.959> successful<00:02:49.440> or<00:02:49.859> not<00:02:50.120> he<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.209> putting

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that is successful or not he is putting

that is successful or not he is putting
down<00:02:51.720> his<00:02:51.930> roach<00:02:52.170> warding<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:53.040> not<00:02:53.310> say<00:02:53.489> this

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
down his roach warding I do not say this

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
down his roach warding I do not say this
what<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> am<00:02:54.090> doing<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.420> keeping<00:02:54.599> an<00:02:54.870> overlord

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
what I am doing is keeping an overlord

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500 
what I am doing is keeping an overlord
right<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.159> can<00:02:56.579> see<00:02:56.730> both<00:02:56.940> geysers<00:02:57.480> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
right here I can see both geysers and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.789 
right here I can see both geysers and
this<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.840> an<00:02:57.959> awesome<00:02:58.139> trick<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.769> learned

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
this is an awesome trick that I learned

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.679 
this is an awesome trick that I learned
and<00:02:59.159> you<00:02:59.609> can<00:02:59.760> actually<00:02:59.909> tell<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> lot<00:03:00.450> just

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
and you can actually tell a lot just

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.289 
and you can actually tell a lot just
from<00:03:00.870> what<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.290> person<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.920> mining<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.939> so<00:03:03.120> if

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
from what a person is mining and so if

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.300 
from what a person is mining and so if
he<00:03:03.450> was<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:03.930> get<00:03:04.079> another<00:03:04.379> extractor<00:03:04.980> here<00:03:05.159> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
he was to get another extractor here I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.429 
he was to get another extractor here I
would<00:03:05.549> start<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.269> detect<00:03:06.629> mutis<00:03:07.049> or<00:03:07.230> maybe

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
would start to detect mutis or maybe

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.559 
would start to detect mutis or maybe
even<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.799> Hydra<00:03:08.069> lyst<00:03:08.280> build<00:03:08.519> or<00:03:08.909> something

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
even a Hydra lyst build or something

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.210 
even a Hydra lyst build or something
techy<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.230> because<00:03:10.530> he's<00:03:10.709> not<00:03:10.859> doing<00:03:11.189> that

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
techy but because he's not doing that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.599 
techy but because he's not doing that
I'm<00:03:12.030> kind<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.540> expecting<00:03:13.170> roaches<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.859> even

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
I'm kind of expecting roaches and even

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.460 
I'm kind of expecting roaches and even
I'm<00:03:14.790> even<00:03:15.329> expecting<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.840> fast<00:03:16.019> expansion

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
I'm even expecting the fast expansion

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.990 
I'm even expecting the fast expansion
which<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.889> why<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.099> see<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> am<00:03:17.489> moving<00:03:17.910> this

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
which is why you see I am moving this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.819 
which is why you see I am moving this
over<00:03:18.180> though<00:03:18.389> over<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.410> looks<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.620> he's

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
over though over but it looks like he's

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.319 
over though over but it looks like he's
sending<00:03:20.129> out<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> couple<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.639> zerglings<00:03:20.910> scouts

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
sending out a couple of zerglings scouts

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.280 
sending out a couple of zerglings scouts
where<00:03:21.599> they're<00:03:21.750> going<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.199> don't<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:24.290> and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
where they're going I don't know and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.140 
where they're going I don't know and
right<00:03:25.530> when<00:03:25.560> my<00:03:25.769> queen<00:03:26.040> pops<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.489> went<00:03:26.910> layer

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
right when my queen pops I went layer

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.030 
right when my queen pops I went layer
tech<00:03:27.419> I've<00:03:27.569> got<00:03:27.720> three<00:03:27.989> guys<00:03:28.139> on<00:03:28.199> each<00:03:28.709> geyser

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
tech I've got three guys on each geyser

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.159 
tech I've got three guys on each geyser
and<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.940> could<00:03:30.120> use<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.269> couple<00:03:30.540> more<00:03:30.659> drones<00:03:30.989> on

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
and I could use a couple more drones on

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.809 
and I could use a couple more drones on
minerals<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.829> that's<00:03:32.069> what<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.430> doing<00:03:32.699> I'm

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819

right<00:04:32.450> when<00:04:32.600> my<00:04:32.720> lair<00:04:32.930> got<00:04:33.140> done<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.590> then<00:04:33.800> I

starcraft tactics but I put my creep

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.940 
starcraft tactics but I put my creep
down<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.690> then<00:04:44.840> put<00:04:45.020> my<00:04:45.140> spire<00:04:45.410> in<00:04:45.620> a<00:04:45.680> hidden

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
down and then put my spire in a hidden

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.010 
down and then put my spire in a hidden
location<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.610> if<00:04:46.760> he<00:04:46.880> does<00:04:47.120> like<00:04:47.720> send<00:04:47.960> a

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
location so if he does like send a

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.160 
location so if he does like send a
changeling<00:04:48.500> or<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.740> suicide<00:04:49.040> overlord<00:04:49.670> or<00:04:49.850> a

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
changeling or a suicide overlord or a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.290 
changeling or a suicide overlord or a
overseer<00:04:51.170> in<00:04:51.980> this<00:04:52.250> area<00:04:52.610> he<00:04:52.820> won't<00:04:53.000> see<00:04:53.180> my

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
overseer in this area he won't see my

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.030 
overseer in this area he won't see my
virus<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:53.840> I'm<00:04:53.930> hoping<00:04:54.200> that'll<00:04:54.470> work<00:04:54.590> out<00:04:54.800> for

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
virus so I'm hoping that'll work out for

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.310 
virus so I'm hoping that'll work out for
me<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:55.880> far<00:04:55.940> he<00:04:56.360> does<00:04:56.540> have<00:04:56.720> an<00:04:56.840> evolution

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
me so far he does have an evolution

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320 
me so far he does have an evolution
chamber<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.890> look<00:04:58.430> at<00:04:58.520> this<00:04:58.640> he<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:58.970> getting<00:04:59.270> a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
chamber and look at this he is getting a

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.960 
chamber and look at this he is getting a
spore<00:04:59.570> color<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.050> he<00:05:00.260> either<00:05:00.530> saw<00:05:00.920> my<00:05:01.340> spire

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
spore color so he either saw my spire

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.150 
spore color so he either saw my spire
here<00:05:02.330> or<00:05:02.510> he<00:05:02.750> just<00:05:02.930> assumed<00:05:03.380> with<00:05:03.950> this

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
here or he just assumed with this

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.310 
here or he just assumed with this
zergling<00:05:04.610> which<00:05:04.910> got<00:05:05.090> around<00:05:05.330> right<00:05:05.540> here<00:05:05.570> he

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
zergling which got around right here he

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.660 
zergling which got around right here he
just<00:05:06.470> assumed<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:06.920> was<00:05:07.100> getting<00:05:07.400> inspired

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
just assumed I was getting inspired

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.150 
just assumed I was getting inspired
because<00:05:07.910> he<00:05:08.120> saw<00:05:08.300> my<00:05:08.450> lair<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:09.010> even<00:05:10.010> though<00:05:10.130> i

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
because he saw my lair so even though i

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.580 
because he saw my lair so even though i
did<00:05:10.460> use<00:05:10.640> this<00:05:10.790> trick<00:05:11.090> i<00:05:11.330> wasn't<00:05:12.200> able<00:05:12.410> to

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
did use this trick i wasn't able to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.930 
did use this trick i wasn't able to
utilize<00:05:12.890> it<00:05:13.070> because<00:05:13.310> she<00:05:13.490> just<00:05:13.670> made<00:05:13.820> an

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
utilize it because she just made an

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.340 
utilize it because she just made an
assumption<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.420> i<00:05:14.570> was<00:05:14.780> getting<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> fire

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
assumption that i was getting a fire

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.220 
assumption that i was getting a fire
from<00:05:15.650> my<00:05:15.770> lair<00:05:15.950> and<00:05:16.190> he<00:05:16.430> was<00:05:16.580> correct<00:05:17.000> my<00:05:17.930> spire

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
from my lair and he was correct my spire

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.560 
from my lair and he was correct my spire
is<00:05:18.560> up<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:19.790> i<00:05:19.910> am<00:05:20.090> pumping<00:05:20.450> out<00:05:20.570> for<00:05:20.960> medalist

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
is up and i am pumping out for medalist

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.380 
is up and i am pumping out for medalist
problem<00:05:23.570> is<00:05:24.130> he's<00:05:25.130> got<00:05:25.400> these<00:05:25.640> for<00:05:25.910> crawlers

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
problem is he's got these for crawlers

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.270 
problem is he's got these for crawlers
he<00:05:27.110> does<00:05:27.260> have<00:05:27.380> quite<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.650> few<00:05:27.740> roaches<00:05:28.010> he

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
he does have quite a few roaches he

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.410 
he does have quite a few roaches he
can't<00:05:28.490> really<00:05:28.700> move<00:05:28.820> out<00:05:29.000> with<00:05:29.150> him<00:05:29.270> though

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
can't really move out with him though

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.030 
can't really move out with him though
because<00:05:29.570> otherwise<00:05:29.960> my<00:05:30.080> mutants<00:05:30.590> will<00:05:30.770> pick

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
because otherwise my mutants will pick

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.950 
because otherwise my mutants will pick
them<00:05:31.190> up<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:31.910> they're<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.120> gotta<00:05:32.390> content<00:05:32.840> to

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
them up so they're just gotta content to

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.510 
them up so they're just gotta content to
chill<00:05:33.350> in<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.470> base<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.920> have<00:05:34.490> a

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
chill in the base and have a

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.280 
chill in the base and have a
conversation<00:05:34.750> don't<00:05:35.750> know<00:05:35.810> what<00:05:35.960> they<00:05:36.050> talked

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
conversation don't know what they talked

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.050 
conversation don't know what they talked
about<00:05:36.320> but<00:05:36.830> second<00:05:37.490> guys<00:05:37.610> are<00:05:37.790> going<00:05:38.030> down

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
about but second guys are going down

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.360 
about but second guys are going down
he's<00:05:38.450> only<00:05:38.480> got<00:05:38.960> a<00:05:38.990> few<00:05:39.290> guys<00:05:39.500> on<00:05:39.710> minerals<00:05:40.220> at

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
he's only got a few guys on minerals at

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.430 
he's only got a few guys on minerals at
his<00:05:40.670> expansion<00:05:41.090> so<00:05:41.390> he's<00:05:41.540> not<00:05:41.660> used<00:05:41.840> using<00:05:42.320> it

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
his expansion so he's not used using it

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.340 
his expansion so he's not used using it
too<00:05:43.400> well<00:05:43.640> and<00:05:44.270> he<00:05:44.390> also<00:05:44.540> has<00:05:44.750> a<00:05:44.840> couple<00:05:45.110> spore

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
too well and he also has a couple spore

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.370 
too well and he also has a couple spore
crawlers<00:05:45.740> there<00:05:45.890> as<00:05:46.010> well<00:05:47.050> spore<00:05:48.050> crawlers

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
crawlers there as well spore crawlers

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.410 
crawlers there as well spore crawlers
not<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.800> position<00:05:49.160> of<00:05:49.250> him<00:05:49.400> not<00:05:49.610> oh<00:05:49.850> here<00:05:50.390> we

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
not the position of him not oh here we

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.300 
not the position of him not oh here we
go<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:51.320> position<00:05:51.740> of<00:05:51.830> him<00:05:51.980> isn't<00:05:52.130> as

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
go the position of him isn't as

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.920 
go the position of him isn't as
important<00:05:52.640> as<00:05:52.760> it<00:05:52.910> was<00:05:53.120> in<00:05:53.330> starcraft<00:05:53.810> one

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
important as it was in starcraft one

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.020 
important as it was in starcraft one
because<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.290> can<00:05:54.620> move<00:05:54.770> them<00:05:54.950> around<00:05:55.070> so<00:05:55.430> you

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
because you can move them around so you

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.910 
because you can move them around so you
know<00:05:56.390> if<00:05:56.660> i<00:05:56.810> decide<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.260> like<00:05:57.380> go<00:05:57.530> right<00:05:57.680> here

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
know if i decide to like go right here

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.260 
know if i decide to like go right here
and<00:05:58.070> start<00:05:58.220> attacking<00:05:58.280> at<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.760> tree<00:05:59.000> he<00:05:59.150> could

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
and start attacking at a tree he could

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.940 
and start attacking at a tree he could
always<00:05:59.450> move<00:05:59.630> them<00:05:59.840> around<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.320> support<00:06:00.770> the

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
then while they move with this queen but

then while they move with this queen but
look<00:06:03.170> at<00:06:03.260> this<00:06:03.350> i<00:06:03.590> am<00:06:03.710> doing<00:06:04.070> a<00:06:04.220> double<00:06:04.550> attack

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
look at this i am doing a double attack

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.640 
look at this i am doing a double attack
here<00:06:05.150> I've<00:06:05.540> got<00:06:05.720> my<00:06:05.810> surgeries<00:06:06.170> in<00:06:06.380> one<00:06:06.410> way

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
here I've got my surgeries in one way

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.930 
here I've got my surgeries in one way
and<00:06:06.830> my<00:06:06.920> middle<00:06:07.100> is<00:06:07.250> harassing<00:06:07.550> in<00:06:07.820> his

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
and my middle is harassing in his

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.550 
and my middle is harassing in his
roaches<00:06:08.240> trying<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.020> come<00:06:09.140> and<00:06:09.290> take<00:06:09.410> out<00:06:09.530> the

roaches trying to come and take out the
zerglings<00:06:10.550> one<00:06:10.970> meal<00:06:11.570> this<00:06:11.750> gets<00:06:11.990> a<00:06:12.050> little

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
zerglings one meal this gets a little

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.410 
zerglings one meal this gets a little
bit<00:06:12.380> out<00:06:13.340> of<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.580> group<00:06:13.760> and<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.090> does<00:06:14.120> take<00:06:14.390> a

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
bit out of the group and it does take a

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.880 
bit out of the group and it does take a
little<00:06:14.570> bit<00:06:14.720> of<00:06:14.810> damage<00:06:15.020> but<00:06:15.320> his<00:06:15.500> roaches

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
little bit of damage but his roaches

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.230 
little bit of damage but his roaches
moved<00:06:16.100> down<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.310> his<00:06:16.580> expansion<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.150> I'm

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
moved down to his expansion so I'm

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.820 
moved down to his expansion so I'm
taking<00:06:17.540> advantage<00:06:17.900> of<00:06:17.930> that<00:06:18.080> taking

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
taking advantage of that taking

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.220 
taking advantage of that taking
advantage<00:06:18.920> of<00:06:19.310> my<00:06:19.460> circling<00:06:19.910> speed<00:06:20.210> to<00:06:20.720> run<00:06:20.750> to

his main base and just get in his

his main base and just get in his
minerals<00:06:23.540> and<00:06:23.990> try<00:06:24.140> to<00:06:24.200> kill<00:06:24.470> whatever<00:06:24.800> I<00:06:25.100> can

minerals and try to kill whatever I can
you'll<00:06:26.060> notice<00:06:26.270> here<00:06:26.570> in<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:26.960> second<00:06:27.470> if<00:06:27.560> you

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
you'll notice here in a second if you

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.100 
you'll notice here in a second if you
can<00:06:27.830> see<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.250> that's<00:06:29.120> a<00:06:29.240> little<00:06:29.660> better<00:06:29.780> view

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
can see it that's a little better view

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.280 
can see it that's a little better view
maybe<00:06:30.370> not<00:06:31.370> I<00:06:31.610> am<00:06:32.000> focusing<00:06:32.750> these<00:06:32.930> four

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
maybe not I am focusing these four

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.600 
maybe not I am focusing these four
crawlers<00:06:33.680> I'm<00:06:33.830> trying<00:06:34.070> to<00:06:34.130> take<00:06:34.310> those<00:06:34.460> out

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
crawlers I'm trying to take those out

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.780 
crawlers I'm trying to take those out
and<00:06:34.820> then<00:06:35.030> my<00:06:35.060> mutants<00:06:35.479> will

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
and then my mutants will

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.190 
and then my mutants will
able<00:06:35.910> to<00:06:35.970> go<00:06:36.090> in<00:06:36.210> and<00:06:36.330> clean<00:06:36.630> up<00:06:36.750> whatever<00:06:36.960> they

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
able to go in and clean up whatever they

three i could just do whatever I want
over<00:06:44.010> his<00:06:44.190> mane<00:06:44.460> he's<00:06:44.670> got<00:06:44.820> a<00:06:44.850> lot<00:06:45.060> of<00:06:45.120> roaches

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
over his mane he's got a lot of roaches

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.150 
over his mane he's got a lot of roaches
and<00:06:45.720> you<00:06:45.840> know<00:06:46.020> he<00:06:46.230> is<00:06:46.380> gonna<00:06:46.560> send<00:06:46.770> us<00:06:46.860> at<00:06:47.040> me

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
and you know he is gonna send us at me

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.830 
and you know he is gonna send us at me
right<00:06:47.370> away<00:06:47.490> because<00:06:47.790> this<00:06:48.630> base<00:06:48.810> is

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
right away because this base is

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.720 
right away because this base is
unprotected<00:06:49.470> but<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.770> can<00:06:49.980> kill<00:06:50.190> all<00:06:50.460> of<00:06:50.490> the

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
unprotected but I can kill all of the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.360 
unprotected but I can kill all of the
drones<00:06:50.910> I<00:06:51.120> want<00:06:51.360> they<00:06:51.930> are<00:06:52.140> all<00:06:52.410> dead<00:06:52.440> he<00:06:53.160> was

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
drones I want they are all dead he was

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.890 
drones I want they are all dead he was
able<00:06:53.460> to<00:06:53.640> transfer<00:06:53.970> quite<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.270> few<00:06:54.510> actually

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
able to transfer quite a few actually

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.260 
able to transfer quite a few actually
and<00:06:55.470> now<00:06:55.590> his<00:06:55.800> main<00:06:56.100> base<00:06:56.310> is<00:06:56.580> unguarded<00:06:57.180> and

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
and now his main base is unguarded and

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.850 
and now his main base is unguarded and
hopefully<00:06:57.660> I'll<00:06:57.780> be<00:06:57.810> able<00:06:57.990> to<00:06:58.140> use<00:06:58.830> that

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
hopefully I'll be able to use that

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.370 
hopefully I'll be able to use that
advantage<00:06:59.370> to<00:06:59.640> try<00:06:59.820> to<00:06:59.880> take<00:07:00.090> this<00:07:00.300> game<00:07:00.600> but

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
advantage to try to take this game but

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.600 
advantage to try to take this game but
right<00:07:01.590> now<00:07:01.650> I<00:07:01.770> need<00:07:01.920> to<00:07:02.130> worry<00:07:02.280> about<00:07:02.400> these

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
right now I need to worry about these

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.730 
right now I need to worry about these
attacking<00:07:03.120> roaches<00:07:03.510> I<00:07:03.690> can't<00:07:04.260> just<00:07:04.440> use<00:07:04.590> my

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
attacking roaches I can't just use my

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.990 
attacking roaches I can't just use my
mutants<00:07:05.010> to<00:07:05.070> take<00:07:05.250> out<00:07:05.370> his<00:07:05.460> main<00:07:05.640> base<00:07:05.820> that

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
mutants to take out his main base that

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.670 
mutants to take out his main base that
would<00:07:06.090> take<00:07:06.240> way<00:07:06.540> too<00:07:06.570> long<00:07:06.780> and<00:07:07.260> these

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
would take way too long and these

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.530 
would take way too long and these
roaches<00:07:07.890> will<00:07:08.550> get<00:07:08.700> to<00:07:08.820> my<00:07:08.910> base<00:07:09.090> eventually

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540 
roaches will get to my base eventually

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.860 
roaches will get to my base eventually
and<00:07:09.720> try<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:09.960> kill<00:07:10.230> me<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:11.540> don't<00:07:12.540> really<00:07:12.720> have

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870 
and try to kill me I don't really have

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.240 
and try to kill me I don't really have
any<00:07:13.050> defenses<00:07:13.230> I<00:07:13.650> am<00:07:13.770> putting<00:07:13.980> up<00:07:14.130> my

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
any defenses I am putting up my

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.220 
any defenses I am putting up my
expansion<00:07:14.760> over<00:07:15.000> here<00:07:15.180> meanwhile<00:07:15.570> his<00:07:15.930> drones

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
expansion over here meanwhile his drones

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.230 
expansion over here meanwhile his drones
were<00:07:16.440> transferred<00:07:16.950> to<00:07:16.980> this<00:07:17.160> expansion<00:07:17.580> the

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 
were transferred to this expansion the

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.230 
were transferred to this expansion the
only<00:07:18.420> good<00:07:18.570> thing<00:07:18.630> I<00:07:18.900> have<00:07:19.080> going<00:07:19.460> is<00:07:20.460> that<00:07:20.790> he

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
only good thing I have going is that he

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.490 
only good thing I have going is that he
is<00:07:21.450> not<00:07:21.750> mining<00:07:22.200> gaps<00:07:22.530> in<00:07:22.800> this<00:07:22.950> expansion<00:07:23.400> so

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
is not mining gaps in this expansion so

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.260 
is not mining gaps in this expansion so
that's<00:07:25.500> a<00:07:25.740> you<00:07:26.070> know<00:07:26.190> one<00:07:26.400> upside<00:07:26.850> he's

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
that's a you know one upside he's

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.580 
that's a you know one upside he's
getting<00:07:27.540> his<00:07:27.660> poor<00:07:27.870> crawler<00:07:28.110> at<00:07:28.260> this<00:07:28.410> new

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
getting his poor crawler at this new

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.810 
getting his poor crawler at this new
base<00:07:28.770> and<00:07:29.010> he's<00:07:29.100> actually<00:07:29.250> getting<00:07:29.460> too<00:07:29.790> I

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:29.820 
base and he's actually getting too I

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.570 
base and he's actually getting too I
didn't<00:07:30.270> see<00:07:30.420> this
