computer just real right here a gigabyte
RAM<00:01:52.759> 3.40<00:01:53.759> gigahertz<00:01:55.159> that's<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> i7<00:01:56.880> let's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
RAM 3.40 gigahertz that's the i7 let's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.100 
RAM 3.40 gigahertz that's the i7 let's
get<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:59.149> okay<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
get out of that okay this is just a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.510 
get out of that okay this is just a
little<00:02:01.320> feature<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> out<00:02:02.100> real<00:02:02.250> quick

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
little feature get that out real quick

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.149 
little feature get that out real quick
so<00:02:02.700> y'all<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.290> let's<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.469> how<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> fast

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so y'all think let's see how to fast

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.139 
so y'all think let's see how to fast
internet<00:02:05.729> loads<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.299> internet<00:02:06.810> button<00:02:07.110> so

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
internet loads that's internet button so

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.610 
internet loads that's internet button so
one<00:02:09.149> two<00:02:09.690> three

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.030 

so<00:02:14.620> that's<00:02:14.800> how<00:02:14.920> fast<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.460> real<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.730> loads<00:02:16.090> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so that's how fast and real it loads I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.140 
so that's how fast and real it loads I
don't<00:02:18.040> know<00:02:18.130> if<00:02:18.190> y'all<00:02:18.340> see<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.580> shot<00:02:19.000> at
