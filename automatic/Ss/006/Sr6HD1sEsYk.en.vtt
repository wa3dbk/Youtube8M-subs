clearly might benefit from new options
there's<00:05:24.570> other<00:05:24.780> individuals<00:05:25.440> whose<00:05:25.650> the

there's other individuals whose the

there's other individuals whose the

disease is well controlled with
phlebotomy<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.100> aspirin<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.699> perhaps<00:05:30.300> for

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
phlebotomy and aspirin and perhaps for

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.060 
phlebotomy and aspirin and perhaps for
them<00:05:30.750> we<00:05:30.900> should<00:05:30.930> leave<00:05:31.260> things<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:31.770> they<00:05:31.800> are

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
them we should leave things as they are

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.180 
them we should leave things as they are
so<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.240> time<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.450> tremendous

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
so it's a time of tremendous

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.370 
so it's a time of tremendous
productivity<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.760> time<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.360> many<00:05:36.599> new<00:05:36.840> trials

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
productivity a time of many new trials

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.250 
productivity a time of many new trials
and<00:05:37.590> at<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.370> time<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.360> think<00:05:39.630> that<00:05:39.780> we<00:05:39.900> will<00:05:40.020> see

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
and at a time I think that we will see

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.680 
and at a time I think that we will see
in<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.500> near<00:05:40.770> future<00:05:41.180> significant<00:05:42.180> advances

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
in the near future significant advances

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.330 
in the near future significant advances
