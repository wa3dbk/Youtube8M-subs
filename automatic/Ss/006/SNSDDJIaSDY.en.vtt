figure<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.099> out<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> g2<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.090> G<00:02:09.479> pad

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
figure it out out of the g2 of G pad

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
figure it out out of the g2 of G pad
software<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.440> G<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.129> almost<00:02:11.550> identical

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
software is that G is almost identical

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
software is that G is almost identical
as<00:02:12.270> i<00:02:12.510> said<00:02:12.810> as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
as i said as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.250 
as i said as

three fingers fight it and when you need
it<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.230> slide<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.500> back<00:02:19.850> thus<00:02:21.530> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it back you can slide it back thus you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.430 
it back you can slide it back thus you
know<00:02:22.620> g<00:02:22.920> two<00:02:23.100> functions<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:25.020> only
