actually got the volume control on top
with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> ribbon<00:01:03.809> cable<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:04.559> another<00:01:05.159> hole

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
with a ribbon cable we got another hole

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
with a ribbon cable we got another hole
there<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> underneath<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.840> where<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there and underneath there where the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350

and<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.020> date<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.380> amplifiers<00:01:10.740> worked

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
and how date and amplifiers worked

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.700 
and how date and amplifiers worked
anyway<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.930> both<00:01:13.229> has<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.340> called<00:01:14.689> sound

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
anyway well both has a so called sound

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
anyway well both has a so called sound
portable<00:01:16.710> sound<00:01:16.890> system<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.549> yourself<00:01:17.700> or

iPod<00:01:19.170> dock<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.070> well<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> iPod<00:01:21.509> dock<00:01:21.750> those

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
iPod dock and well the iPod dock those

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.460 
iPod dock and well the iPod dock those
things

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
things

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
things
it<00:01:22.680> sucks<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.600> wanted<00:01:24.900> something<00:01:24.960> way

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it sucks so we wanted something way

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
it sucks so we wanted something way
better<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.280> still<00:01:26.460> wanted<00:01:26.880> balls<00:01:28.040> because

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
better but still wanted balls because

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.300 
better but still wanted balls because
they<00:01:29.280> kind<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.579> sound<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.030> sweet<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.310> this

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
they kind of sound pretty sweet and this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
they kind of sound pretty sweet and this
sounds<00:01:32.729> better<00:01:32.880> than<00:01:33.030> any<00:01:33.329> old<00:01:33.540> iPod<00:01:34.140> dock

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sounds better than any old iPod dock

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950 
sounds better than any old iPod dock
from<00:01:35.220> Bose<00:01:35.430> even<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> most<00:01:36.180> expensive<00:01:36.540> one

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
from Bose even the most expensive one

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
from Bose even the most expensive one
and<00:01:37.369> then<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.790> thousand<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then that's a thousand was it it's

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.880 
and then that's a thousand was it it's
$600<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.100> $700<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:41.880> whatever<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> know<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
$600 or $700 or whatever you know and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
$600 or $700 or whatever you know and
this<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.729> 2.3<00:01:45.630> hour<00:01:45.960> battery

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this right here has 2.3 hour battery

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
this right here has 2.3 hour battery
which<00:01:46.680> will<00:01:46.979> probably<00:01:47.369> last<00:01:47.729> quite<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> long

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
which will probably last quite a long

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.950 
which will probably last quite a long
time<00:01:48.950> given<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> Dayton<00:01:50.430> amplifier<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.479> in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
time given the Dayton amplifier and in

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.429 
time given the Dayton amplifier and in
our<00:01:52.110> history<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.619> last<00:01:52.920> 12<00:01:53.369> hours<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:54.439> what's

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
ours and that's Blaine really loud and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.730 
ours and that's Blaine really loud and
and<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> see<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.200> connected<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and you see it's not connected to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.459 
and you see it's not connected to
anything<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:03.140> those<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
anything right there those are the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.679 
anything right there those are the
regular<00:02:04.920> inputs<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> regular<00:02:06.360> inputs
