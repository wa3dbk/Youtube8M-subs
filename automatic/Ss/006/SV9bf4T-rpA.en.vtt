people<00:02:49.010> when<00:02:49.160> they<00:02:49.250> were<00:02:49.340> developing<00:02:49.550> i've

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
people when they were developing i've

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.000 
people when they were developing i've
been<00:02:50.840> doing<00:02:50.960> that<00:02:51.200> they<00:02:51.410> weren't<00:02:51.920> interested

in<00:02:52.490> increasing<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.300> guy<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:54.620> decreasing<00:02:55.400> so

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
in increasing this guy not decreasing so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.390 
in increasing this guy not decreasing so
it's<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.300> different<00:02:56.690> direction<00:02:56.870> entirely<00:02:57.590> but

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
it's a different direction entirely but

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.010 
it's a different direction entirely but
it<00:02:58.520> makes<00:02:58.700> use<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.210> same<00:02:59.480> sort<00:02:59.990> of

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
it makes use of the same sort of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.050 
it makes use of the same sort of
physical<00:03:00.320> principles<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:01.580> needed<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.940> way

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
physical principles if you needed a way

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.210 
physical principles if you needed a way
to<00:03:02.090> compress<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.810> down<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.770> temperature

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
to compress this down so the temperature

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370 
to compress this down so the temperature
of<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.670> plasma<00:03:04.880> being<00:03:05.390> 100<00:03:05.840> million<00:03:06.110> degree

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
of the plasma being 100 million degree

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.160 
of the plasma being 100 million degree
range<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.610> pretty<00:03:07.880> hot<00:03:08.060> yeah<00:03:08.630> I'm<00:03:08.750> active<00:03:09.050> on
