00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.260 
Pekka I mean so far the rate is going
pretty<00:02:39.690> smoothly<00:02:40.110> we<00:02:41.070> do<00:02:41.250> have<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.520> possibility

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
pretty smoothly we do have a possibility

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.910 
pretty smoothly we do have a possibility
of<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.450> three-star<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.140> as<00:02:43.320> long<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.830> can

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
of a three-star here as long as we can

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.760 
of a three-star here as long as we can
keep<00:02:43.980> these<00:02:44.280> pekka's<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> hopefully<00:02:45.770> okay

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
keep these pekka's up and hopefully okay

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.560 
keep these pekka's up and hopefully okay
so<00:02:46.830> we<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.100> one<00:02:47.280> pega<00:02:47.489> left<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.300> looks<00:02:48.510> like

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
so we have one pega left it looks like

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.850 
so we have one pega left it looks like
he's<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.140> took<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.590> by<00:02:49.709> that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
he's going to get took it out by that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
he's going to get took it out by that
cannon<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.430> these<00:02:50.670> Wizards<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.330> possibly

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810

one shot that gold mine or at least
close<00:02:56.190> shot<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.320> not<00:02:58.320> really<00:02:58.500> sure<00:02:58.709> about

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
close shot it so not really sure about

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.560 
close shot it so not really sure about
the<00:02:59.220> three-star<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.910> guys<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.420> looks

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the three-star you guys but it looks

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.970 
the three-star you guys but it looks
like<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> clear<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.680> lot<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
like we are going to clear up a lot of

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.620 
like we are going to clear up a lot of
percentages<00:03:02.489> if<00:03:02.730> these<00:03:02.880> Wizards<00:03:03.269> can<00:03:03.450> take

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
percentages if these Wizards can take

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.000 
percentages if these Wizards can take
out<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.930> cannon<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.739> that's<00:03:04.890> going

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
out this cannon don't think that's going

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.190 
out this cannon don't think that's going
to<00:03:05.070> happen<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.390> might<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.570> well<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.840> go

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
to happen so we might as well just go

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.590 
to happen so we might as well just go
ahead<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.440> watch<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.190> raid<00:03:08.400> go<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.850> an<00:03:08.940> end<00:03:09.120> we

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
ahead and watch the raid go to an end we

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.150 
ahead and watch the raid go to an end we
have<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:09.959> more<00:03:10.140> goal<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.500> left<00:03:10.709> actually<00:03:10.920> no

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
have one more goal and left actually no

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.530 
have one more goal and left actually no
we<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> few<00:03:11.610> are<00:03:11.760> true<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.390> am<00:03:12.480> I
