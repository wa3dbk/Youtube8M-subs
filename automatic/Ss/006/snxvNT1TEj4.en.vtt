 have also made me a cup of tea and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.570
 Let's get started then you will start 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.610
 really to buy next to cake and 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.769
 to decorate I'm never really like that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.420
 that's why cake is so, too 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.170
 not in the cake in september 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.610
 to buy 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.470
 I always come when my mom 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.540
 thanks yourself but that is always 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.970
 only in december and with 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.040
 christmas decoration always pending such a thing 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.299
 a bit behind you as you can see 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.850
 right now just behind me 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.650
 fairy lights and a fir tree like that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.420
 is also the only christmas decoration the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.460
 just in my room is and the rest 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.680
 is very unimportant but i hope that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.360
 me just before christmas again 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.189
 to get a little something to the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.500
 how stressful it is 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.600
 Christmas time for you really so 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.730
 for me, the forward number is on everyone 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.350
 I do not want to be very stressful 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.240
 absolutely because of christmas when you go for 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.530
 to get every present but 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.150
 because I always there so many exams 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 Write you probably know that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 that always close to Christmas 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.909
 written all important clauses 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 I will have only one on Wednesday 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.630
 four hours further but written 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.680
 which is now fortunately glory and now 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 I can be a bit more 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.230
 think about it and start the time 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.080
 to buy whole gifts 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.390
 what do you really want most? 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.090
 okay the answer is real now 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 stupid but this year I have even 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.630
 no direct request so something 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.880
 material is what i want to christmas 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.470
 wish except area so mini 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 trifles and what I mean 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.630
 My main wish is that mine 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.610
 Family and mainly my grandfather like that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.850
 have a very personal Christmas 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.190
 because that's totally important to me all 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.760
 everybody is together 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.050
 eat well and look forward to it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.670
 I'm actually the most me and me 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.470
 hope that will really cut it so 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.090
 and what I may wish for 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.600
 that I spend the evening with my cousin too 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.120
 say 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.960
 king of queens can watch and chips 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.970
 to eat 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.500
 Who is the most difficult for whom? 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.240
 to find a suitable gift 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.100
 I 'm always the hardest for 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.540
 to find my father's gift 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.850
 you are welcome in the comments 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 writing is with you too so is mine 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.260
 father is a passionate 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 pigeon fancier and that's why I want 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.680
 actually always give something in the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.450
 Field could fall for something with 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.770
 deaf 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.360
 It's not that easy because of me 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.040
 I do not know so well with it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.640
 and give him nothing wrong 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.250
 wants and no idea because you are so 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.900
 yes boring and do not eat 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.150
 if you have a great idea what 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.460
 you can give as a father writes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.760
 it below in the comments because so 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.740
 exactly I know honestly what had 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.230
 the worst thing you christmas everybody 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.390
 I have not gotten back yet 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.780
 I think so pretty nice 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.310
 but I just do not like it when people 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 Do not think about it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.140
 make or totally wrong 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.209
 assess that sometimes very 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.989
 pity I had last year too 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.100
 Christmas a blacksmith set for schmidt 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.380
 get beginners 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.680
 maybe I know well-intentioned 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.670
 because I like me but with 18 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.050
 one is no longer a beginner and then 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.700
 I could not learn so much with it 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.840
 but that does not mean totally 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.220
 bad because really know the thought 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.140
 therefore totally agree so what I have 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.480
 have not gotten yet how do you spend 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.489
 Christmas Eve is actually on us 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.370
 always tackle the same if you first 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.709
 in the church as eating something delicious ice 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.680
 there's turkey or whole and something delicious 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.510
 Dessert and think has each other 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.060
 the gifts and as I 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.910
 I said then my cousin 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.500
 and we women any sitcoms 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.470
 mostly king of queens and food 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.450
 any cool chips or cookies 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.090
 my art has its high remaining needs 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.370
 besides, that's pretty handy 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.890
 what do you think of a christmas in it? 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.570
 A warm long to travel would have 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.090
 I really, really bad if I christmas in 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.440
 I would have to spend another country 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.240
 do not just know because mine like that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.380
 is used to celebrating Christmas as 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.600
 partying 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.340
 and when you are in the warm country is there 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.720
 yes, no snow so that's with us 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.850
 not necessarily but that is yes 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.680
 not even cold so I think it's up 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.660
 definitely going to exciting and sometime 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.590
 I also have a different Christmas 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.440
 celebrate 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.090
 but so far I still enjoy that 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.130
 christmas what we celebrate at home 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.640
 you can because even a christmas carol 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.470
 or Christmas poem 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.220
 I think I can not poetry resin 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.680
 recite 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.720
 my parents have never been that way 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.030
 I should have said my very poem 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.830
 or so, for example, friend of mine learn the 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.600
 always lived many poems 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.740
 and then they told their parents 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 but somehow I never had to do that 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.360
 carols as I can so well 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.919
 farmers happy and michael bublÃ© 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.630
 I also like to sing in there 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.720
 Car with at the Christmas songs 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.550
 if that counts now real or 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.289
 a Christmas tree improperly 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.970
 we always have a real one 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.919
 fir tree as I think that belongs 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.030
 somehow to and with only spurious ones 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.580
 does not come so important 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.460
 christmas blessing of the prediction is there 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.680
 as a sacred snow, I think that's it 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.349
 There will be no snow on Christmas Eve 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.210
 I now know that part too 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.070
 Hope you liked the video 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.360
 if you have a few questions about my 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.010
 christmas you can do that 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.960
 like to write in the comments 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.210
 I like to answer that 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.020
 so to say, why christmas in detail 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.450
 spend 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.099

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.050
