00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.980
 Speak there, youtube talk show host. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 with you here or are you a channel scoundrel 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.050
 scoundrel tutorials 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.579
 today I come to bring a tutorial in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 karak different than I used to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.350
 to do there I recently had a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.890
 problem and how the reservoir of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 My gasoline, it's something and I 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 I think in this movie, a lot of people will have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.610
 this problem, right? 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.379
 is what happened to him not wanting tava 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.070
 more to getjar gasoline 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.140
 So I've been picking up here and dismantling a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 engine to know what it was 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.309
 really the right problem and I saw 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 also that a lot of people are having 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.290
 difficult to open this engine and is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.880
 very simple it is hidden but it is very 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.950
 simple 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:14.939
 as you can see here the open motor 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.890
 just right here so it's over to 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 who does not know what it's open for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 Up here, it comes really fair even you. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.119
 You have to push a knife right here or 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.180
 with patah pliers taking it out of here 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.299
 picking up and also one from a friend of mine and 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 which had already given problem, only the 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.320
 what happened to the engine 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.100
 He actually burned the engine he burned. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 is showing you motor here 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:51.869
 this is the right engine as it is inside 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.729
 here is the burning of course that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.950
 gives for you to enjoy and housing right 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.030
 here you can see that it's okay 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.540
 My language is here but right. 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.759
 coiled delic that gave problem that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.920
 burned right 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.069
 So this one will not pay, but I will. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.439
 waiting for him there 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.870
 future is changing the muse of this 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:19.090
 right problem 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.739
 I advise you to do the same too. 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.969
 there with that engine for whoever you want 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.230
 swapping right and the problem usually 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.519
 What do you even care? 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.739
 and it's very simple this is my 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.569
 It's true that I want to stay, I'm very 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.790
 time without using it and it was hard 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.799
 actually the engine 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.730
 I had to put that old one 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.950
 right chains passing on it and ready 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.949
 It worked fine again as if 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:54.219
 I was new ejecting and everything was fine then. 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:56.109
 for those who did not have it there is notion of how 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.939
 It's opening, do you know why this class here? 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.430
 For you, here today, how you're opening. 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.010
 here I've been talking to the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.989
 he thought he was armored, right. 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.549
 in fact it is not armored to you can 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.329
 see that it can be opened 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.500
 sure and if you are encountering this 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.879
 type of problem 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.109
 You may be solving this. 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.239
