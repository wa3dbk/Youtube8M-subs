00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.600
 if you like epic games 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.610
 history comparable to the mass effect of a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.580
 role component similar to skyrim 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.200
 the talisman is not quite your choice this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.179
 the game is made from another test 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 the game takes place on these and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 us the Slavic world where everything is mixed 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.539
 that we are well acquainted with early childhood 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.699
 as if the characters of all Russians 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 folk tales descended from the pages of books and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 settled down with us in the neighborhood 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 the game begins with what disappears 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 Kiev city and the main character to be 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 understand this phenomenon well and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.750
 incidentally return it to the place of the main 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.160
 heroes in game four is a warrior rogue 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.780
 healer and amazon 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 fundamental differences except 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.230
 there is no introductory video between them 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 truth at first vary and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 characteristics of the same warriors of power 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.530
 more than the robber however 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 time all smoothed pumping 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.399
 done in the good old traditions 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 elder scrolls that is, the longer we 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 do something the better it is with us 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.670
 comes out dividing from the onion swing agility 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 otdubit post fasting club force 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 the weapon has a property over time 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.549
 break down and not to lose 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.240
 favorite blade and you have to constantly 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.210
 to fix 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 and often very often average 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 the strength of the sword lasts for 15 minutes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.470
 travel however for arms 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.409
 magic comes and and divide by dark 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.900
 attacking and white healing or defensive 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 so if you broke a weapon to the city 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.390
 still stomping and stomping your favorite fireball 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390
 always with you 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.870
 in almost any locality 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.010
 will get the one he wants with you 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.080
 travel however such 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.060
 useless satellites i'm probably not 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.250
 I met not only that we could not 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.200
 set the battle style or watch them 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
 inventory and so they often love 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.490
 break into an enemy building through 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.950
 seconds 10 ingloriously die so they still 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.200
 on the way they manage to get the trees barely 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.330
 barely moving so that accounts for them 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.790
 constantly wait cities have something to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.369
 spend a specie in addition to weapons and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.220
 armor and trade artifacts giving 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.259
 any features or run fast 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
 or become a friend of any monster 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.369
 due to the small inventory accounted for 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:16.180
 constantly choose what to take with you 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.489
 and what to leave the life of the city â€‹â€‹in full swing 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.709
 stupid idlers who rush there 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.290
 here without a purpose get stuck in fences or 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.900
 barrels and even run out of the city where they 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.850
 and eat the good of all the monsters that you give 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.100
 or simply stand still play 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.320
 you can almost destroy everything 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.829
 no sense of it in the barrels for all 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.079
 canons 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.090
 games can anything and fall but from 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.459
 destroyed house or fence 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.440
 no through the ruined fence we are all 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.540
 Equally we can not pass and the master of the house 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.060
 won't even turn around if we tear it off 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 dwelling roof so if it robbing 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.860
 chest but the battle looks very even 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.320
 not bad monster scatter from strong 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.450
 blows or magic at robbers are cut 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.209
 the legs of the head or the arms are all quite 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.640
 cute and bloody to the hut clumsy 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.500
 creature quests standard basically 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.510
 are cleaning up the terrain from 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.709
 monsters though come across and quite 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.100
 interesting specimens 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.170
 but the dialogues pumped up no I'm not talking 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.150
 about the voice acting which is also not here 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.820
 the text is not bad here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.070
 make it problematic dialogue 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.620
 between the characters flashes in a second 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.239
 and remains in the text box and this window 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.400
 after a couple of seconds is filled 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.440
 other phrases of the same bushes or 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.810
 peasants and what we want to read 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.530
 floating off the horizon is very uncomfortable and 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.530
 annoying 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.030
 no matter what the game can find 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.280
 their fans really natural 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.740
 among our people it will not be them 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.780
 such amount as in the same prince before 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.210
 did the developers at least more 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.550
 convenient dialogue or control system 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.980
 the case of this game would go a lot better Only 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.320
 due to the fact that I really respect the Slavic 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.090
 the spirit I put where weak six 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.820
 although most players especially 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.710
 younger generation more than 5 points she is not 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.710
 will achieve or even only 4 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.820
 good luck to all of this and subscribe 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.820
 per channel
