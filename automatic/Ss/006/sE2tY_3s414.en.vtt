of<00:02:36.459> them<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.600> problem<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.079> this<00:02:38.230> is<00:02:38.290> a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
of them I think the problem is this is a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.819 
of them I think the problem is this is a
known<00:02:38.799> issue<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:40.030> East<00:02:40.209> we<00:02:40.450> were<00:02:40.829> reliable

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
known issue the East we were reliable

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.190 
known issue the East we were reliable
but<00:02:42.010> they<00:02:42.850> must<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.209> switched<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.170> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
but they must have switched to a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.020 
but they must have switched to a
different<00:02:44.370> manufacturer<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.430> something<00:02:45.820> but

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
different manufacturer or something but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.150 
different manufacturer or something but
something<00:02:47.019> happened<00:02:47.440> where<00:02:47.590> these<00:02:47.799> started

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
something happened where these started

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.789 
something happened where these started
to<00:02:48.340> be<00:02:48.519> flaky<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.810> think<00:02:50.380> they<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.530> said<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
to be flaky so I think they just said it

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.460 
to be flaky so I think they just said it
