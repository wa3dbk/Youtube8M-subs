00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.020
 Hello, I want to be with you today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.120
 share a wonderful recipe 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.920
 wonderful and masks since this mask 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 super cheap super efficient and i 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 I think you will like the result I think 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
 many have not tried those who have not tried 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 whom oily skin i recommend 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 try this mask because after 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 her skin is smooth skin tender in general to me 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.320
 I like the result and this morning I 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.079
 I will make this mask and I really liked 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.989
 and for a long time and and did not do it because 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 that if I start making this mask, then I 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.180
 I start doing every day and skin only 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 do not spoil do not need to do 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.399
 maximum once a week and then the result 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 will be just awesome 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.879
 Often you can not do it to someone once 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 week someone can even once a month 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 it depends on what kind of skin you have for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 oily skin can often do but 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.930
 don't get carried away like i usually 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
 I do it because at first I really 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 like the result and i start doing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.560
 they do it but they can't do it 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.259
 because the skin is dried in order 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.900
 that the skin was smooth and soft need 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.900
 do not very often and what for this 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.909
 you just need to have 100 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 and some water half a teaspoon of soda 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.070
 We take a little put on a hand pour 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.100
 some water just a little bit and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.689
 we start to put it all on face 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.799
 should make such a mushy 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.240
 weight 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.149
 and all this must be applied to the face and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 leave for about 10 minutes to dry 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.030
 when the soda will be showered from the face 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.230
 then it is necessary to wash away and not easy 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.540
 wash it well 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.770
 affect the skin as with 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.000
 scrub a little hurt face very 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.900
 good soda cleanses the skin very 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.270
 well it acts like a scrub and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.840
 works even better than scrub very 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.690
 cleans well and sense it with some water and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.760
 then apply a moisturizer or 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.580
 moisturizing mask then the result will be 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.960
 even better because if not nasty skin 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.030
 will be too dry 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.320
 and so the skin will be smooth and smooth but 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.490
 the only thing that skin will be a little bit 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.960
 reddish and so this mask is better 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.560
 do for the night 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.360
 then in the morning the mask will disappear and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.260
 skin will only smoothly and smoothly 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.870
 I still want to say that if someone 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.380
 there are strong pimples that probably too 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.830
 it's better not to do it because you grieve 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.160
 face with acne is not very good and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.560
 process time during application mask 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.459
 will tweak a little and during that 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.290
 how will you have a mask on your face 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.750
 but it's okay so it should be 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.770
 maybe there are some small 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.170
 wounds on the face that should not be visible but 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.530
 they are and in general they will be many 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.600
 pinch but it's okay to garden it 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
 great antiseptic possible after 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.980
 you won't have fewer pimples on your face 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.730
 appear wishing everyone good beautiful 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.730
 skin healthy skin all bye bye
