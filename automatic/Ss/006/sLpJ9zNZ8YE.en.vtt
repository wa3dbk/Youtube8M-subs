00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.979
 with all I am but a stranger to show today thereby 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.919
 made use of who is one of the best medicine 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.050
 and then I don't want to start with a first one 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.810
 I have arcelor steel group with the testers 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 three different and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.669
 spain is cut 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.489
 these are the pier are both of the dike if you can view your collection 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.110
 and Parkinson's and as you can see it has nothing to do with the kids 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.780
 to make 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.770
 that's nice of a shit it's always a block of 30 by 30 centimeters 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.330
 30 open 30 outlets with actually scrabble format 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.130
 You can see that it also makes good use for the card 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.250
 and I did that I have taken these 3 and forms that this week is on 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.440
 each other 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.479
 they are and will only be met and then and no collisions 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.920
 we start with the largest 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.620
 and I give that time to them with and that for example with a ruler 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.340
 and put a line in a pencil 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.340
 And going to do that cut out is not going wrong 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.450
 The intention is hard that you have some sort of pouch 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 makes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 where you can write 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 I can put it aside This is done 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 then we take parts 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.470
 people inside that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 slightly smaller is that crazier the alps 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 in the campaign to be conversion 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 9 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 I have this on top 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 and shares that card it is bid 10 by 15 card 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 temporary pieces of paper 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.010
 it is also a big file from that collection of dijk 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.980
 and I cut it on the nine men or at 12 centimeters 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.590
 m because I do not quite fit this gesture actually always the leftovers 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.719
 of paper 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.799
 I have decided that I rarely want to use the blue, but also a little 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.759
 to do work 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.830
 so i did i got something 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.199
 large cut that laid exactly on top of each other 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.920
 and stuck and that's why people have the ep 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 set extra so that you know for sure if it will stay in place 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 in between it comes immediately on top of the map 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.689
 the first 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.049
 the nests buttocks to see the pouch stick to be open that we animals 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.769
 can be disappointing for 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.639
 and then I only draw 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.389
 the outdoor fires 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.389
 otherwise you can't put anything in it with this 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.989
 not even at the top 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.989
 because then nothing can go in 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.829
 and they just stick 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.039
 on the map 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.039
 the side the boil double-sided tape users 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:04.489
 the sqaure 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.389
 as long as you make sure that it is not too much to eat, because otherwise you can 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.429
 later 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:10.799
 you can no longer register there 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.459
 and to finish this piece 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.709
 take a ribbon I always like the restriction on the set on the tm 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.509
 such a 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.509
 through 8 we don't take a piece 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.589
 registered bags 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.799
 what do you think 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 the keeper 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.929
 the army just such a beautiful 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.789
 around the map 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.189
 and in tree 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 I succeed because I had the man 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:46.749
 comes to a piece of 82 newspaper 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.439
 a piece of work for the other side 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.009
 to clear the board 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.449
 Map 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 I can be that too 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.099
 that has my feeling 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.749
 but it will be alright 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.079
 this is just a very nice card to give money for example 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.050
 it looked like a gift voucher 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.050
 you come here 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.960
 good 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.120
 they understood 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.460
 so just a piece of the ribbon 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.460
 certainly below 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.559
 we make a knot 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.749
 I think I have my 2 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.159
 you want 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.090
 the Rhine an army 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.090
 the side nice lead 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.559
 in the company 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.589
 and i got you 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:08.069
 browns anp 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.069
 why and to finish it off completely 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.250
 I have a very nice crochet that you can just be ready 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.199
 to buy 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.879
 I also had to make it myself if you're good at it 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.110
 but i'm still open to it easier 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.979
 I just wanted to buy 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.979
 on the backside 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.689
 we can here 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.689
 in the middle 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.349
 and then your cards are ready 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.669
 you can write another message about it with a revised one 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.860
 sticker now needs a sticker 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.349
 m on a stamp that is completely what you want 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.259
 good luck and see you next time 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:54.819
 yet
