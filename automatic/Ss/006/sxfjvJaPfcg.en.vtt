00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:08.640
 Tired of spending towers and cotton towers and not getting rid of nail polish? 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:18.599
 Do you rub and rub and you do not achieve your goal? Today I'm going to show you how you can do 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.029
 a nail remover that does not use cotton, which is super easy to use 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.200
 and that also removes everything to the edges of the nail painting. Do not move that I already show you 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.089
 I personally find it super boring to go to the hairdresser to get 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.949
 the manicure I'm one of those ... More boring still make me ... But more boring 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:08.480
 I still have to remove the enamel. That process of having to grab your cotton, 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.510
 go off and go for the fourth, fifth cotton on a nail and still not 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.300
 you go out and do not leave the bordecitos seems unbearable. 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.040
 We're going to need a sponge ... In this case I've got a car sponge that's enough 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.900
 great, but you could also get for example dish washing sponges and 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.110
 suddenly they are piling up. We also need a little jar that can be made of plastic 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.630
 or glass, it does not matter if it's square or round, but it's obviously empty; a marker 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:06.150
 or down; A blade also serves a scissors and acetone. We put the container of 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.750
 glass on the sponge, with the marker we will mark the shape of the pot on the sponge 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 to then be able to cut. Now I grab my blade and I'm going to cut the sponge the way I 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.630
 I have marked, it does not matter that we are not perfect, the thing is that it has the approximate form. 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:49.580
 He's staying like a little man, now I'm going to behead him. Now I'm going to make a hole 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.840
 in the center of my sponge that is going to be the place where I'm going to put the finger of which 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.530
 I want to remove the enamel. In this case I'm going to make a cross, that way it's me 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.840
 easier. I completely cross the sponge with the blade or scissors. I'm going to put the sponge 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:28.069
 inside my little jar. How it looks inside ... It is a golaso ​​and a super solution this implement. 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:36.670
 Now we put the acetone into the jar, fill it roughly halfway. This 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.099
 it will be useful for several applications just in case, it is not that they have to be spending 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:49.700
 acetone in each application. Now you see: some little waves inside the sponge and the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.230
 impeccable finger This device, as I say, can be used for several applications, 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.510
 that is, they finish getting rid of their nails, they just put their lid on it and they keep it, and they go 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.780
 to serve for a lot of used. It's not like they have to be changing acetone 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.770
 every time. Well girls, I hope you liked this tip, I swear to you that 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:18.159
 When I discovered it I loved it, to me sincerely it solved my life, now I have my little pot 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:24.020
 in the wallet and when I have an accident with the nails, then I take out the enamel immediately 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.430
 Without further ado, I no longer find it so cumbersome to do it and nothing, so please
