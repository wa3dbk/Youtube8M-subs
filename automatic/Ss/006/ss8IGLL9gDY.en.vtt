00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello guys Himmelsdorf card 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 I'm on the tank 352 really love this card on 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.630
 this tank and saw this map when 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.390
 it would seem that they were immediately thought that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.760
 Now I will just hire why I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 I record this video because I saw 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
 on YouTube once the video is called 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.080
 how does a girl of 3 play 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.599
 who doesn't video look not really 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.840
 everybody plays like that I saw girls 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:42.840
 play many well I want you now 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:46.289
 show it a little soon here I go 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 the mountain to highlight us tanks 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.629
 it is natural not to miss them further 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:02.370
 I found no food I decide to do 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.320
 I see the second round pt and now I run away 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.250
 I think that you need to drive illuminate 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.930
 middle 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 I see that the tiger is all alone 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:19.590
 hiding behind a banana don't need them somehow 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 help here what's right there 02 what 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.850
 very very sad 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.040
 I need to be highlighted here 20 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.869
 run away from shelling I run away and run into 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.810
 the middle, I see that no one 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:45.630
 obstruct here naturally 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:49.679
 I break through fifty armor-piercing 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:55.079
 shells I'm going to help the game now 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:02:00.470
 because he is one and we build and here 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.470
 I shoot from the ass 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.830
 then I notice th i'm trying to escape 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.830
 bad luck 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.959
 from not such a skill that 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:35.070
 just rubs on i can't run away 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:37.739
 Easy, the more he not top and think 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.359
 that Iâ€™m not going to hurt them anymore 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:46.769
 ran away but no, I helped the tiger further 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:53.310
 because he is one and shoot at ISU 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:58.400
 and it became so that I had time 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.920
 accelerated and run away there is finishing 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.190
 just finishing up hiding behind a typewriter 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.370
 because seeing that player is not very 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.850
 good what can he just her 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.850

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.190
 all the same all the same you need to help out 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:24.020
 tiger because 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:37.550
 coming down from the mountain he will eat a hundred 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:44.630
 just and nakidaet i help tiger not 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:47.000
 just pick him up and see how she would 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.730
 Art therefore on her roads especially not 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:00.230
 it was necessary for her and just now food and 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:04:03.830

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.030
 to you stock not production he stukov 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:14.480
 it would be more trouble typing sauce 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:28.040
 and just goes miserable entanglement 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:29.810
 until one of these do not pay on the skin 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.170
 which is mounted on tanks decided 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:36.770

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.850
 Kunay arranged basically everyone knows 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.920
