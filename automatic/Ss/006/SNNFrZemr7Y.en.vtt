00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.809
 hello I introduced you the range bobl 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.190
 2012 2013 so this year at that we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.390
 therefore provides a place of brother 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.949
 range of our products in quotation marks 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.619
 freeski track that produces the most track 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 until the fat freeride products so 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.400
 this year we renew the model the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.420
 do it so it's a model that renews 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.949
 body learns the last the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.080
 particularity of this script so it's a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 produced at 77 on a skate on a radius of 13 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 m what we added on there of 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.910
 big differences that happens at 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 movement since the last one is we 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.300
 put a double titanium blade so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.770
 really to go in quotation marks 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 in a little bit more 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 performance one is always in the idea 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.579
 freeski world has a little bit more in 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 the performance is why we have 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.059
 reinforced in the small anna then we have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.040
 the wave that is new so 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.200
 always in the direction of going a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.450
 little more to the performance or also the one 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.100
 geometry that depends on our guts so 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.750
 in doubles at the little year also 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 okay so on a geometry 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 we are on the 4th group reached 15 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.339
 radius meters so program 70% track 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.109
 the model type so you talked about it all 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.049
 at the appointed time so here we go 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.639
 the 80 to the skate 15 meters radius 70% 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.009
 track against you there we keep our 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.240
 wood construction three wood species 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.499
 our work in being the famous lake there 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.299
 really still under foot 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:21.569
 guys from the relatively lightweight enrollees 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.469
 what is really in quotation marks lax 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.259
 movement 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.310
 this year we have the jam so we look 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.849
 really the same geometry in the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 lucky 85 to skate 136 in spatula the 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:32.320
 17 meters radius 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.300
 so between guiding 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.400
 our strict has against what we have 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.440
 changed on this ski this year it was 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.150
 added the rocker vultures give 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.350
 even more this versatility especially 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.780
 to come out a better reading of 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.220
 ground of agreement and then came all 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.860
 rocker's arguments an ease in 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.660
 curve input so that's the jam so 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.490
 big wait on this product 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.380
 I have my wife so we find the prism 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.210
 so has its variations of the model the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.770
 do so we come back on double in 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 titanium for women so a ski that 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.759
 relatively are positioned high of 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.039
 range the 13 m radius with 77 on the skate 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.450
 we are going to shift so on the hundred so the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.000
 hundred years old women are it's a 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.480
 renewal of the same this kit the year 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.350
 last one okay and then the gloss 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.730
 so exactly the same this kit the year 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040
 last which is a declination of the zip 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.780
 large women's models the 84 1 15 m of 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.739
 ray believe that they always have me at home 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.850
 women on the gloss of the pilos is the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.100
 weight it's really a real argument 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.530
 with us so here is facilitate 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.989
 accessibility very player side of home 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.660
 bigmat the freeski we find gones haut 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.190
 adventure range so we will find 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.739
 the last blaster who had a big 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.360
 success so the interest of this ski is the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.030
 even I master the last one we have the 86 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.980
 to skate with a really tired 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.269
 progressive and big interest of this which 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.070
 fits that makes 1 kg 5 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.870
 not really in the spirit adventure 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.010
 I did that mountain skiing to ride 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.959
 either in track sound on a hike on a 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.700
 telemark big success at home year 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.110
 last one so we reconduit 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.769
 and then the declination a woman model 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.769
 which is called doing it 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.500
 so we continue on the source at the famous 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.260
 sources so always renewed even 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.959
 geometry 94 and reaches a radius 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.129
 relatively current 17 meters radius 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.439
 we find our famous spatula 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.120
 progressive so that's it's a ski 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.470
 such a case a big success by his 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.870
 versatility it can be other that puts 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.430
 skiing every day with insolence a 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.900
 little bit more free ride but once 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.579
 of more arguments very light so 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.859
 facilitating trigger in pivoting 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.629
 do not ski I many physical 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.069
 gauge and who will still dig well 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.549
 surprise because of its short radius 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.739
 the tattoo the little sister in a woman so 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.680
 we are in the source model 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.180
 but for women so as I say 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.109
 that's a lot of fun for women that the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.760
 makes his weight once again 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.239
 really ease and others for a 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.329
 release 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.459
 we continue our freestyle craft so 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.139
 we always find the helloco bike 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.100
 we really did not change anything to be what 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.140
 that they were freestyle okay 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.330
 and then the mosquito which has very 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.760
 worked well this year including 94 at 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.220
 skate we are on double rocker before 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.440
 back and then in the idea so a 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.810
 very short radius so that ski kaka 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.610
 really more in his versatility 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.590
 the idea backcountry a crystal 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.030
 backcountry and then we ski on track which 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.090
 will still be catchy and well 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.790
 good power because the group does not have 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.079
 changed we are really in the spirit 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:25.550
 backcountry very pretty this year 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:29.070
 renewed our famous slice engine 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.750
 that's geometry not much to 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.480
 to say we can see the beastly beast monster 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.970
 it works by itself to finish 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.940
 other really freeride cases that's going 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.610
 novelty this year one finds the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.930
 buzz pattern okay fits that comes 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.680
 in the course of the range a little bit 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.070
 above the source 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.840
 so we find 99 mm in the chord 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.430
 with flat heels and who is going to be 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.440
 relatively pigeon so I'm going to have 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.120
 a very good performance and then here we are 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.440
 go to the rocker so there really the 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.390
 long spatula that will allow for good 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.820
 judges and it is of course declines 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.360
 declined for women who will be called 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.360
 the beautiful book 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.140
 that's just 99 of which one skate 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.640
 as explained was always 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.650
 the weight argument at home a skiff 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.360
 and especially nike to ride with the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.660
 cops probably to finish with the 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.640
 women 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.129
 this year the super turbo 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.089
 to the woman model here 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.759
 when we start to really be in 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.770
 of the very wide out of 15 to skates despite 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.529
 everything accessible we find a very 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.789
 pretty trust ok that was the year 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.589
 last the replacement of the goliath 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.089
 we went on should be shorter 22 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.009
 radius meters a long spatula and 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:33.179
 progressive since really i would say 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.469
 in quotation marks our most 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:36.659
 athletic if I can tell from our diam 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.699
 freeride a very present and red heel 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.399
 so registered relatively safe sportsman has 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.339
 taken away to finish so here's the 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:48.239
 super turbo family so there the big the 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:51.269
 machine or 115 mm waist 192 and 125 in 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:53.689
 will not restore to the bottom mans 2 0 

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.689
 jo but free 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.680
 this is our baby
