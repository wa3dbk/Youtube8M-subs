 up to 300 watts consumed by 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.190
 the power supply is the fan 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.350
 do not fall so we basically have a power supply 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 passive from 0 to 300 watts and that becomes 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.329
 active from 300 to 750 watts 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.829

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.059

 corsair when we receive them produce and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.629

 block in itself on the kills so we see 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.229
 the part that will be visible once 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.619
 with the technical features we 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.780
 so go to linger a few moments 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.740
 to tell you that we have 1 3 volts 3 of 25 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 father 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.260
 5 volts of 25 years also toil and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.980
 a 62-volt 12-volt rail loses enemy 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.840
 all for 750 watts on the 12 volts 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.280
 on the sides we see it we have 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.080
 hx 750i stickers blue and white very 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 very classic clean 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.720
 at the back we go to the gate 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.390
 Power with honeycomb design 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.460
 we have a small hx 750 sticker and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.980
 once again the device for the 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.320
 power cord and switch 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.700
 if we return the power supply on 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.860
 will first look at the part with 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.650
 the additional connectors finally the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 connectors for removable cables from 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 this diet 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.930
 you have to know that the diet is 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.880
 fully modular ie 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.070
 even the 24 pin or lupine cpu are 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.110
 separated from the food here we see on 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.050
 has the devices for Corsican airlink 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.730
 the fan test so that will help to know 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.500
 if the fan still works if 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.180
 you use too much power our 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.680
 passive for example and then we have so 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.410
 all the connectors that are well 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.990
 information on the top we see we have 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 a fine grid so that's the most 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.580
 more often adopted now 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.470
 already had this type of gray on the rm on 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.840
 has a cage that is rather working 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.950
 in its forms with rather pretty screws 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.160
 and below there is a fan 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.470
 of 135 mm fan of 135 mm which 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.120
 can operate in passive mode 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.090
 earth it's not going to fire if 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.540
 you are under 300 watts of load 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.420
 so that was the x ax at 756 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.280
 was on cowcotland sure that code tv on 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.690
 will offer you the complete test of this 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.250
 feeding very soon on 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.280
 cowcotland.com and you are told to very 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.280
 soon
