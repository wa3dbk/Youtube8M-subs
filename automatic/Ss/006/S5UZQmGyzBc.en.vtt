cartridge on top the amazing it's our
brain<00:01:10.899> this<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:11.619> our<00:01:11.890> grain<00:01:12.130> turn

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
brain this is our grain turn

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.670 
brain this is our grain turn
so<00:01:15.039> in<00:01:15.340> spot<00:01:15.880> for<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.450> spinal<00:01:16.840> cord<00:01:17.200> above

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
so in spot for the spinal cord above
