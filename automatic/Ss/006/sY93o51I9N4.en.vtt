00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 a simple hug or handshake may 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.000
 create embarrassment for those who suffer from 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.940
 hyperhidrosis or excessive production 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 of sweating arise difficulties in socializing 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.310
 social and professional 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.640
 hyperhidrosis mainly affects the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 armpit to the palm of the hands and the soles of the feet 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.640
 but can also affect the face 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.450
 scalp and other regions of the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 body 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.129
 Let's now know what the causes are. 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.129
 of this dysfunction of the organism 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 It is believed that the majority of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.820
 Excessive sweating is caused by 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.550
 by genetic predisposition individuals 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.190
 who suffer from excessive sweating usually 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.710
 sound up to five times more than the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.730
 normal disrupting your activities 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.980
 daily 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.640
 hyperhidrosis can also be caused 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.070
 by emotional stimuli and even by a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.870
 imbalance of the regulatory centers of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.110
 body temperature 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.770
 however, it can not yet be stated with 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.350
 certainty because pedrosa triggered the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.470
 non-surgical option for treatment of 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.869
 stone is the application of a 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.920
 called botulinum toxin 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.920
 Let's meet her. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.320
 the discovery for more than a century has been 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.539
 being used since the 80's 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.030
 is a protein complex of origin 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.250
 is widely used for 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 treatment and prevention of wrinkles 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.479
 dynamics but few know that it 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 is also very effective in treating 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.990
 excessive sweating 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.049
 the procedure is performed without 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.189
 hospitalization in the office environment 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.140
 doctor 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.509
 this is possible because the glands 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.119
 sweat sweat when in release 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.119
 contact with a substance called 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 acetylcholine 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.620
 botulinum toxin prevents the release 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.360
 of this substance and consequently the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.360
 sweat production is reduced 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.810
 after application the patient may 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.050
 return to normal activities in the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.360
 same day in most cases this type 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.910
 treatment is not definitive but 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.550
 reapplications can be made 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.890
 always talk to your doctor he will do 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.540
 an individual and detailed assessment 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.540
 indicating the best treatment
