00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:16.860
 Snap fit is used as a fastening means in resin part design 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:22.050
 In the case of simple shape , you can check the strength by desk calculation 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.540
 Confirm strength in complex shapes using solidworks simulation 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.570
 Is possible 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.160
 Snap fit 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:37.310
 Need to push the claws off during installation 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:46.090
 Make sure the amount of overlap in the mounted state of the snap fit for the calculation 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:46.090
 You can use the prompting function to measure the required place on the 3D assembly 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:02.430
 Solidworks simulation for designers is easy to use 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 The command is also arranged according to the work procedure 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:12.890
 Also, many material libraries are available. 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.890
 It is not necessary to check physical properties every time in the catalog 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:27.409
 Unlike desk calculations, you can intuitively specify the conditions for the actual shape of the 3 ground silver 9 items. 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.409
 You can proceed with building calculation preparation from the calculator 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:37.670
 As you see the conditions 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:40.570
 Also performs other members and information sharing, such as design review at the will be visualized on model 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.570
 You can 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 We are ready to calculate the strength at the tip of the nail, suggesting a push-off during installation 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.020
 All calculations complete with one click 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.450
 Calculation results such as stress and mutation are walked down x, so it can be evaluated efficiently in the whole part 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.450
 I will 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.230
 The calculation on the desk can not calculate some mutations of the needle 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.260
 Check the entire a tree in color display in solidworks simulation 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.659
 I can do it 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.659
 It is possible further to save the three-dimensional shape after deformation to use 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:41.849
 Hmm 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.849
 Check snap fit and claw deformation without assembly 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:51.670
 The deformed shape can be displayed at any time 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.670
 We can consider confirmation item in measure beforehand 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
 Hmm 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:13.890
 It is also important that the snap fit does not come off after installation 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.890
 Make sure that it does not come off if it is under the neck of the nail 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.530
 Hmm 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.530
 As a result of calculation, it was confirmed that the amount of deformation was small 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.260
 dee 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.549
 It displays the deformed shape of the nail on the pre-not 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.400
 The amount of over lamp was secured and it was confirmed that the parts did not come off
