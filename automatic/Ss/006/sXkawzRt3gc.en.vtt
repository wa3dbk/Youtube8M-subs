00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.100
 always on Sundays it goes to around 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.020
 the rope road when the youth player 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.330
 in a red and white jersey run up and 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.430
 Parents and diehard fans at the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.350
 it's exactly the same with the page line 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.440
 at the first team at goal points 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.910
 and often rivalries but that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.840
 not only happens on one of the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.940
 four places instead 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.940
 even apart from there is a lot to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.380
 Doing besides the sponsors are committed 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.090
 many helping hands especially 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.890
 honorary we youth obmann 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.020
 harald brÃ¼ndermann can tell 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.390
 it all stands and falls with this 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.089
 new we have partial people the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.879
 have their own company they strive 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.699
 Here are the u17 area which are in the u19 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.430
 area and work here as if obsessed 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.409
 around the teams right 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.720
 auszustaffieren who are really there 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.409
 the discipline is the cause of the worries 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.300
 with the trainers reasonably correct 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.090
 work up professionally and if that 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 It would not be the helper and also 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.530
 not to lift here 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 and who knows if you are in our u12 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 maybe from the next mÃ¶lders 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.550
 stoppelkamp or ozil at the start of his 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.440
 can watch career are encountered 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.360
 breimann zwiesel but not only on the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.880
 offspring but also on former 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.660
 players today for the club 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.940
 are active 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.830
 the red-white youth work but still out 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.740
 previous times and personal experience 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.920
 knows there are already some years as 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.390
 In 1972, even more than that in the youth and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.050
 I do not believe that at all 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.450
 compare more 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.759
 really done so much just what that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.490
 education and if you are in the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.610
 reason with the house of our time 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.390
 compare everything wrong in the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 today's time 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.200
 from that I think that the boys already 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.440
 really a really great education 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 enjoy here with us and yes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.190
 Of course, also looks at the s.der 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.980
 development of the individual players yes that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.240
 is ultimately something to bring 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.740
 and 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.170
 are always excited if you have such a 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.150
 development of our players the and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.690
 that 's why I think we' re standing on the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 right way 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 and that this is the right way 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.600
 you do not just look at the current one 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.430
 results of youth teams 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.580
 but also at the general 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.580
 development 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.310
 which in other junior departments only 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.590
 is available for a team 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.210
 Must go to three mans meadow though for all 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.550
 But teams are enough for motivation 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.710
 teamwork and above all the good mood 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.140
 can not be compensated so much 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.480
 always in the summer road is actually 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.460
 always good if you have a good topic here 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.050
 all functional themes speak all 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.540
 trainer careers athletics trainer 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.970
 Physiotherapists understand themselves relatively 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.010
 good as a team also as a 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.780
 that we as the whole 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.790
 junior department work together 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.840
 currently the mood is over 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.970
 a bit better 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.090
 both our little ones and boys 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.960
 We enjoy ourselves so much 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.850
 also our ours 17 and 19 16 15 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.760
 who are really in the league like that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.680
 we imagine that so we big 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.350
 hope that in the end person too 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.070
 that we through the beautiful graduation 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.070
 can do 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.530
 and if the u19 is the highest 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 age group continues to do so well 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.520
 This should be nothing in the beats 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.140
 if there is not the bland way 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.150
 tasteschmack that would be the 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.920
 high-class competition clubs out 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.350
 the region's eyes are young 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.970
 keep talents open and enjoy themselves 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.100
 the outstanding red and white 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.450
 junior work serve what also the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.420
 regular visitors to the 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.810
 sunny on waves especially at 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.270
 The A youth who currently have 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.340
 scary good players 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.190
 where I am firmly convinced that the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.859
 sometimes in the first team 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.060
 occur unless they will be back 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.790
 taken away from the well-known clubs in the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.830
 for yourself 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.780
 Anyway, some faces are off 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.040
 The b youth should definitely be 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.890
 sometimes more 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.830
 and if the goal is to breilmanns meadow 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.520
 a dfb the censored 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.380
 to realize a young talent center 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.000
 is reached it is the club 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.650
 Much easier are the boys 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.290
 Talents also in the long term to the club 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.650
 tie and get into the first team too 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.650
 integrate
