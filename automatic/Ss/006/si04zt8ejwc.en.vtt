00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 it's nice to do some believe it 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 you can tell you that if I'm fit 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.679
 martine like 45 meters takes a turn and a hundred 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.640
 once a week with him more the same 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.669
 a sport of precision 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.539
 which allows these people with disabilities to go beyond 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 to develop all their motives 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
 climbing is learning to move safely 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.420
 in a random environment like a daily boil 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.500
 it's since 1992 the mystery has not been put in place 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.650
 very few are the companies that m 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.310
 that's why I'm blowing 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.740
 adapted sport 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.070
 for this audience 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 sports disciplines 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.660
 trim 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.140
 table tennis until monday 6 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.650
 for which certain rules 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 changed tonight you are who 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 it's choosing our commitment 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330
 we are not in the rhythm of this increase 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 less than a year ago 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.220
 alain burlot 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.370
 climbing 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.440
 in the end did he warn 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.840
 ducati and therapeutic 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 in a poor country and draws its natural wealth 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.200
 a train can naturally 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.870
 it is a very big disarray 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.750
 we try to find gestures 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.610
 for the person with a disability or a year 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.990
 The principle is the same 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 it is first the pleasure the game 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840
 then after that becomes something 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.280
 duration or even there are rules to respect 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.010
 it can be 6% 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.700
 therapy 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.640
 in one direction or another place 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 situations to manage a stress to manage 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.760
 yes it can be too 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.960
 it is imitated from rehabilitation 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 for people with severe disabilities or 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.789
 the French 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.299
 it's already a little wait 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 and it's the people 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:35.559
 in a sports practice without him 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.519
 no security 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.519
 accompanied 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.919
 trained staff 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.299
 knowing the handicap situation 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.179
 victory 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.179
 exercise 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:03.709
 and complications 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.869
 about the report to the goal then otherwise to us then 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.869
 see us every four years because currently the championships of France 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.359
 with a record of 6-0 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.219
 the hardest in the world 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.599
 curriculum vitae 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.319
 the championship am not a girl from east of england are the godmothers 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 of the competition 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.209
 so 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
 this is a country like china and india 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.359
 but even more 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.659
 drawing on his demonstrations of perseverance and courage 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.069
 but also to respect 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 ericsson who mental and brave who puts a lot of 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.439
 m apparently we leave the competition i think i have 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.439
 a lot to learn is the north of haiti 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.359
 the competition 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.810
 gold for us go out on site in turin while we also meet 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.680
 climbers 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.090
 and so good 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.090
 handball when you realize that it's a great player who does not loose anything 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.889
 who recognizes on the ground and more beautiful the communication between them the people in 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.889
 handicap situation and climbers can exceed 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.090
 he uses the material 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.680
 but even if he hopes with this dish 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.409
 there is a commitment 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:42.710
 and then I would say 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 I'm only 21 years old 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.559
 both actors 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.409
 francis pejean 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.620
 to practice 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.210
 we are here 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.020
 everything works 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.979
 first 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.509
 to go to sport 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.509
 exercise 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.550
 the desjardins boom 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.889
 except for these national meetings, however, the opportunity to tighten 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.879
 more 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:36.879
 nothing 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.449
 there is the wake of more and more a trend that is developing 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.050
 tie drops in the eyes among clubs 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.050
 of adapted sport is to go to the mountains to prepare young people 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.650
 physically and take them to mountain and high mountain 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.099
 mountaineering 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.309
 here are some experiences and many years and many quests 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:21.570
 they were made 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.969
 it's the first 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.089
 the Federation 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:27.150
 all the unions 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.020
 37 million 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.069
 licensee 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.569
 and in front 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.599
 he will go to a federation of 48 10
