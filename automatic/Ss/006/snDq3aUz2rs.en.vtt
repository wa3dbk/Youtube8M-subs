of permanent makeup is a lid percy lip

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.209 
of permanent makeup is a lid percy lip
liner<00:00:31.790> we<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> shade<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.719> lip<00:00:33.930> liner<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.530> we

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.720 
liner we do a shade of lip liner and we
do<00:00:35.460> full<00:00:36.090> lip<00:00:36.570> pigmentation<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.460> being

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
do full lip pigmentation now that being

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.530 
do full lip pigmentation now that being
said<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:40.040> not<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.070> easy<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.030> job<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
said it is not that easy of a job to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330 
said it is not that easy of a job to
really<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.110> pigment<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> lips<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
really get that pigment in the lips and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.639 
really get that pigment in the lips and
the<00:00:44.610> reason<00:00:44.940> being<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.170> lip<00:00:46.379> tissue

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the reason being is that the lip tissue

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
the reason being is that the lip tissue
is<00:00:47.010> very<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.460> different<00:00:47.789> than<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.149> facial

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
is very very different than your facial

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
is very very different than your facial
tissue<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.230> especially<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.770> tissue<00:00:49.980> i'm<00:00:50.219> on

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
tissue and especially the tissue i'm on

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.410 
tissue and especially the tissue i'm on
the<00:00:50.910> eyebrow<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> eyeliner<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:54.180> lips

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the eyebrow and the eyeliner the lips

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
the eyebrow and the eyeliner the lips
are<00:00:54.710> particularly<00:00:55.710> difficult<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.399> lips

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
are particularly difficult because lips

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.750 
are particularly difficult because lips
are<00:00:57.149> an<00:00:57.360> actual<00:00:57.870> muscle<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.520> really

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
are an actual muscle so you're really

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
are an actual muscle so you're really
having<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.270> drive<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.960> pigment<00:01:01.530> into<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
having to drive that pigment into the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.690 
having to drive that pigment into the
lip<00:01:02.340> let<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> heal<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.400> then<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:05.670> back

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
lip let it heal over and then come back

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.800 
lip let it heal over and then come back
in<00:01:06.180> four<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.570> six<00:01:06.600> weeks<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> again<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
in four to six weeks we do it again and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
in four to six weeks we do it again and
sometimes<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:09.960> even<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> third<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.130> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
sometimes we even do it a third time to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
sometimes we even do it a third time to
really<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> pigment<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> lips<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
really get the pigment in the lips the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.070 
really get the pigment in the lips the
problem<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.030> lip<00:01:15.210> procedure<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.900> there

problem with the lip procedure if there

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
problem with the lip procedure if there
is<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> problem<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> trade-off<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
is a problem I think the trade-off is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
is a problem I think the trade-off is
pretty<00:01:18.540> fantastic<00:01:18.799> since<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.130> to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.600 
and you've got your undertone your
overtone<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.789> how<00:02:09.629> tan<00:02:09.959> are<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.349> that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
belies what your undertone is so let's

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.390 
belies what your undertone is so let's
say<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.580> are<00:02:15.180> Italian<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.860> Greek<00:02:17.160> you

are Spanish you are East Indian you are
african-american<00:02:21.590> all<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:23.010> these<00:02:23.250> skin<00:02:23.670> tones

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
african-american all of these skin tones

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.080 
african-american all of these skin tones
are<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.810> always<00:02:25.140> desirable<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.430> permanent

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
are not always desirable for permanent

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.750 
are not always desirable for permanent
lip<00:02:27.660> liner<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> reason<00:02:29.100> that<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.220> say<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
lip liner and the reason that I say that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
lip liner and the reason that I say that
is<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> really<00:02:30.750> look<00:02:30.990> at<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
is because if you really look at the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.900 
is because if you really look at the
center<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.890> your<00:02:32.010> lip<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:34.650> you're<00:02:35.490> going<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
center of your lip here you're going to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.600 
center of your lip here you're going to
find<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.540> some<00:02:37.380> lips<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.250> little<00:02:38.310> bit

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
find that some lips are a little bit

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
find that some lips are a little bit
more<00:02:38.760> blue<00:02:39.150> purple<00:02:39.590> which<00:02:40.590> means<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> that's

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
more blue purple which means that that's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.510 
more blue purple which means that that's
going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.700> pull<00:02:42.060> every<00:02:42.690> pigment<00:02:43.260> into<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:44.100> blue

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
going to pull every pigment into a blue

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.420 
going to pull every pigment into a blue
purple<00:02:44.850> range<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:46.140> when<00:02:46.590> someone<00:02:47.040> tells<00:02:47.250> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430

of<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> time<00:04:05.519> I<00:04:05.730> find<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:07.530> my<00:04:07.590> clients<00:04:08.280> think

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
of the time I find that my clients think

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.759 
of the time I find that my clients think
they<00:04:08.850> want<00:04:09.090> full<00:04:09.390> lips<00:04:09.660> when<00:04:10.230> really<00:04:10.530> what

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
they want full lips when really what

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.190 
they want full lips when really what
we're<00:04:10.980> trying<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.579> is<00:04:11.790> restore<00:04:12.690> the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
we're trying to do is restore the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.300 
we're trying to do is restore the
natural<00:04:13.440> definition<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.360> lip<00:04:15.660> so<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
natural definition of the lip so that

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.910 
natural definition of the lip so that
really<00:04:17.669> is<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.090> prettiest<00:04:18.600> procedure<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.470> the

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
really is the prettiest procedure is the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.580 
really is the prettiest procedure is the
lip<00:04:20.340> liner<00:04:20.580> because<00:04:20.850> what<00:04:21.570> happens<00:04:22.050> to<00:04:22.320> what

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
lip liner because what happens to what

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.530 
lip liner because what happens to what
we<00:04:22.710> call<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.070> Vermilion<00:04:23.670> border<00:04:23.940> which<00:04:24.330> is

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
we call the Vermilion border which is

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.200 
we call the Vermilion border which is
that<00:04:24.780> Ridge<00:04:25.260> right<00:04:25.740> before<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.730> turns<00:04:27.030> into

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
that Ridge right before it turns into

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.690 
that Ridge right before it turns into
facial<00:04:27.780> tissue<00:04:28.020> we're<00:04:28.800> trying<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.280> define

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
facial tissue we're trying to define

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.690 
facial tissue we're trying to define
that<00:04:29.730> border<00:04:30.570> because<00:04:31.410> oftentimes<00:04:31.890> with<00:04:32.250> age

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
that border because oftentimes with age

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.450 
that border because oftentimes with age
we<00:04:33.420> get<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> loss<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:34.020> pigment<00:04:34.620> through<00:04:35.190> that

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
we get a loss of pigment through that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.080 
we get a loss of pigment through that
border<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:37.440> actually<00:04:37.650> get<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> loss<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.790> lip

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
border so we actually get a loss of lip

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.930 
border so we actually get a loss of lip
definition<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.470> oftentimes<00:04:41.130> we<00:04:41.460> don't<00:04:41.640> really

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
definition so oftentimes we don't really

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.660 
definition so oftentimes we don't really
need<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.360> lot<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.780> color<00:04:43.050> through<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.470> mouth

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
need a lot of color through the mouth

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.580 
need a lot of color through the mouth
and<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.850> shaded<00:04:45.330> lip<00:04:45.510> liner<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.960> enough<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:46.560> I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
and a shaded lip liner is enough so I

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.290 
and a shaded lip liner is enough so I
hope<00:04:46.860> you've<00:04:47.070> learned<00:04:47.340> something<00:04:47.520> about<00:04:47.910> lips

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300
