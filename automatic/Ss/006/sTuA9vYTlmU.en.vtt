00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.960 
monitors is becoming less and less and
that's<00:00:27.860> a<00:00:27.980> great<00:00:28.220> thing<00:00:28.460> because<00:00:28.640> you<00:00:28.880> get

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
that's a great thing because you get

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.179 
that's a great thing because you get
less<00:00:29.210> sound<00:00:29.480> on<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.810> platform<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:31.040> makes

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
less sound on the platform and it makes

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.920 
less sound on the platform and it makes

second<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:49.010> now<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.670> difference<00:00:50.120> here<00:00:50.329> and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
second here now the difference here and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.720 
second here now the difference here and
what<00:00:50.840> makes<00:00:51.020> them<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:51.260> compact<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.250> small<00:00:52.430> you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
what makes them so compact and small you

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.490 
what makes them so compact and small you
can<00:00:52.910> see<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.149> can<00:00:53.480> lift<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:53.870> thing<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.350> can

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
can see I can lift this thing you can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.100 
can see I can lift this thing you can
see<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.829> relative<00:00:55.250> size<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.760> very<00:00:56.090> compact<00:00:56.660> is

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
see the relative size is very compact is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.260 
see the relative size is very compact is
that<00:00:57.320> they're<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.500> coax<00:00:58.040> monitor<00:00:58.579> what<00:00:59.180> the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
that they're a coax monitor what the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.360 
that they're a coax monitor what the
coax<00:00:59.660> mean<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.170> you've<00:01:00.320> got<00:01:00.440> an<00:01:00.530> 8<00:01:00.680> inch<00:01:00.920> or<00:01:01.129> 10

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
coax mean is you've got an 8 inch or 10

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.850 
coax mean is you've got an 8 inch or 10
inch<00:01:01.550> woofer<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.149> then<00:01:02.629> inside<00:01:03.110> at<00:01:03.559> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
inch woofer and then inside at the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.770 
inch woofer and then inside at the
center<00:01:04.220> is<00:01:04.520> your<00:01:04.759> high<00:01:04.910> frequency<00:01:05.449> driver

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
center is your high frequency driver

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.469 
center is your high frequency driver
gives<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.890> two<00:01:07.070> things<00:01:07.399> the<00:01:07.640> compact<00:01:08.149> size

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
gives you two things the compact size

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.310 
gives you two things the compact size
but<00:01:09.200> also<00:01:09.229> excellent<00:01:10.039> mid-range<00:01:10.399> sound

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
but also excellent mid-range sound

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.870 
but also excellent mid-range sound
because<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.350> sound<00:01:12.830> wave<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.280> emanating<00:01:13.610> both

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
because the sound wave is emanating both

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.490 
because the sound wave is emanating both
at<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.149> low<00:01:14.300> frequencies<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.350> high

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
at the low frequencies and the high

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.859 
at the low frequencies and the high
frequencies<00:01:16.130> from<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.610> center<00:01:16.970> that<00:01:17.570> means

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
frequencies from the center that means

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.440 
frequencies from the center that means
that<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.440> get<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.680> nice<00:01:18.979> wide<00:01:19.640> coverage

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
that you get a nice wide coverage

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.669 
that you get a nice wide coverage
because<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:20.840> reduce<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.380> amount<00:01:21.619> of

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
because you reduce the amount of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.050 
because you reduce the amount of
interference<00:01:22.220> between<00:01:22.399> a<00:01:22.640> high<00:01:22.850> frequency

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
interference between a high frequency

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.150 
interference between a high frequency
driver<00:01:23.630> which<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:23.990> located<00:01:24.380> off<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.950> side

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
driver which is located off to the side

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.249 
driver which is located off to the side
and<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.910> low<00:01:26.060> frequency<00:01:26.240> driver<00:01:26.869> which<00:01:27.110> is

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
and a low frequency driver which is

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.949 
and a low frequency driver which is
separated<00:01:27.800> from<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:28.190> so<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.910> coax<00:01:29.390> gives<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
separated from it so the coax gives you

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.320 
separated from it so the coax gives you
at<00:01:30.319> the<00:01:30.619> crossover<00:01:31.130> frequency<00:01:31.330> smooth

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
at the crossover frequency smooth

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.020 
at the crossover frequency smooth
coverage<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.110> you've<00:01:33.470> got<00:01:33.679> about<00:01:33.860> 120<00:01:34.670> degree

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
coverage and you've got about 120 degree

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.449 
coverage and you've got about 120 degree
wide<00:01:35.300> coverage<00:01:35.929> here<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:36.319> well<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.190> can

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
wide coverage here as well so you can

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.850 
wide coverage here as well so you can
run<00:01:37.670> 2<00:01:37.940> or<00:01:38.149> 3<00:01:38.479> singers<00:01:38.869> off<00:01:39.080> of<00:01:39.259> one<00:01:39.410> monitor

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
run 2 or 3 singers off of one monitor

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.320 
run 2 or 3 singers off of one monitor
where<00:01:40.039> a<00:01:40.069> lot<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.490> wedge<00:01:40.640> monitors<00:01:41.149> are
