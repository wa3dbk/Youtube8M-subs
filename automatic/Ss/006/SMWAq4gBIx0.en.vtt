00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 Good day to all of you soap and today I 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.760
 tell you and show you how to play gta 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.179
 4 on windows 8 but first to my 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.790
 problem and all just because steam yes 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.150
 and the year itself loads life for the seven and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.220
 general trends for what 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.990
 you also download this live 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.740
 directly to the eight 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.450
 but do not look anywhere else for this live and everywhere 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.970
 downloaded fucking mail.ru 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.570
 but luckily I was able to get a worker 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.370
 judges alcohol hangs with you and so we 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 remove two applications lava which 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.000
 put steam or gta 4 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.540
 and this is guns for windows live marketplace 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 and register the blok itself actually download 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.019
 yes two files for installation from the description 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.299
 to this video so when musa norris 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.339
 resist killed was actually still special 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.519
 you do not have to run it by letters 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:58.540
 the file you install it there something 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.339
 quickly downloads it does not forget 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.430
 you marketplace there is almost the same but 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.299
 here it loads a little bit slower and 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.560
 at the end you press the start button 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.619
 a small window opens in this la 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.510
 gente saved can fly and he login you 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.150
 close off the app forever and 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.780
 no longer remember them after these 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.580
 simple steps in principle gta 4 you will be 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.470
 run on windows 8 without any 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.920
 critical errors and other such 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.030
 shit 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.340
 but unfortunately that's not all 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.010
 it ends when gta 4 is still 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.800
 there may be more problems 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.530
 for example , I had one problem when 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.930
 logo rockstar both loaded but the menu 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.850
 the main thing is not loaded 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.300
 Actually I saw a black screen so 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.860
 but it's just that 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.450
 gta 4 is loaded first the process will be 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.280
 take two minutes each time on 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 then it will load quickly and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 almost immediately there is more 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.230
 one problem and she is more 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.960
 common when everything is already 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.530
 immersed mature and main menu 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.600
 but life doesn't want to take clicks 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.660
 your mouse no matter how strong was not 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.300
 even steam against you at this moment 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.540
 that he doesn't work here, either 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.950
 I advise you to go to the root gta 4 to find 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.600
 file gta 4. x and open its properties and 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.210
 go to the compatibility tab 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.860
 here we put a tick and actually 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.690
 choose something from this list and 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.870
 now they are windows 98 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.780
 but from the options here you can put a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.600
 windows xp service pack 3 windows 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.810
 vista pack 12 and the actual species itself 7 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.070
 but I personally work on windows xp 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.209
 sp 3 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.800
 and actually think on this for everyone 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.090
 thanks for watching the likes 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 subscribe everyone bye
