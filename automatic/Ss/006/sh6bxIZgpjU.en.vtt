00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
doing something new so I mean a I've

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
doing something new so I mean a I've
made<00:00:17.520> structures<00:00:17.880> involving<00:00:18.750> redstone<00:00:19.199> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
made structures involving redstone so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.109 
made structures involving redstone so
the<00:00:19.500> first<00:00:19.710> thing<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.000> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the first thing I would doing is a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
the first thing I would doing is a
ticker<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.279> bit<00:00:23.880> thicker<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:25.340> meaning

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
ticker it's a bit thicker so meaning

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
ticker it's a bit thicker so meaning
when<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> activate<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.289> second

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
when I activate that at about a second

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.110 
when I activate that at about a second
1.5<00:00:29.429> seconds<00:00:29.820> each<00:00:30.090> um<00:00:30.920> they<00:00:31.920> change<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
second on those and the i turn it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
second on those and the i turn it
if<00:00:49.289> i<00:00:49.469> turn<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> lights<00:00:49.920> back<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:51.829> every<00:00:52.829> 1.5

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
if i turn the lights back on every 1.5

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.600 
if i turn the lights back on every 1.5
seconds<00:00:53.879> around<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:55.170> light<00:00:55.379> comes<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.579> on

seconds around the light comes on so on

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
seconds around the light comes on so on
and<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.350> realized<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.770> was

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and so on I realized that that was

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.610 
and so on I realized that that was
pretty<00:00:59.070> simple<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.079> said<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.440> neck

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pretty simple and said to go to my neck

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.580 
pretty simple and said to go to my neck
next<00:01:02.250> project<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.640> has<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.330> exact<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.290> has

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
next project a it has the exact it has

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
next project a it has the exact it has
that<00:01:07.799> components<00:01:08.340> able<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that components able to take it as a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.420 
that components able to take it as a
computer<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
computer so I can make this into like a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
computer so I can make this into like a
nail<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.799> but<00:01:13.799> I'd<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> make<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> bigger

it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.440 

alright<00:02:06.430> yeah<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:10.240> main<00:02:10.420> thing

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
alright yeah so this is the main thing

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:20.120 
alright yeah so this is the main thing
itself<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.440> reason<00:02:12.750> second<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:16.540> bottom

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:37.670 

bottom<00:02:21.130> mid<00:02:21.520> should<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:22.090> off

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.720 

that<00:02:38.340> should<00:02:38.549> get<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.909> go<00:02:39.109> um<00:02:40.109> yeah<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.640> only

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that should get a go um yeah so the only

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
that should get a go um yeah so the only
reason<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.299> one<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.780> turning<00:02:42.989> off

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
reason that this one is not turning off

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990 
reason that this one is not turning off
is<00:02:43.379> because<00:02:43.560> I'm<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.859> done<00:02:44.159> as<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.609> can<00:02:44.819> see

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
is because I'm not done as you can see

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.580 
is because I'm not done as you can see
its<00:02:45.150> components<00:02:45.750> are<00:02:45.870> still<00:02:46.459> left<00:02:47.459> empty<00:02:48.590> so

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
its components are still left empty so

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.770 
its components are still left empty so
the<00:02:49.709> laggy<00:02:50.010> because<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.459> lots<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:51.120> lots<00:02:51.540> of

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
the laggy because I lots of lots of

compressed<00:03:22.919> on<00:03:23.189> youtube<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.239> am<00:03:24.389> the

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
compressed on youtube I think I am the

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.899 
compressed on youtube I think I am the
only<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:25.109> who's<00:03:25.379> made<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.859> where<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.700> only

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
only one who's made it where the only

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.789 
only one who's made it where the only
sides<00:03:27.299> are<00:03:27.599> activated<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.379> can<00:03:28.530> pick<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
sides are activated and you can pick it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.490 
sides are activated and you can pick it
from<00:03:28.919> a<00:03:29.069> control<00:03:29.459> panel<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:31.109> think<00:03:31.319> I'm<00:03:31.379> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
from a control panel and I think I'm the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.839 
from a control panel and I think I'm the
only<00:03:31.530> one<00:03:31.709> who<00:03:31.799> made<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.069> too<00:03:32.189> small<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.639> far

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
only one who made it too small so far

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.520 
only one who made it too small so far
that's<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.480> compressed<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.079> it's<00:03:34.260> I'm

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530
