for<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> most<00:04:16.519> part<00:04:17.560> drivers<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:19.780> respect<00:04:20.780> it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
for the most part drivers a respect it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.390

which<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.200> good<00:04:21.410> thing<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:24.200> guess<00:04:25.040> that's<00:04:25.190> a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
which is a good thing I guess that's a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.780 
which is a good thing I guess that's a
universal<00:04:26.139> in<00:04:27.139> every<00:04:27.410> state<00:04:27.740> i<00:04:27.770> guess<00:04:28.130> she's

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
universal in every state i guess she's

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.750 
universal in every state i guess she's
no<00:04:28.940> person<00:04:29.889> universal<00:04:30.889> in<00:04:30.979> every<00:04:31.190> state<00:04:31.490> and

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
no person universal in every state and

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.100 
no person universal in every state and
that<00:04:32.210> makes<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.630> lot<00:04:32.810> of<00:04:32.870> sense<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:35.630> makes<00:04:35.870> us

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
that makes a lot of sense it makes us

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.870 
that makes a lot of sense it makes us
much<00:04:36.350> sense<00:04:36.710> as<00:04:36.860> like<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> pageant<00:04:37.729> Miss

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
much sense as like the pageant Miss

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.330 
much sense as like the pageant Miss
