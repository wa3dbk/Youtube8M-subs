00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.110
 Hello, everyone, how are you doing? 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.959
 as I said in the previous video to do 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 cupcakes that I went up a little bit ago 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.500
 I leave here somewhere 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.540
 I told them that I was going to make the video of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.270
 how to make it bounce cream that is this 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.710
 decoration that carries over then 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.540
 this is the video in which I teach you to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.849
 make it for example that they carry a 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.130
 This is pink because it has coloring 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.350
 pink and good you can innovate to throw 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.540
 Nutella jams throw what you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 you want and also the colors 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 that you want and make it of all the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.910
 possible colors so I leave you with the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.879
 video you will see that it is super easy to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.500
 do and it's very fun and I leave you with 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.180
 the video so you know how it's done 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.879
 good for water cream 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.000
 we are going to need 125 grams of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.549
 soft butter that is this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.269
 mercadona landowner and we are worth 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:03.600
 perfectly 225 grams of icing sugar 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.309
 sieved sie sie with it as it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.440
 call with the scribe 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.890
 now with the sifted the density with 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 a little thing of these 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 and two tablespoons of milk two tablespoons 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.619
 you taste a little essence of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.479
 vanilla or what you want to put in 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.520
 case of wanting to put it color as a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.360
 coloring for example these of wilton 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.310
 what are they like and in case you want 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.990
 put some other thing more then you can 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.229
 put nutella for example as I'm going 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.110
 to put myself or innovate and put what 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.560
 that you want strawberry jam good 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
 and everyone is free so we're going to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.500
 make it 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 the basic recipe to do it to what 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.479
 we have to do is mix half of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.690
 sugar with all other ingredients 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.610
 without mixing everything, beat it and then 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.220
 when the dough is well done 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.179
 we mix already made shows all the rest 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.160
 of the sugar and already with that mass we are going to 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.360
 do what is the battery and now it is what 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.490
 I teach 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.930
 we mix well all the ingredients and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.000
 now for example I'm going to do the one on the 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.250
 and what I'm going to do is throw a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 little of nutella to this mass 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.780
 we mix everything is fine it has a mass 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.190
 homogeneous and now we would have prepared 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.240
 to put in the pastry bag and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.240
 decorate the cuts 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 Well now we fill the sleeve 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.900
 pastry that we have this any 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.960
 as our water cream and we apply it 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.670
 the way we want we can do 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.670
 little flowers 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.930
 for example good was a little 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 uncoordinated and the sun state 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.870
 or we can only do a little rosquita like that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.890
 in the middle 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.440
 this already a little as we want but the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.830
 technique would be that now I'm going to teach you 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.440
 the water cream with color way times 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.840
 pink I think and so they see this says the same 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.790
 mass from before but I added a little 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.440
 of the east syrup of strawberry of squire 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.440
 you can add the one you want 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.070
 and I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.070
 coloring to make more rosita 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.170
 I'm going to use this brand dye 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.770
 wilton that is pink pink 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.500
 there we are and there I am going to be very 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:52.180
 little bit and mixed with milk that 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.180
 little dye you'll see 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.750
 we beat it well for about 4 minutes and 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.770
 you are ready to fill the sleeve and 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.770
 decorate the cupcakes 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.020
 Well, you can see how the rosita is 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.420
 it looks like gum is super cute and this is 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.090
 the idea that you can decorate to decorate 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.920
 in different ways with the battery 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.780
 make it in different colors and it's going 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.100
 carlos sympathetic so I hope that you 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.090
 have liked the video and see you in the 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.090
 next a little kiss
