00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 alexander hello the one worth 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.970
 probably already can guess the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.429
 others know what it is the iphone 5 c 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.290
 Let's take a look at it now 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 make two parts for now a whole 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.429
 normal unboxing so you see what there 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.369
 in it is immediately anticipated that the uk 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.840
 version makes it a lot cheaper than 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.789
 now something else 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 it takes just a normal 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.529
 adapter plug cd but also the same and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 then in the second part 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.859
 I need a cover then I can really 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.660
 Best to play around in front of your nose like that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.099
 does the sim card work now ? 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.520
 insert the had to run now too 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 pick up 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.219
 We'll look at each other for the first time 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.170
 box is in it and then there's something else 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 Sharing is here is my camera 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.460
 down and the hater video to android 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 and I am not doing here that there 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 some extra video because it is 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 I give you a story 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 All must say calm and will 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 not so a hero gives the answer video 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.190
 must massa to the box here yes I have 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.870
 have the sun foil around it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.030
 I've already checked out here so here 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 lid is on it and then you have that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 device and that is now here in one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.510
 plastic cover in it 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.760
 earlier 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 I would laugh at you yes that was earlier 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.700
 well above other rausholen ok well 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.490
 but plastic wrap in it 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.560
 the weird out there is okay that 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.469
 the device is a comparison to first 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.819
 my outdoor dealer android phone 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.770
 drastically thin here 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.340
 So I could see that how much 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.159
 thinner 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.929
 the length is about the same but it 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:03.539
 is significantly thinner from the broader 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.539
 with thick here is already crass 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 could happen miracles 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.450
 ok processing milk must say it is 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.120
 stop with plastic history because I would have 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.340
 dear son adolf finish but so is 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.519
 Feels worthy of a weighty one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.120
 not so easy by that already has 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.950
 severe 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 It's not that easy, it's not like me 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.880
 The Irish have read quite big 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.250
 good battery built always curious 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.319
 balance sheet but holds otherwise from now on 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.829
 You can not do anything with the processing here 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.769
 say 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.870
 once free groping easy to reach the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.090
 homebutton works here and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.160
 So otherwise quite normal at the same 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.359
 Stade is just that's just not 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.120
 Apple iPhone 5 or 5 s aluminum housing 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.380
 has okay here the sim card I have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.630
 already said I show you in 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.220
 all calm as the thing works 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:57.010
 if I sim card inserted the box 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:03.760
 you have the manual also apple 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.359
 typical pretty made and taste 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.630
 car on it is the needle that would have 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.700
 cancel 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.400
 you do not get any important 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.190
 sim card inserted it also makes in 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.209
 all rest then you have a hello hello 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.209
 hello always good 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.880
 class therefore as I said the ok 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.530
 variant is the uk variant and with the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.610
 can not start that much 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.310
 so stop 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.040
 agrees to complete the seller 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.710
 but is not a thing taken multiply 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.850
 From this plan, the devices 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.010
 headphones with micro and what you stop 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.920
 for that she needs if she will ever use 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.080
 clear how fast we always know you 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.900
 he headphones have this off that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.140
 Here and here you have that, too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.170
 loading cable but this totally need worth 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.630
 because I do not have an older ipad 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.280
 behind but the charging cable with language 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.910
 all in there saw all times that 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.920
 the device that this might well what's inside 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.910
 okay and now I will with one 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.910
 stocked up to the card
