00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.060
 hi speed friends in health I'm Luis 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.130
 war and in this capsule I'm going to 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.900
 show a circuit of three exercises 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.900
 to develop the biceps 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.860
 before starting our training 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.660
 It is vital to start with a 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.120
 previous warming where we're going to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.450
 use the dumbbells and let's do 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.489
 the alternate movement we first do 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.950
 20 repetitions on one arm and then the 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.680
 another in this way we are going to perform 4 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.020
 series with little weight now if this same 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.790
 we are going to do it for 12 15 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.580
 repetitions but with a moderate weight 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.770
 to start our circuit this is 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.870
 very important we will be either 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.640
 sitting or standing I recommend that if 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.520
 you are a beginner, do it sitting for 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 that you do not have any movement in the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.440
 back and you stay totally 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.970
 right we use a bench of 90 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.670
 degrees where you're going to be sitting 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.340
 we start with the right arm 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.530
 we do 12 repetitions and after 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.229
 we alternate with the left one too 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.970
 let's have the elbows well attached to 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.580
 our sides and we are going to do the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.010
 contraction just up doing 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.530
 as much strength as possible so that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.030
 part of the biceps sits the most 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.030
 contracted possible 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.100
 the next exercise that we are going to 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.630
 perform the hammer is called hammer 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.909
 with the position in which we use the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.009
 Let's take cufflink cufflink 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.090
 our side towards the center of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.090
 our body 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.759
 in this way we keep the elbows well 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 glued to our sides and we are going to 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.500
 perform 12 to 15 repetitions first 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.729
 an arm and then the one that follows what 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 you can do sitting down if you're 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.820
 beginner or stopped if you already have 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.820
 control of your body 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.530
 the third exercise for this circuit 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.440
 is going to be concentrated with dumbbell is 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.330
 very important that we do not lean on the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.910
 We will only use the leg as 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.790
 reference and let's leave the free weight 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.300
 let's go up and do the contraction in 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.920
 the highest part of the flex and of 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.680
 this way we are going to have a greater 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.900
 contraction remembers 12 15 repetitions 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.600
 an arm and then we continue with the one 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.650
 go on and so we go back to start our 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.810
 circuit 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.000
 I hope these tips help you carry 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.799
 a healthier life I am of war and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.799
 this is and it is good health
