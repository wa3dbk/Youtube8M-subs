 they enter a patient of a 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.590
 psychiatric hospital where the 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.620
 torture and murder interacts with the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 mouse in certain scenes the use of 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.909
 webcams and headphones as well as the

 a simple game its textures are 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.010
 good the characters look good but 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.719
 the bad thing about this game is that the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.090
 enemies are the people who love you 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.579

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.280
 easy to kill them the target as you see it in 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.459
