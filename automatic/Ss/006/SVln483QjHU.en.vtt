00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.570
 hi to all his colleagues come 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.040
 I hope you're fine but it will 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.720
 super good we find ourselves today 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.880
 with a top 5 ranking 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.310
 boost and we start right away 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.150
 with little boosters that are the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.440
 less naughty brigands top number 5 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.030
 since it's just trying to make 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.190
 shots in the head as their little gun 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.230
 but he does not look for bouquets their 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.970
 strydonk body the only drawback 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.890
 is to find yourself on a map to five 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.720
 against five instead of 2 to 6 against 6 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.809
 month so it's not the most troublesome 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.010
 but that's a bit disturbing even 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.100
 if we can understand mistakes 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.280
 people find the challenges quite long and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.150
 which happened at this stage and define 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.260
 a little boost like that ok the booster 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.970
 given a little bit 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.970
 intelligent since he was away from 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.199
 his colleague and he gets closer a little 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.120
 we even manage to see that the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.340
 even closely they can not do 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.740
 their shots in the head so to ask 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 if they have really smart so 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.920
 that's pretty funny 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.619
 so here it has not worked at all 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.850
 as usa wanted it appeared appeared 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.150
 what is happening 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.330
 what's going on here is there is a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.750
 like this shot in the head holds in the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.000
 head 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.680
 good this and everyday it's not very 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.790
 easy but good I do not see the interest 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:37.240
 of booster deserve to do that if you 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.360
 can not have your weapons in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.550
 diamond in order to boost it even happens to 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.890
 see that boosting is not smart 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.610
 since he's doing there carol because I 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.500
 more funny then booster fears of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.260
 number four in fourth position or 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.170
 wanted to organize so that are not 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.970
 very far either 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.439
 we end up wondering what that 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.080
 do the others on the map we come to 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.150
 the deaf happens to be spotted 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.100
 anyway since after a while 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.220
 we finish the holes and what plays 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 this card is not a lot of stamp 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.060
 and it's pretty boring because you 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.480
 unlock their money score for not too much 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.920
 interest but now we'll see who 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.319
 could do as a hope of skiing and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.480
 to be ducked well done for them one 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.209
 will say but it's still mission 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.660
 on part of lanes 1 and 3 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.550
 the shouting up is the same 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.709
 I really like it is that it is our 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 blow with this kind of booster which 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.970
 are going to unlock their strict scores then 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.910
 there yes I tend face there were some 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.170
 blocks that are his lightning in dryden 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.600
 fire and then a fight lob it's 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.069
 boring because seven rifles your party 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.930
 you remind me I was at psg it's 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.350
 this part there it was a good start 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.390
 of part and then that completely 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.680
 screwed up the part after it's not 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.880
 amazing that there are some who make the rachid 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.500
 I did not understand why they 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.019
 were going to take a bath do they 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.190
 were hot I do not know why 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.650
 or simply sought to make 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.640
 sanguinet launched boosted a number two 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.900
 so please precisely they are going 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.730
 to be unlocked their strict sport but this 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.010
 that I find disgusting and so 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.470
 one of the two obviously has it in 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.420
 the other in my team and they 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.070
 denounced our locations does there 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.930
 said to the other or but moved and 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.049
 the other it allowed us to frag 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.480
 and know where we were going to arrive and 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.950
 to be able to liquidate without being able to do anything 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.950
 do what she does that it's really 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.970
 disgusting caterpillar the sq a bomb 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.530
 of noise day all the device of the same 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.890
 way there is no point in doing this 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.790
 kind is this beauf only to laugh 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.230
 i hope treyarch a job that 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.030
 will really provide on the question because 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.010
 that the tactical assertion 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.959
 I do not see the interest it's true that 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.780
 it can help some emotions in some 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.790
 matches the goal but after a while 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.270
 stop the bullshit we need 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.100
 delete 100 and then that's it 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.830
 if it pleases me I really hope that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.870
 good politics treyarch had said that he 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
 can come is really the booster on 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.140
 does not have much difference until 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.180
 now at least two boosters I 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.400
 found almost every day and 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.700
 in the fight see in the last top 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.820
 a cushion of even seen in on two 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.989
 different days what is it really 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.420
 painful when we make parties have 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.580
 started a game then we end up 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.200
 with in front of people who put their 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.570
 strek star here says rot your 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.860
 left 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.960
 so it's a shame it's a shame 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.490
 here we are, we're typing 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.230
 boost number one 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.390
 our little booster here not able to 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.170
 mount the family in gold in a way 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.790
 normal fall with his boyfriend who 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.020
 he has diamond weapons so it's 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.800
 the same, one wonders how he has 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.810
 managed to get them 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.000
 when we see them like that we ask ourselves 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.900
 really that after questions it's 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.720
 really lamentable 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.960
 these clouds is because this cease 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.110
 booster I issued in early ranking 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.590
 because they will unlock ray rooney 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.190
 stealthy on whoever to fal then after 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.120
 the star lot and he'll end up there the 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.220
 date of fight 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.660
 it's a sore and we have a problem 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.020
 is that NATO does the same thing 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.310
 thing 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.630
 so he really rotted part one 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.850
 not surprising that we find 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.430
 breeds that says nothing is painful for 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.890
 everyone for our little players 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.750
 because after us who want to make 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.500
 good sco games with this kind of 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.530
 guy in front who rot really 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.910
 the lot no own parking lot tells you 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.130
 the worst is that I saw them 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.780
 play the next day I found in 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.640
 another part they did exactly 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.249
 the same thing is really lamentable 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.249
 if nobody sucks 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:50.079
 deeply innovative unique from 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.929
 complain I hope someday things 

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:54.729
 have changed on that side so forget 

00:05:52.929 --> 00:05:56.229
 not if you meet to see each other 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:59.799
 booster to report them there are some 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.619
 possibilities to do via the xbox or the 

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:04.689
 ps3 and exclude them like me I 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:08.229
 made to try to meet them 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:10.149
 on the here it is so I will you 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.159
 leave there on a thousand ideas for 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:13.599
 the booster and no merit to do this 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.179
 kind of thing if you do not get it 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.459
 put your guns in diamonds but such 

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:20.709
 is not it if you do not have a challenge 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.479
 do not do it's pana take your 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:24.419
 time to do it otherwise it's useless 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.439
 to boost that rotten two communities 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.519
 this is the day thank you to all are 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.419
 See you soon for more videos 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.419
 lease
