00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
way with every combo of gem and die so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.180 
way with every combo of gem and die so
you<00:03:07.049> can<00:03:07.230> name<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.440> like<00:03:07.709> whatever<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.160> want

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
any other item and then BAM there you go

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.479 
any other item and then BAM there you go
you<00:03:15.510> got<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> crusher<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:16.859> after<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.430> I

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
you got the crusher then after that I

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.680

because<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:18.230> there<00:05:19.230> was<00:05:19.380> two<00:05:19.560> signs<00:05:19.830> here<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.400> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
because I there was two signs here and I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.400 
because I there was two signs here and I
thought<00:05:20.910> it<00:05:21.060> maybe<00:05:21.240> would<00:05:21.780> look<00:05:21.960> better<00:05:22.140> if<00:05:22.350> I

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
thought it maybe would look better if I

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.590 
thought it maybe would look better if I
just<00:05:22.590> had<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> third<00:05:23.010> sign<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.610> had<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.540> add

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
just had a third sign so I had to add

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.800 
just had a third sign so I had to add
something<00:05:25.110> okay<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:26.420> basically<00:05:27.420> what<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.630> do

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
something okay but basically what you do

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.150 
something okay but basically what you do
with<00:05:28.050> your<00:05:28.080> forged<00:05:28.470> sword<00:05:28.680> is<00:05:28.770> you<00:05:28.860> have<00:05:29.010> the

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
with your forged sword is you have the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.370 
with your forged sword is you have the
ability<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.610> enchant<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.240> and<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.170> why<00:05:31.320> I'm

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
ability to enchant it and that's why I'm

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.930 
ability to enchant it and that's why I'm
level<00:05:31.590> 600<00:05:32.010> 90s<00:05:32.340> because<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.700> easily

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
level 600 90s because I can easily

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.640 
level 600 90s because I can easily
enchant<00:05:33.390> stuff<00:05:33.600> so<00:05:34.110> we<00:05:34.290> got<00:05:34.410> smite<00:05:34.620> for

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
enchant stuff so we got smite for

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.290 
enchant stuff so we got smite for
honestly<00:05:35.250> that's<00:05:35.460> not<00:05:35.580> even<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:35.730> great<00:05:36.000> so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
honestly that's not even that great so

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.260 
honestly that's not even that great so
it's<00:05:36.570> a<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:37.770> no<00:05:38.190> okay<00:05:38.580> that's<00:05:38.820> that<00:05:39.120> was

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it's a it no okay that's that was

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.140 
it's a it no okay that's that was
unfortunate<00:05:39.900> okay<00:05:40.650> basically<00:05:41.150> sometimes

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
unfortunate okay basically sometimes

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.210 
unfortunate okay basically sometimes
you'll<00:05:42.570> get<00:05:42.720> like<00:05:42.930> three<00:05:43.500> enchantments<00:05:44.100> on

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
you'll get like three enchantments on

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.440 
you'll get like three enchantments on
this<00:05:44.340> thing<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.610> know<00:05:44.670> that<00:05:44.760> happens<00:05:45.210> sometimes

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
this thing I know that happens sometimes

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.560 
this thing I know that happens sometimes
with<00:05:45.780> level<00:05:46.050> 30<00:05:46.260> on<00:05:46.470> normal<00:05:46.770> swords<00:05:47.100> but<00:05:47.790> I

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
with level 30 on normal swords but I

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.080 
with level 30 on normal swords but I
guess<00:05:49.410> you'll<00:05:49.830> get<00:05:50.040> more<00:05:50.190> Luckies<00:05:50.640> what<00:05:50.910> that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
guess you'll get more Luckies what that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.560 
guess you'll get more Luckies what that
means<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.510> gives<00:05:51.660> you<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.780> niche<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.380> increased

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
means it gives you a niche and increased

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.270 
means it gives you a niche and increased
enchant<00:05:54.570> ability<00:05:55.230> which<00:05:55.830> means<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.160> could

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
enchant ability which means you could

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.550 
enchant ability which means you could
potentially<00:05:56.880> get<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.630> lot<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:58.050> good<00:05:58.200> to<00:05:58.290> chant

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
potentially get a lot of good to chant

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.190 
potentially get a lot of good to chant
Mint's<00:05:58.920> enchantments<00:05:59.730> more<00:05:59.970> than<00:06:00.150> normal<00:06:00.360> so

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
Mint's enchantments more than normal so

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.160 
Mint's enchantments more than normal so
that's<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.830> good<00:06:02.040> thing<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.430> guess<00:06:02.790> I<00:06:02.970> suppose<00:06:03.360> I

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
that's a good thing I guess I suppose I

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.890 
that's a good thing I guess I suppose I
think<00:06:04.710> that<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.580> make<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:05.850> mod<00:06:06.120> go<00:06:06.540> even

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
think that to make this mod go even

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.530 
think that to make this mod go even
further<00:06:07.140> I<00:06:07.560> would<00:06:07.830> add<00:06:08.070> special<00:06:08.820> abilities<00:06:09.360> to

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
further I would add special abilities to

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.090 
further I would add special abilities to
maybe<00:06:09.690> different<00:06:10.080> colors<00:06:10.440> or<00:06:10.680> something<00:06:10.950> that

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
maybe different colors or something that

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.160 
maybe different colors or something that
would<00:06:11.160> be<00:06:11.310> really<00:06:11.820> really<00:06:11.850> cool

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
would be really really cool

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.390 
would be really really cool
and<00:06:13.410> that<00:06:13.530> sounds<00:06:13.770> like<00:06:13.800> a<00:06:13.890> good<00:06:14.100> idea<00:06:14.190> but

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
and that sounds like a good idea but

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.280 
and that sounds like a good idea but
otherwise<00:06:15.000> this<00:06:15.210> is<00:06:15.360> a<00:06:15.390> very<00:06:15.660> awesome<00:06:15.840> mod<00:06:16.140> it

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290
