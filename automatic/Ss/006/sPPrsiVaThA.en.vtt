 I already had it but I would replace it 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.789
 I try to do the best explained 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.600
 possible if they do not understand something they do not leave 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.709

 and return to our file sector 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.560

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.810
 to the android folder 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.490
 or babies if you do not have it you create the idea 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.690
 is to create a folder and you put everything
