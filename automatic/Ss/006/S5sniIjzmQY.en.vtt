at 720p HD so my hand could be traveling

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.030 
at 720p HD so my hand could be traveling
like<00:05:15.430> this<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:17.050> rocks<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.500> LTE

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
like this it rocks the LTE

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.250 
like this it rocks the LTE
up<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.370> 10<00:05:18.580> hours<00:05:18.970> of<00:05:19.000> battery<00:05:19.360> life<00:05:19.419> on<00:05:19.630> LTE<00:05:19.900> so

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
up to 10 hours of battery life on LTE so

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.020 
up to 10 hours of battery life on LTE so
that's<00:05:20.860> gonna<00:05:21.010> be<00:05:21.100> great<00:05:21.220> hopefully<00:05:21.610> my<00:05:21.850> phone
