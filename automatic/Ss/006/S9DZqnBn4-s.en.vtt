you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.680 

let's<00:00:40.920> go<00:00:41.100> for<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.339> kind<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.609> a<00:00:41.699> slow<00:00:41.909> Country

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
let's go for a kind of a slow Country

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.239 
let's go for a kind of a slow Country
Strong<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> mechanics<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> strum

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
Strong now the mechanics of the strum

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:48.380 
Strong now the mechanics of the strum
are<00:00:47.339> actually<00:00:47.609> quite<00:00:47.789> simple

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
are actually quite simple

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
are actually quite simple
we<00:00:48.539> simply<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:49.019> it<00:00:49.199> down<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:50.129> up<00:00:50.429> but<00:00:51.089> it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
we simply have it down down up but it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
we simply have it down down up but it's
how<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> field<00:00:52.079> gets<00:00:52.859> injected<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.489> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
how the field gets injected into that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
how the field gets injected into that
which<00:00:54.089> makes<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> difference<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.640> if<00:00:56.640> we

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
which makes all the difference so if we

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
which makes all the difference so if we
just<00:00:56.969> practice<00:00:57.299> with<00:00:57.329> muted<00:00:57.809> strings<00:00:58.019> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
just practice with muted strings it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.389 
just practice with muted strings it's
going<00:00:58.979> down<00:00:59.729> down<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:01.229> down<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:02.280> down

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
going down down up down down up down

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.080 
going down down up down down up down
down<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:03.750> down<00:01:03.869> down<00:01:04.789> so<00:01:05.789> you're<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
down up down down so you're kind of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
snapping you're down up and notice how

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
snapping you're down up and notice how
my<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.899> arm<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.619> relaxed<00:01:21.950> with<00:01:22.950> no

my my arm is really relaxed with no

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
my my arm is really relaxed with no
tension<00:01:23.429> so<00:01:24.209> let's<00:01:24.330> try<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> basic

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
tension so let's try and put that basic

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.120 
tension so let's try and put that basic
pattern<00:01:25.950> into<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.580> E<00:01:26.789> chord<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.069> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
pattern into an E chord so it's going to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
pattern into an E chord so it's going to
be<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.280> sixth<00:01:29.610> string<00:01:29.789> for<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.090> bass<00:01:30.270> note

if we to move to in a chord you'll be
