00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
time ago i didn't write because i don't

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
think I gave a star rating just because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
think I gave a star rating just because
I<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.869> kind<00:01:57.990> of

I don't know I don't know what kind of
star<00:01:58.290> rating<00:01:58.649> i<00:01:58.740> would<00:01:58.890> give<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.520> i

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
star rating i would give it because i

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.480 
star rating i would give it because i
really<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> series<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.530> i<00:02:01.890> don't<00:02:02.369> know

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
really like that series but i don't know

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.709 
really like that series but i don't know
if<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.670> necessarily<00:02:02.880> rate<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.450> five

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
