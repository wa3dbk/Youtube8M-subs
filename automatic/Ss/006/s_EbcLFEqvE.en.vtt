a tankless guys five girls in 10 games
for<00:02:58.220> me<00:02:58.400> 4.2<00:02:59.360> k<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.810> had<00:02:59.959> to<00:03:00.110> buy<00:03:00.260> him<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> M

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
for me 4.2 k I had to buy him in the M

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.530 
for me 4.2 k I had to buy him in the M
that<00:03:01.340> was<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.640> left<00:03:01.820> min<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.270> sniper

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
that was in the left min and the sniper

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.360 
that was in the left min and the sniper
so<00:03:02.870> pretty<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.770> could<00:03:03.860> probably<00:03:04.010> pick<00:03:04.160> him<00:03:04.310> up

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
we won the most with and so yeah I lost

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.660 
we won the most with and so yeah I lost
two<00:05:42.500> games<00:05:42.680> with<00:05:42.830> this<00:05:42.950> team<00:05:43.160> one<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.400> them<00:05:43.550> was

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
two games with this team one of them was

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.910 
two games with this team one of them was
quite<00:05:43.940> suckish<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.570> had<00:05:44.810> like<00:05:44.930> 20<00:05:45.350> shots<00:05:45.590> on

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
quite suckish I had like 20 shots on

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.740 
quite suckish I had like 20 shots on
target<00:05:45.980> and<00:05:46.730> he<00:05:46.820> had<00:05:46.910> about<00:05:47.090> three<00:05:47.360> shots<00:05:47.540> on

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
target and he had about three shots on

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.030 
target and he had about three shots on
target<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.140> I<00:05:48.200> think<00:05:48.350> you<00:05:48.410> beat<00:05:48.590> me<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:48.860> know

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
target and I think you beat me to know

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.500 
target and I think you beat me to know
it<00:05:49.190> just<00:05:49.340> didn't<00:05:49.640> make<00:05:49.730> sense<00:05:49.790> but<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.390> know

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
it just didn't make sense but you know

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.810 
it just didn't make sense but you know
it<00:05:50.960> is<00:05:51.080> what<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.290> is<00:05:51.380> so<00:05:52.010> this<00:05:52.190> this<00:05:52.490> formation

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
it is what it is so this this formation

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.360 
it is what it is so this this formation
has<00:05:53.180> been<00:05:53.380> more<00:05:54.380> like<00:05:54.530> that<00:05:54.680> information<00:05:55.250> be

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
has been more like that information be

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.460 
has been more like that information be
it's<00:05:55.550> pretty<00:05:55.940> incredible<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.540> just<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:57.020> don't

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
it's pretty incredible this just I don't

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.870 
it's pretty incredible this just I don't
know<00:05:57.560> sometimes<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.220> likes<00:05:58.490> if<00:05:58.640> you<00:05:58.730> don't

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
know sometimes it likes if you don't

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.250 
know sometimes it likes if you don't
have<00:05:59.030> midfielders<00:05:59.480> it<00:05:59.600> get<00:05:59.780> forward<00:06:00.080> you<00:06:00.170> have

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260

work<00:06:07.790> rates<00:06:08.030> on<00:06:08.180> Felipe<00:06:08.570> Melo<00:06:08.780> and<00:06:09.080> he's<00:06:09.980> got

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
work rates on Felipe Melo and he's got

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.460 
work rates on Felipe Melo and he's got
Snyder's<00:06:11.060> got<00:06:11.210> higher<00:06:11.750> attack<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.320> then<00:06:12.410> he

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
Snyder's got higher attack and then he

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.900 
Snyder's got higher attack and then he
has<00:06:12.620> defensive<00:06:12.830> so<00:06:13.280> he<00:06:13.370> gets<00:06:13.520> forward<00:06:13.790> more

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
has defensive so he gets forward more

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.120 
has defensive so he gets forward more
than<00:06:14.060> he<00:06:14.150> gets<00:06:14.300> back<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:14.840> I<00:06:15.590> don't<00:06:15.860> his

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
than he gets back and I don't his

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.230 
than he gets back and I don't his
formation<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.520> pretty<00:06:16.700> decent<00:06:16.820> one<00:06:17.090> of<00:06:17.180> the

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
formation is pretty decent one of the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.150 
formation is pretty decent one of the
better<00:06:17.420> ones<00:06:17.480> I've<00:06:17.840> used<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:18.290> I'd<00:06:19.010> probably

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
better ones I've used and I'd probably

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.160 
better ones I've used and I'd probably
give<00:06:19.400> it<00:06:19.430> an<00:06:19.670> eight<00:06:19.880> out<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.060> ten<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.540> we

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
give it an eight out of ten and we

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.420 
give it an eight out of ten and we
weren't<00:06:21.320> any<00:06:21.470> as<00:06:21.620> hang<00:06:21.830> games<00:06:22.040> as<00:06:22.190> well<00:06:22.310> so

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
weren't any as hang games as well so

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.540 
weren't any as hang games as well so
that's<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.640> bit<00:06:22.790> weird<00:06:23.260> but<00:06:24.260> yeah<00:06:24.550> definitely

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550
