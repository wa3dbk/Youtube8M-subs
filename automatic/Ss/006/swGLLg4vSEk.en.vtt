it
we<00:01:28.000> put<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.540> er<00:01:30.510> it's<00:01:31.510> actually<00:01:31.870> when

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
we put it in er it's actually when

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.160 
we put it in er it's actually when
you're<00:01:32.170> baking<00:01:32.440> without<00:01:33.100> gluten<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.170> it's

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
you're baking without gluten so it's

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.670 
you're baking without gluten so it's
good<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:35.440> have<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.800> sort<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.960> moist<00:01:37.960> you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
good to have it sort of like moist you

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.170 
good to have it sort of like moist you
don't<00:01:38.890> get<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.190> like<00:01:39.220> when<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.580> normally<00:01:39.729> bake

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
don't get it like when you normally bake

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.600 
don't get it like when you normally bake
like<00:01:40.390> bread<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:41.380> get<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.860> really<00:01:42.190> tight

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
like bread you get it like really tight

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.930 
like bread you get it like really tight
fit<00:01:43.270> but<00:01:44.229> when<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.860> are<00:01:44.950> not<00:01:45.009> having<00:01:45.400> gluten

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
fit but when you are not having gluten

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.630 
fit but when you are not having gluten
so<00:01:46.930> it's<00:01:47.290> better<00:01:47.530> when<00:01:48.070> it's<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.310> little<00:01:48.520> bit

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
so it's better when it's a little bit

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.350 
so it's better when it's a little bit
like<00:01:48.820> this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
like this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.469 
like this
so<00:01:50.110> it<00:01:50.320> tastes<00:01:50.920> better<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.520> it's<00:01:51.909> more<00:01:52.180> moist

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
so it tastes better and it's more moist

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.980 
so it tastes better and it's more moist
after<00:01:53.140> baking<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.710> so<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.479> why<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.780> looks

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
after baking it so that's why it looks

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.050 
after baking it so that's why it looks
like<00:01:56.200> it's<00:01:56.440> still<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:59.470> the<00:02:00.220> potato<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.850> for

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
like it's still and the potato is for

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.260 
like it's still and the potato is for
flavor<00:02:01.530> yeah<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.039> also<00:02:03.280> because<00:02:03.670> it

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
flavor yeah and it's also because it

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.320 
flavor yeah and it's also because it
gives<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.750> some<00:02:04.960> structure<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:06.520> potato

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
gives it some structure because potato

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.859 
gives it some structure because potato
is<00:02:07.539> sort<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.899> like<00:02:08.080> gluey<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.880> then<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.570> get<00:02:10.750> it

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
is sort of like gluey so then you get it

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.199 
is sort of like gluey so then you get it
better<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:16.750> garlic<00:02:17.019> downer<00:02:17.440> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
better you like to use garlic downer and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:28.300 
better you like to use garlic downer and
we<00:02:19.209> take<00:02:19.510> pieces<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:20.140> smoked<00:02:20.530> salmon

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.210 

hi

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:41.340 

little<00:02:32.850> bit<00:02:32.970> crunchies

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.500 

and<00:02:42.350> because<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.850> speech<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.240> quite

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
and because of that that speech is quite

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:59.600 
and because of that that speech is quite
salty<00:02:44.840> or<00:02:45.200> redfish

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.790 

like<00:03:00.180> about<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.600> cup<00:03:00.960> yeah<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:07.440> sort

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
like about a cup yeah so that it's sort

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:22.820 
like about a cup yeah so that it's sort
of<00:03:07.920> liquid<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:15.150> easier<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.720> pour<00:03:15.990> on<00:03:16.680> top

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:39.660 

to<00:03:23.250> keep<00:03:23.430> some<00:03:23.670> flavor

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.960 

and<00:03:40.270> this<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.069> make<00:03:42.190> it<00:03:42.250> look<00:03:42.490> nicer

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
