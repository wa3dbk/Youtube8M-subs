00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
just beat the game the game is based on

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.060 
just beat the game the game is based on
chapters<00:00:14.820> each<00:00:15.179> chapter<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.960> basically<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.619> one

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
chapters each chapter is basically a one

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.050 
chapters each chapter is basically a one
character<00:00:17.550> each<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:17.940> play<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:20.060> 16

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
character each so you play as 16

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
character each so you play as 16
characters<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.750> there's<00:00:21.960> 16<00:00:22.859> chapters<00:00:23.640> each

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
characters so there's 16 chapters each

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.080 
characters so there's 16 chapters each
chapter<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> each<00:00:26.070> character<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.640> fight

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
chapter so each character you fight

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.620 
chapter so each character you fight
about<00:00:27.359> four<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> five<00:00:27.869> times<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.670> based

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
about four to five times and then based

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
about four to five times and then based
on<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> guess<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
on how you do I guess it's like two to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.630 
on how you do I guess it's like two to
three<00:00:32.219> rounds<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.300> pretty<00:00:34.079> long<00:00:34.290> game

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
three rounds so it's a pretty long game

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
three rounds so it's a pretty long game
it's<00:00:35.640> somewhat<00:00:36.510> easy<00:00:36.780> only<00:00:37.290> character<00:00:38.219> which

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's somewhat easy only character which

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240 
it's somewhat easy only character which
gave<00:00:38.910> me<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.120> problem<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.750> um<00:00:39.930> Shang<00:00:40.890> soon
