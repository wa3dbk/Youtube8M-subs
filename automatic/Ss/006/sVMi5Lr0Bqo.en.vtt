00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 this is not an ordinary w 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.900
 this is the first known attempt 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 convert wind power into electricity 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.210
 by means of an inflatable balloon 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.380
 the wind must rotate it 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.000
 rotary air system fetus 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.699
 design imagination of this one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.710
 man fred farmer but he believes that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.080
 invented an alternative way of getting 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.040
 energy 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 the router is spinning like this but it just came out 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 but today Fred stands aside the main 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.309
 project engineer dr george is going through 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.680
 the occasion of the first launch ready on the body we 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.629
 account a little construction theory 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.219
 located at an altitude of 300 meters and because 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 spins the boiler coal ball which 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 rotates the turbine before the 3 senses go away 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 to the ground 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.780
 full-scale version is capable 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.579
 provide electricity to 800 homes and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.180
 become an alternative energy source 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.410
 in theory 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.390
 what we do is just take the ball and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 raise it above the ground we need 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.720
 man race clock to lose belly fat 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.910
 and tell us this is contrary to any 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 laws of physics 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.920
 so can not be the wind will not twist 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 wheel but no matter what he and we 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 we want to try but first the construction 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.539
 need to lift into the air without a gel this ball 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 hang like a little car with everyone 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:32.130
 generators sensors information with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.680
 sensors and temperature wind speed and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.410
 pressure inside the ball the nose protrudes on 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.479
 this computer 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.320
 one stand ready time to attach 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.179
 sensors need to put the module be 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.350
 put it on the left here and so much 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:52.259
 There will be about 10 good sensors on the left. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.789
 and so you need to fix this for now 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.789
 prototype we made it in a couple of hours 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.409
 disclosure as the main remote here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.479
 shooting turns them and arises 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.220
 electric current is kind of 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.810
 the counter he turns when through 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.049
 it passes the current so we will 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.230
 know how much energy 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:18.810
 each of these light bulbs was developed 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 300 watts each new light bulb 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.890
 will denote an additional 300 you 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.870
 but on the computer you can see more precisely 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.829
 it's just simple and visual 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.049
 way to display the amount of energy 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.049
 they were almost ready to launch but suddenly 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.450
 what happened 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.580
 an unexpected problem arose something 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:48.240
 scratching us think we found that 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.920
 and if this roller fills the balloon 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.540
 it means something is wrong with the design 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.770
 huge size balls force of wind bent 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.360
 bracket that holds back 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.540
 metal support which became 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.140
 rub the usa soon on the other side 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.120
 there was the same problem you need to fix 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.580
 supports have not yet broken into the stone and behold 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.500
 the problem is fixed for her today 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.570
 buoy as often happens when I invent 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.880
 something new that no one ever did 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.390
 up in the world is full of balloons but they 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.460
 not spinning here we wanted to check 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.280
 him today but unfortunately it is us 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.280
 we failed it is necessary 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.530
 it will definitely happen no matter 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.750
 how much time will pass we firmly decided 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.220
 bring it to the end and we will not give up 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.220
 come back tomorrow
