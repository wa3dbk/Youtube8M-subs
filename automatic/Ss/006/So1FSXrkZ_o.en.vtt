00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.119 

just<00:00:50.489> parked<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.660> been<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.170> happened<00:00:52.590> a

goes the door no I I don't I don't

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.210 
goes the door no I I don't I don't
understand<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> wire<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
understand if it's if it's the wire the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.620 
understand if it's if it's the wire the
wires<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.560> crossed<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.630> there's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
wires are just crossed and and there's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.390 
wires are just crossed and and there's
currents<00:01:19.290> getting<00:01:19.619> crazy<00:01:20.040> between<00:01:20.700> them

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
currents getting crazy between them

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
currents getting crazy between them
there's<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.850> activity<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
there's a lot of activity in this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.719 
there's a lot of activity in this
dashboard<00:01:26.000> right<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.130> past<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.640> was

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
dashboard right now in the past I was

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.590 
dashboard right now in the past I was
unplugging<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.479> dashboard<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.270> seemed

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
unplugging the dashboard and that seemed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.730 
unplugging the dashboard and that seemed
to<00:01:36.630> stop<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to stop it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.910 
to stop it
turn<00:01:38.250> off<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> lights<00:01:39.439> to<00:01:40.439> turn<00:01:40.590> off<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
turn off all the lights to turn off the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
turn off all the lights to turn off the
speedometer<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> everything<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> that's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
speedometer and everything and that's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
speedometer and everything and that's
just<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.149> mean<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> motor<00:01:48.689> where<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.020> works

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
just I mean the motor where it works

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
just I mean the motor where it works
fine<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:53.250> just

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
fine and all that it's it's it's just

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.219 
fine and all that it's it's it's just
this<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.710> dashboard<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.670> seems<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.180> be

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
this this dashboard that seems to be

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.920 
this this dashboard that seems to be
tripping<00:01:58.229> off<00:01:58.409> quite<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> bit<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.930> research

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
tripping off quite a bit and a research

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.310 
tripping off quite a bit and a research
tell<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.520> replace<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.600> dashboard<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
tell you could replace the dashboard and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
tell you could replace the dashboard and
then<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.619> mean<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:05.549> talking<00:02:05.759> about<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
then I mean we're we're talking about a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.839 
then I mean we're we're talking about a
lot<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> work<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> lot<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.039> money<00:02:08.399> beyond

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
lot of work and a lot of money beyond

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.240 
lot of work and a lot of money beyond
what<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.209> pay

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
what I can pay

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.400 
what I can pay
but<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.760> don't<00:02:11.820> need<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.420> battery

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but I don't I don't need this battery

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.260 
but I don't I don't need this battery
being<00:02:13.770> drained<00:02:14.250> by<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> dashboard<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:18.060> much

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
being drained by the dashboard so much

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.940 
being drained by the dashboard so much
it's<00:02:19.460> really<00:02:20.460> uh<00:02:20.490> really<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.600> pain<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.320> seems<00:02:22.800> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it's really uh really a pain it seems to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.550 
it's really uh really a pain it seems to
blow<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.670> batteries<00:02:24.210> my<00:02:25.020> batteries<00:02:25.410> only

warranties and this the there was like

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.390 
warranties and this the there was like
fuel<00:02:31.500> cells<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.370> blown<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:34.350> don't<00:02:35.340> know

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
fuel cells I got blown out I don't know

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:49.870 
fuel cells I got blown out I don't know
if<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.580> could<00:02:35.730> really<00:02:35.910> show<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:47.450> that's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
if I could really show it that's

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.380 
if I could really show it that's
electrical<00:02:51.350> grid<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.740> think<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.610> could<00:02:53.790> feel<00:02:54.090> it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
electrical grid I think I could feel it

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.800 
electrical grid I think I could feel it
maybe<00:02:55.490> I'm<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:56.550> gonna<00:02:56.820> record<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.600> how

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
maybe I'm just gonna record to see how

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.410 
maybe I'm just gonna record to see how
often<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.380> beeps<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:59.160> should<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.240> able<00:03:00.300> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
often this beeps I should be able to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.480 
often this beeps I should be able to
feel<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.350> because<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.590> remember<00:03:01.650> where<00:03:02.220> the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
feel for it because I remember where the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.620 
feel for it because I remember where the
dashboard<00:03:03.830> one<00:03:04.830> is<00:03:05.040> yep<00:03:05.490> right<00:03:05.880> right<00:03:06.300> there

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
