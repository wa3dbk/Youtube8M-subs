00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.450
 The disposition affects how your team will attack, defend and hold the ball. 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.150
 Try one of the introduced formations depending on your preferred playing style. 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.890
 4-1-2-1-2 is probably the most balanced FIFA 15 formation. 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.779
 With this Ultimate Team favorite, you have plenty of offensive options. 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.449
 You can attack the wings with the left and right midfielder, sending deadly passes into the middle offensive run 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 midfielder and eventually decorate everything with two quality attackers. 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 Key positions are SDZ and SOZ: 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.789
 The SDZ can pull in defense, disrupt the opponent's game, and generally strengthen your defensive line. 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 This position is also important when creating a game. Therefore, look for players with good defense statistics 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.640
 and a good pass. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 Even your KOS must pass well, as one of his tasks will be to send the attackers to the end. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.500
 He will also go up to 16 or search for shots from a distance, 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.780
 therefore do not forget about a good shot. 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 4-3-2-1 can be described as some sort of offensive trident with three attackers on top. 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.560
 Left and right attackers complete the top player in the assault chariot. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.960
 They can run into the lime from the sides and exchange positions with the tip. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.700
 This will confuse your opponent, who will not know whether to guard the center of the course or his side. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.720
 You can also rely on a solid four-piece defense while a compact three-piece backup stands out 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 in short passes and game creation. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 4-3-3 (2) is suitable for those who prefer to attack, revel 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.200
 in counterattacks and they like to spread wide wings. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 You can send long passes to your opponent's 16 on your wing players 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.380
 and then run into lime, where you try to shoot, or center on your tip player. 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 This disposition also offers a good balance of ambush in terms of attacking and defending. 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 The SZ-SDZ-SZ triangle is great if you want to hold the ball. 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.450
 The key point is the SDE, which can boost your centerline or 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.150
 help defensively. 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.320
 3-5-2 offers a wide range of offensive options - you can support two attackers in the front 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.579
 left and right midfielder and offensive midfielder. Five attacking midfielder will not leave 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.579
 your opponent has almost no time to get a good start, and once you get the ball you have a lot of options 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.199
 who to pass. 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:31.850
 As far as defense is concerned, this disposition has two mid-defensive midfielders who can help out 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.840
 middle defenders in need. And not to mention the fact that two withdrawal midfielder beats opponents 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.120
 attacks, hold the ball if necessary, and then move it forward. 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.949
 You will be vulnerable to wing attacks, so try to create your own tactics 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:51.949
 in which the extreme defenders will play more widely. Your two SDEs may become a SO in the event of an opponent's attack. 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.570
 We have outlined just a few dispositions. Remember that you can edit each one further 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.230
 and set specific tasks for players in the Team Management menu. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.230
