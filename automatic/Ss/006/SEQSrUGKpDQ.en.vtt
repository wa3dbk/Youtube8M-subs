00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
liked him in central defensive midfield

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.170 
liked him in central defensive midfield
but<00:03:09.900> I'm<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.410> too<00:03:10.560> sure<00:03:10.830> his<00:03:11.400> inform<00:03:11.850> haven't

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
but I'm not too sure his inform haven't

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.150 
but I'm not too sure his inform haven't
tried<00:03:12.360> them<00:03:12.450> out<00:03:12.540> yet<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:13.380> these<00:03:13.650> two<00:03:13.950> players

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
tried them out yet now these two players

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.550 
tried them out yet now these two players
right<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.550> we<00:03:14.730> did<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> review<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.510> them<00:03:15.810> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
right here we did a review on them I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.890 
right here we did a review on them I
think<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.400> could<00:03:17.550> play<00:03:17.760> them<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:18.690> use

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
think you could play them and just use

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.420 
think you could play them and just use
them<00:03:19.050> for<00:03:19.230> fun<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> wouldn't<00:03:20.190> really<00:03:20.280> use

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
them for fun but I wouldn't really use

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.890 
them for fun but I wouldn't really use
them<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:20.850> you're<00:03:20.970> playing<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.330> serious<00:03:21.690> matter

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
them if you're playing a serious matter

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.780 
them if you're playing a serious matter
if<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.200> liked<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> wage<00:03:23.130> or<00:03:23.400> anything<00:03:23.760> like

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
if you liked in a wage or anything like

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.220 
if you liked in a wage or anything like
that<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.570> you're<00:03:24.660> just<00:03:24.810> messing<00:03:25.140> around

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
