00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.410 
product is we've got an e-reader but
what<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.740> try<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:13.950> do<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
what we try to do is make it so got a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.140 
what we try to do is make it so got a
lot<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.190> now<00:00:17.279> got<00:00:17.520> ereader

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
lot more about it so for now got ereader

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.570 
lot more about it so for now got ereader
like<00:00:18.810> internet<00:00:19.439> lot<00:00:20.510> media<00:00:21.510> sync<00:00:21.779> music

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
like internet lot media sync music

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
like internet lot media sync music
photos<00:00:23.779> video<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.400> apps<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:28.260> run<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
photos video so an apps so we run on a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
photos video so an apps so we run on a
window<00:00:29.189> seat<00:00:29.460> platform<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.210> moment<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:30.660> we

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
window seat platform at moment but we

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.870 
window seat platform at moment but we
also<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.230> android<00:00:31.560> system<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
also have an android system that we can

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720 
also have an android system that we can
bring<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> system<00:00:33.690> later<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.550> has<00:00:35.550> an

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
bring into the system later on has an

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
bring into the system later on has an
accelerometer<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.690> Lex<00:00:36.960> our<00:00:37.110> ancestor<00:00:37.590> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
accelerometer as Lex our ancestor you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.200 
accelerometer as Lex our ancestor you
can<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:38.030> for<00:00:39.030> poor<00:00:39.360> access<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.840> salsa<00:00:41.210> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
can go for poor access some salsa the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
can go for poor access some salsa the
stage<00:00:42.450> very<00:00:42.690> quick<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.469> working<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.040> our<00:00:44.190> code

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
stage very quick is working on our code

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
stage very quick is working on our code
11<00:00:45.270> processes<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.050> 1<00:00:46.469> gigahertz<00:00:46.829> processor<00:00:48.079> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
11 processes so 1 gigahertz processor so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.740 
11 processes so 1 gigahertz processor so
for<00:00:49.230> example<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.129> ereader

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
for example if we going to our ereader

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
for example if we going to our ereader
you<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.199> we've<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.590> touch<00:00:53.010> screen

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you see here we've got touch screen

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.680 
you see here we've got touch screen
again<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.449> library<00:00:55.850> choose

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
again for our library choose

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.549 
again for our library choose
and<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:01.059> obviously<00:01:01.870> when<00:01:02.019> you<00:01:02.109> read<00:01:02.260> in<00:01:02.440> this

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
and what obviously when you read in this

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.009 
and what obviously when you read in this
very<00:01:02.800> personal<00:01:03.399> so<00:01:04.330> you<00:01:04.449> can<00:01:04.629> play<00:01:04.780> one<00:01:04.930> of

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
very personal so you can play one of

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.770 
very personal so you can play one of
Paige's<00:01:05.770> up<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.549> down<00:01:06.729> we<00:01:07.180> mourn<00:01:07.360> over<00:01:07.509> left

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
Paige's up and down we mourn over left

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.930 
Paige's up and down we mourn over left
to<00:01:08.049> right<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:09.009> software<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.400> very<00:01:09.460> regular

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
to right the software is very regular

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.850 
to right the software is very regular
rate<00:01:10.150> now<00:01:10.900> what<00:01:11.080> do<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.200> need<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.409> do<00:01:11.619> with<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
rate now what do you need to do with the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.940 
rate now what do you need to do with the
software<00:01:12.690> software<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:14.049> this<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.350> using<00:01:14.920> that

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
software software so this is using that

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.039 
software software so this is using that
totally<00:01:15.399> our<00:01:15.520> own<00:01:15.670> reader<00:01:15.940> so<00:01:16.240> Serena<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:16.899> we

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
totally our own reader so Serena this we

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.680 
totally our own reader so Serena this we

from<00:01:19.960> called<00:01:20.170> erm<00:01:20.649> do<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:20.890> want<00:01:21.040> to<00:01:21.100> show<00:01:21.220> in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
from called erm do you want to show in

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.070 
from called erm do you want to show in
town<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.700> looks<00:01:21.909> they<00:01:22.570> can't<00:01:22.780> think<00:01:22.930> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
town I looks they can't think the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.850 
town I looks they can't think the
barriers<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.680> stuff<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.009> death<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:26.740> is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
barriers and stuff and death so this is

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.279 
barriers and stuff and death so this is
a<00:01:26.890> handmade<00:01:27.310> kind<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.729> prototype<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:28.659> this<00:01:29.170> is

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
a handmade kind of prototype so this is

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.469 
a handmade kind of prototype so this is
a<00:01:29.470> ship<00:01:29.799> all<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.190> action<00:01:30.729> ready<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.030> go<00:01:31.179> so

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
a ship all the action ready to go so

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.109 
a ship all the action ready to go so
it's<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.720> going<00:01:31.899> through<00:01:32.110> Tesla<00:01:32.530> moments<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
it's just going through Tesla moments so

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.450 
it's just going through Tesla moments so
you<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:34.360> see<00:01:34.509> we've<00:01:34.659> got<00:01:35.070> three<00:01:36.070> thousand

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
you can see we've got three thousand

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.130 
you can see we've got three thousand
many<00:01:36.580> hours<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.909> battery<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.960> means

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
many hours of battery so that means

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.919 
many hours of battery so that means
we've<00:01:38.319> got<00:01:38.500> 10<00:01:38.860> hours<00:01:39.069> a<00:01:39.580> full<00:01:40.030> video<00:01:40.420> way<00:01:40.690> back

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
we've got 10 hours a full video way back

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.649 
we've got 10 hours a full video way back
right<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:44.409> what<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.800> varies<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.550> that<00:01:45.819> why

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
right kind what is it varies is that why

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.820 
right kind what is it varies is that why
batteries<00:01:47.319> itself<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.130> very<00:01:48.159> good<00:01:49.149> for<00:01:49.360> you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
batteries itself is very good for you

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.100 
batteries itself is very good for you
under<00:01:50.830> 50<00:01:51.100> grams<00:01:51.130> over<00:01:51.460> there<00:01:51.759> is<00:01:52.509> a<00:01:52.539> nice<00:01:52.780> part

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
under 50 grams over there is a nice part

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.770 
under 50 grams over there is a nice part
of<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.289> Florida<00:01:53.649> swim<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.220> then<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.600> have

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
of the Florida swim and then you have

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.350 
of the Florida swim and then you have
you<00:01:56.590> call<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.429> processor<00:01:57.819> it's<00:01:58.210> a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
you call this this is a processor it's a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.249 
you call this this is a processor it's a
processor<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.409> code<00:01:59.619> in<00:02:00.090> 11<00:02:01.090> processor<00:02:01.659> it

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
processor so the code in 11 processor it

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.930 
processor so the code in 11 processor it
says<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.560> linux<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.099> procedure<00:02:03.429> subscribe

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
says a linux on the procedure subscribe

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.290 
says a linux on the procedure subscribe
could<00:02:04.780> eat<00:02:05.050> so<00:02:05.649> this<00:02:05.800> is<00:02:05.830> your<00:02:05.979> processor<00:02:06.700> arm

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
could eat so this is your processor arm

11 or 11 and 1 gigahertz this is your

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.010 
11 or 11 and 1 gigahertz this is your
design<00:02:12.220> yeah<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.849> you're<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.840> using

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
design yeah and you're just using

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.780 
design yeah and you're just using
yourself<00:02:14.319> or<00:02:14.709> anybody<00:02:14.890> else<00:02:15.160> using<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.580> or

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
yourself or anybody else using it or

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.170 
yourself or anybody else using it or
it's<00:02:16.720> time<00:02:17.260> proves<00:02:18.129> if<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.430> our<00:02:18.580> own<00:02:18.700> process

it's time proves if of our own process

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's time proves if of our own process
so<00:02:19.390> nobody<00:02:19.690> else<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.410> using<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.709> at<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.890> moment

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so nobody else is using it at the moment

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.809

yeah<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.830> most<00:02:38.010> obviously<00:02:38.340> we're<00:02:38.520> dropping

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
yeah the most obviously we're dropping

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.940 
yeah the most obviously we're dropping
of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.330> motion<00:02:40.200> on<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> give<00:02:40.709> us<00:02:40.800> more

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of the motion on that to give us more

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.890 
of the motion on that to give us more
battery<00:02:41.340> life<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:42.240> obviously<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.720> only

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
battery life but obviously that only

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.330 
battery life but obviously that only
switches<00:02:43.319> off<00:02:43.440> when<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.830> go<00:02:44.010> onto<00:02:44.190> the

febrian sleeve as well we have two gig
of<00:02:50.550> dams<00:02:51.180> storage<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:53.330> 256<00:02:54.330> meg<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.959> ram<00:02:55.590> which

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
of dams storage and 256 meg of ram which

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.650 
of dams storage and 256 meg of ram which
is<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:57.830> weather<00:02:58.830> these<00:02:59.010> two<00:02:59.420> people<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> have

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
is this weather these two people to have

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.020 
is this weather these two people to have
to<00:03:00.810> start<00:03:01.020> social<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.680> our<00:03:01.739> memory<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.790> then

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
to start social and our memory and then

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.660 
to start social and our memory and then
so<00:03:03.420> there<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.750> two<00:03:03.959> gig<00:03:04.110> stitute<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:05.310> work

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
so there is a two gig stitute to work

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.670 
so there is a two gig stitute to work
its<00:03:05.880> or<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.510> how<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.720> do<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.110> that's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
its or is that how you do see that's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.830 
its or is that how you do see that's
just<00:03:07.739> want<00:03:07.980> module<00:03:08.280> that's<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
just want module that's the right and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.120 
just want module that's the right and
there's<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.440> how<00:03:10.560> much<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.920> going<00:03:11.070> to

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
there's so how much is this going to

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
there's so how much is this going to
cast<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.519> when<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.880> make<00:03:12.030> them<00:03:12.180> at<00:03:12.300> least<00:03:12.420> ok

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
cast it when is it make them at least ok

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.229 
cast it when is it make them at least ok
so<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:14.220> be<00:03:14.480> restocked<00:03:15.480> over<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.900> year<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:18.090> see

their<00:03:25.350> retail<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.430> products<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:26.970> arrived

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
their retail in this products we arrived

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.860 
their retail in this products we arrived
at<00:03:27.269> 179<00:03:28.250> euro<00:03:29.250> euro<00:03:30.150> paranoia<00:03:30.810> europe<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:33.720> this

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
at 179 euro euro paranoia europe so this

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.390 
at 179 euro euro paranoia europe so this
is<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.110> color<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.560> leader<00:03:35.870> strategy<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:38.250> it's

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
is the color a leader strategy that it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.120 
is the color a leader strategy that it's
resistive<00:03:38.970> touch<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.959> touch<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.100> a

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
resistive touch just to touch we have a

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.610 
resistive touch just to touch we have a
plastic<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.120> developments<00:03:42.959> were

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
plastic one and developments were

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.950 
plastic one and developments were
released<00:03:43.920> with<00:03:44.180> resistive<00:03:45.180> first

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
released with resistive first

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.630 
released with resistive first
so<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.440> because<00:03:46.740> villa<00:03:47.070> c<00:03:47.250> is<00:03:47.400> going<00:03:47.580> to

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
so this is because villa c is going to

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.610 
so this is because villa c is going to
be<00:03:47.730> 0<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.150> opera<00:03:48.510> yeah<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.320> actually
