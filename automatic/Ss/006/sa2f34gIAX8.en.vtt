for<00:00:56.500> deciding<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.700> learn<00:00:58.700> a<00:00:59.030> little<00:00:59.360> bit<00:00:59.450> more

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
for deciding to learn a little bit more

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.889 
for deciding to learn a little bit more
about<00:00:59.930> medical<00:01:00.380> device<00:01:00.649> reporting<00:01:01.630> but<00:01:02.630> I

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
about medical device reporting but I

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.139 
about medical device reporting but I
think<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.380> easiest<00:01:03.860> way<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.220> begin<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.940> do

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
think the easiest way to begin to do

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.260 
think the easiest way to begin to do
this<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:05.869> since<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.860> can't<00:01:07.190> see<00:01:07.280> your<00:01:07.640> face<00:01:07.910> I

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
this is since I can't see your face I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.600 
this is since I can't see your face I
want<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.930> work<00:01:09.080> with<00:01:09.259> your<00:01:09.410> mind<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.580> I

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
want to work with your mind and so I

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.130 
want to work with your mind and so I
want<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.240> look<00:01:11.420> at<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.720> as<00:01:11.960> we're<00:01:12.110> just

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
want to look at this as we're just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.130 
want to look at this as we're just
basically<00:01:12.560> going<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.130> take<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.369> field<00:01:13.729> trip

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
basically going to take a field trip

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.010 
basically going to take a field trip
through<00:01:15.140> medical<00:01:15.649> device<00:01:15.920> reporting<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.539> so

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
through medical device reporting and so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.890 
through medical device reporting and so
what<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.200> want<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.560> do<00:01:19.220> just<00:01:19.479> metaphorically<00:01:20.479> is

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
what I want to do just metaphorically is

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.440 
what I want to do just metaphorically is
have<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.860> sort<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.159> step<00:01:22.520> back<00:01:22.549> from<00:01:23.299> all<00:01:23.420> of

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
have you sort of step back from all of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.960 
have you sort of step back from all of
the<00:01:23.690> individual<00:01:24.440> ideas<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.190> requirements<00:01:25.880> of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
the individual ideas and requirements of

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.420 
the individual ideas and requirements of
medical<00:01:26.360> device<00:01:26.630> reporting<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.530> understand

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
medical device reporting and understand

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.550 
medical device reporting and understand
first<00:01:28.760> that<00:01:28.909> we<00:01:29.090> need<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.510> look<00:01:29.990> at<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.200> forest

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
first that we need to look at a forest

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.520 
first that we need to look at a forest
in<00:01:30.860> terms<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.220> what<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.580> is<00:01:31.729> trying<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> do

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
in terms of what this is trying to do

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.590 
in terms of what this is trying to do
and<00:01:33.530> then<00:01:33.860> look<00:01:34.610> at<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.850> requirements<00:01:35.570> that

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
and then look at the requirements that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.780 
and then look at the requirements that
you<00:01:35.869> have<00:01:36.110> as<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.470> go<00:01:36.650> through<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.159> forest

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
you have as you go through this forest

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.460 
you have as you go through this forest
and<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.270> would<00:01:38.420> be<00:01:38.630> working<00:01:39.229> with<00:01:39.260> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
and that would be working with the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.760 
and that would be working with the
individual<00:01:40.070> trees<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:42.049> let's<00:01:42.260> go<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.590> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
individual trees so let's go on to the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.330 
individual trees so let's go on to the
first<00:01:43.100> slide<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.380> here<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.500> can<00:01:45.650> see<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.159> in

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
first slide and here you can see just in

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.640 
first slide and here you can see just in
terms<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.880> landscape<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:48.049> what<00:01:48.439> this

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
terms of the landscape of what this

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.390 
terms of the landscape of what this
regulatory<00:01:49.280> requirement<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.890> it's<00:01:51.890> based<00:01:52.189> on

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
regulatory requirement is it's based on

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.730 
regulatory requirement is it's based on
the<00:01:52.580> statute<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.450> course<00:01:53.689> statutes<00:01:54.590> are

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.659 
follow the rules that are in the statute
then<00:04:29.290> you're<00:04:29.440> prohibited<00:04:29.650> from<00:04:30.100> putting<00:04:30.550> that

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
then you're prohibited from putting that

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.410 
then you're prohibited from putting that
device<00:04:31.150> into

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
device into

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.150 
device into
and<00:04:32.510> then<00:04:33.140> we<00:04:33.260> have<00:04:33.560> all<00:04:33.740> sorts<00:04:34.100> of

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
and then we have all sorts of

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.740 
and then we have all sorts of
enforcement<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.000> that's<00:04:35.180> how<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.390> statute

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
enforcement so that's how the statute

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.350 
enforcement so that's how the statute
lays<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.890> out<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.160> landscape<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.180> what

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
lays it out the landscape this is what

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.500 
lays it out the landscape this is what
you<00:04:38.510> have<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.900> do<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:40.370> violates<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.090> law<00:04:41.240> if

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
you have to do it violates the law if

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.510 
you have to do it violates the law if
you<00:04:41.630> don't<00:04:41.840> do<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:42.710> FDA<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.280> going<00:04:43.340> to

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
you don't do it and then FDA is going to

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.410 
you don't do it and then FDA is going to
take<00:04:43.760> its<00:04:43.940> standard<00:04:44.770> enforcement<00:04:45.770> actions<00:04:46.420> so

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
take its standard enforcement actions so

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.960 
take its standard enforcement actions so
let's<00:04:47.630> go<00:04:47.780> on<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.260> next<00:04:48.500> slide<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.880> you

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
let's go on to the next slide and so you

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.240 
let's go on to the next slide and so you
can<00:04:50.090> begin<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.390> see<00:04:50.510> how<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.250> regulation

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
can begin to see how the regulation

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.670 
can begin to see how the regulation
actually<00:04:53.180> operates<00:04:53.780> out<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.080> course<00:04:54.350> Congress

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
actually operates out of course Congress

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.580 
actually operates out of course Congress
broke<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> laws<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.880> FDA<00:04:56.470> promulgates<00:04:57.470> the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
broke the laws and FDA promulgates the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.530 
broke the laws and FDA promulgates the
regulation<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.550> explain<00:04:58.970> how<00:04:59.180> we're<00:04:59.360> going<00:04:59.480> to

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
regulation to explain how we're going to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.370 
regulation to explain how we're going to
implement<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.530> law<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.360> basically<00:05:02.900> in<00:05:03.140> real

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
implement the law so basically in real

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.790 
implement the law so basically in real
blunt<00:05:03.860> terms<00:05:04.250> how<00:05:04.730> FDA<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:05.870> populated<00:05:06.650> this

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
blunt terms how FDA is populated this

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
blunt terms how FDA is populated this
forest<00:05:07.340> with<00:05:07.550> trees<00:05:07.970> is<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:09.700> for<00:05:10.700> this

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
forest with trees is that for this

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.730 
forest with trees is that for this
particular<00:05:11.000> area<00:05:11.870> we<00:05:12.050> want<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.470> tell<00:05:12.710> us

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
particular area we want you to tell us

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.350 
particular area we want you to tell us
the<00:05:13.010> bad<00:05:13.190> things<00:05:13.490> that<00:05:13.610> have<00:05:13.760> happened<00:05:13.790> and

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
the bad things that have happened and

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.840 
the bad things that have happened and
those<00:05:15.350> bad<00:05:15.650> things<00:05:15.950> are<00:05:16.190> put<00:05:16.370> into<00:05:16.520> three

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
those bad things are put into three

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.660 
those bad things are put into three
categories
