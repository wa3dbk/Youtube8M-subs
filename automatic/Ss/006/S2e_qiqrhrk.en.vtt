00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
I was pretty involved with some negative

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.330 
I was pretty involved with some negative
influences<00:02:07.720> before<00:02:08.229> feast<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:08.860> through

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
influences before feast and through

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.430 
influences before feast and through
feast<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.880> realized<00:02:10.330> what<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:10.840> doing<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.290> my

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
feast I realized what I'm doing to my

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.970 
feast I realized what I'm doing to my
body<00:02:11.590> we<00:02:12.100> gather<00:02:12.430> around<00:02:13.330> food<00:02:13.930> family<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
community and I think that's what

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.180 
community and I think that's what

through<00:02:21.160> feast<00:02:21.460> feast<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:22.060> part<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
through feast feast is part of a

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.540 
through feast feast is part of a
movement<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.620> change<00:02:23.890> that's<00:02:24.070> happening

all<00:02:24.730> over<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.030> world<00:02:25.150> right<00:02:25.450> now<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.660> think

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
all over the world right now I think

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
all over the world right now I think
there<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.560> an<00:02:26.950> awakening<00:02:27.820> towards<00:02:28.390> what
