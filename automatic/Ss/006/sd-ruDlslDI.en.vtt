the<00:01:46.110> iSchool<00:01:46.380> crash<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.890> case<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the iSchool crash just in case you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.330 
the iSchool crash just in case you
didn't<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> switch<00:01:47.610> out

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
didn't want to switch out

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.800 
didn't want to switch out
no<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:49.789> really<00:01:50.060> share<00:01:50.329> what<00:01:50.479> he<00:01:50.539> would<00:01:50.659> switch

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
no I really share what he would switch

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.569 
no I really share what he would switch
out<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.560> wouldn't<00:01:51.770> really<00:01:52.070> be<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.340> smart

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
out to it wouldn't really be the smart

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.919 
out to it wouldn't really be the smart
move<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.119> good<00:01:53.299> thing<00:01:53.359> that<00:01:53.600> he<00:01:53.689> stated

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
move so it's a good thing that he stated

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.039 
move so it's a good thing that he stated
actually<00:01:54.619> yeah<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:55.789> I'm<00:01:56.479> not<00:01:56.539> gonna<00:01:56.719> take<00:01:56.899> out

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
actually yeah and I'm not gonna take out

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.510 
actually yeah and I'm not gonna take out
his<00:01:57.140> Tyranitar<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.859> like<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.100> said<00:01:58.159> he<00:01:58.399> has

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
his Tyranitar and like I said he has

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.859 
his Tyranitar and like I said he has
nothing<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.850> prevent<00:01:59.090> me<00:01:59.240> from<00:01:59.270> getting<00:01:59.539> in<00:01:59.780> my

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
nothing to prevent me from getting in my

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.539 
nothing to prevent me from getting in my
style<00:02:00.109> drugs<00:02:00.350> seeing<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:01.069> how<00:02:01.189> I<00:02:01.219> have<00:02:01.429> the

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
style drugs seeing as how I have the

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.069 
style drugs seeing as how I have the
focus<00:02:01.729> ass<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.240> anyways<00:02:02.539> he's<00:02:02.719> gonna<00:02:02.840> go<00:02:02.990> out

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
focus ass but anyways he's gonna go out

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.859 
focus ass but anyways he's gonna go out
to<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> scissors<00:02:03.530> over<00:02:03.619> here<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.420> I

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
to a scissors over here and to my I

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.179 
to a scissors over here and to my I
don't<00:02:06.140> know<00:02:06.200> surprised<00:02:06.679> he<00:02:06.890> didn't<00:02:07.100> go

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
don't know surprised he didn't go

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.440 
don't know surprised he didn't go
straight<00:02:07.429> for<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.610> bullet<00:02:07.909> punch<00:02:08.060> he<00:02:08.269> goes

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
straight for the bullet punch he goes

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.660 
straight for the bullet punch he goes
for<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.690> swords<00:02:09.049> dance<00:02:09.200> before<00:02:09.670> attempting

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
for the swords dance before attempting

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.640 
for the swords dance before attempting
to<00:02:10.759> kill<00:02:10.970> me<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.959> guess<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.260> makes<00:02:12.410> sense

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
to kill me and I guess it makes sense

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.020 
to kill me and I guess it makes sense
because<00:02:12.739> megasis<00:02:13.280> or<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.519> really<00:02:13.730> really

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
because megasis or is really really

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
because megasis or is really really
bulky<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.480> he<00:02:14.629> hadn't<00:02:14.930> mega<00:02:15.049> evolve<00:02:15.379> he<00:02:15.470> would

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
bulky if he hadn't mega evolve he would

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.680 
bulky if he hadn't mega evolve he would
have<00:02:15.709> taken<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:16.010> clean<00:02:16.430> half<00:02:16.849> damage<00:02:17.360> from<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
have taken a clean half damage from the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.050 
have taken a clean half damage from the
earthquake<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:18.349> about<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.010> use<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:20.000> you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
earthquake that I'm about to use but you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.550 
earthquake that I'm about to use but you
guys<00:02:20.180> are<00:02:20.269> gonna<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.569> he<00:02:20.780> actually<00:02:21.349> only

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
guys are gonna see he actually only

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.880 
guys are gonna see he actually only
takes<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.420> 40<00:02:23.420> percent<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.470> guess<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
takes like 40 percent so I guess it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.440 
takes like 40 percent so I guess it
makes<00:02:25.040> sense<00:02:25.280> because<00:02:25.730> either<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.269> would

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
makes sense because either way I would

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.640 
makes sense because either way I would
have<00:02:26.540> ended<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> excellent<00:02:27.349> notice<00:02:27.530> not

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
have ended up the excellent notice not

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.809 
have ended up the excellent notice not
sure<00:02:27.799> I<00:02:27.829> wouldn't<00:02:28.040> have<00:02:28.160> ended<00:02:28.370> up<00:02:28.549> getting<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
sure I wouldn't have ended up getting a

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.250 
sure I wouldn't have ended up getting a
hit<00:02:28.970> off<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> Fiat<00:02:29.630> dismount<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.049> Pullip

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
hit off on a Fiat dismount for Pullip

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.539 
hit off on a Fiat dismount for Pullip
enterprise<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.920> think<00:02:31.160> he<00:02:31.310> should<00:02:31.519> have

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
enterprise but I think he should have

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.460 
enterprise but I think he should have
done<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.000> honest<00:02:32.299> but<00:02:32.840> either<00:02:33.110> way<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.319> get

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
done to be honest but either way I get

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.720 
done to be honest but either way I get
my<00:02:33.650> rocks<00:02:33.829> and<00:02:34.220> I'm<00:02:34.310> gonna<00:02:34.430> live<00:02:34.579> with<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
my rocks and I'm gonna live with the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.600 
my rocks and I'm gonna live with the
focus<00:02:35.000> ass<00:02:35.560> like<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.829> said<00:02:37.040> like<00:02:37.190> 40<00:02:37.489> percent

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
focus ass like I said like 40 percent

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.479 
focus ass like I said like 40 percent
great<00:02:38.150> quick<00:02:38.420> uh<00:02:38.900> he<00:02:39.379> had<00:02:39.650> used<00:02:39.829> roost<00:02:40.280> or

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
great quick uh he had used roost or

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.559 
great quick uh he had used roost or
something<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:41.000> would<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.209> made<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> little

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
something it would have made a little

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.930 
something it would have made a little
more<00:02:41.690> sense<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.200> me<00:02:42.319> but<00:02:43.129> then<00:02:43.400> again<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.700> didn't

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
more sense to me but then again I didn't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.280 
more sense to me but then again I didn't
even<00:02:44.030> bring<00:02:44.150> him<00:02:44.299> below<00:02:44.510> half<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:44.930> he<00:02:45.019> had<00:02:45.140> no

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
even bring him below half so he had no

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.110 
even bring him below half so he had no
reason<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.709> even<00:02:45.739> grow<00:02:46.129> food<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.579> just<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.060> just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
reason to even grow food I just I just

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.550 
reason to even grow food I just I just
don't<00:02:47.299> think<00:02:47.569> using<00:02:47.720> Swords<00:02:48.140> Dance<00:02:48.170> was<00:02:48.440> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
don't think using Swords Dance was the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.660 
don't think using Swords Dance was the
right<00:02:48.739> move<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.190> because<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.640> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
right move there because I have a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.319 
right move there because I have a
Volcarona

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
Volcarona

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.330 
Volcarona
I<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.989> things<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.379> take<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.860> steel<00:02:52.069> type

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
I have things to take a steel type

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.729 
I have things to take a steel type
bullet<00:02:52.819> punch<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.900> my<00:02:54.049> excadrill<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:54.709> I

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
bullet punch like my excadrill here I

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.890 
bullet punch like my excadrill here I
could<00:02:54.920> definitely<00:02:55.519> take<00:02:56.030> his<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> megacities

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
could definitely take his a megacities

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.660 
could definitely take his a megacities
around<00:02:57.109> with<00:02:57.200> my<00:02:57.290> excadrill<00:02:57.590> extra<00:02:58.370> do<00:02:58.489> does

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
around with my excadrill extra do does

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.370 
around with my excadrill extra do does
have<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.819> lot<00:02:59.000> more<00:02:59.030> attack<00:02:59.480> than<00:02:59.690> my<00:02:59.870> mammoths

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
have a lot more attack than my mammoths

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.870 
have a lot more attack than my mammoths
on<00:03:00.470> my<00:03:00.590> malice<00:03:00.829> -<00:03:01.069> jolly<00:03:01.280> mike<00:03:01.549> circles

on my malice - jolly mike circles

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.340 
on my malice - jolly mike circles
adamant<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> think<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.049> kill<00:03:03.230> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
adamant so I think I can kill the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.650 
adamant so I think I can kill the
scissor<00:03:03.799> with<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> earthquake<00:03:04.549> here<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:05.389> I

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
scissor with the earthquake here but I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.390 
scissor with the earthquake here but I
do<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.930> go<00:03:06.079> for<00:03:06.109> earthquake<00:03:06.560> I<00:03:06.709> go<00:03:06.889> for<00:03:07.099> rapid

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
do not go for earthquake I go for rapid

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.629 
do not go for earthquake I go for rapid
spin<00:03:07.609> and<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:09.019> really<00:03:09.980> really<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.489> not

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
spin and I really really do not

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.250 
spin and I really really do not
understand<00:03:11.090> why<00:03:11.239> he<00:03:11.450> switched<00:03:11.720> his<00:03:11.810> azumarill

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
understand why he switched his azumarill

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.140 
understand why he switched his azumarill
into<00:03:12.709> my<00:03:12.829> excadrill<00:03:13.130> when<00:03:13.819> I<00:03:13.849> would<00:03:14.060> have

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
into my excadrill when I would have

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.170 
into my excadrill when I would have
definitely<00:03:14.540> done<00:03:15.139> a<00:03:15.200> clean<00:03:15.970> 70%<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.090> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
definitely done a clean 70% to this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.089 
definitely done a clean 70% to this
azumarill<00:03:17.630> with<00:03:17.840> an<00:03:17.959> earthquake<00:03:18.380> if<00:03:18.620> he<00:03:18.950> knew

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
azumarill with an earthquake if he knew

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.530 
azumarill with an earthquake if he knew
I<00:03:19.130> was<00:03:19.250> gonna<00:03:19.459> rapid<00:03:19.910> spin<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.299> first

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
I was gonna rapid spin in the first

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.030 
I was gonna rapid spin in the first
place<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:21.049> yeah<00:03:21.169> as<00:03:21.319> a<00:03:21.349> good<00:03:21.590> move

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
place and yeah as a good move

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.500 
place and yeah as a good move
but<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.400> he<00:03:22.489> knew<00:03:22.609> I<00:03:22.639> was<00:03:22.819> gonna<00:03:22.940> rabbit<00:03:23.359> in<00:03:23.450> the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
but if he knew I was gonna rabbit in the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.640 
but if he knew I was gonna rabbit in the
first<00:03:23.720> place<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.079> think<00:03:24.139> he<00:03:24.380> should<00:03:24.560> have

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
first place I think he should have

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.920 
first place I think he should have
stayed<00:03:24.829> in<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.130> his<00:03:25.280> +2<00:03:25.790> sizzle<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.450> then

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
stayed in with his +2 sizzle and then

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.479 
stayed in with his +2 sizzle and then
again<00:03:27.230> that's<00:03:27.500> another<00:03:27.829> reason<00:03:28.040> he<00:03:28.250> shouldn't

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
again that's another reason he shouldn't

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.770 
again that's another reason he shouldn't
have<00:03:28.579> used<00:03:28.790> swords<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:29.269> he<00:03:29.419> just<00:03:29.569> used

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
have used swords there he just used

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.800 
have used swords there he just used
swords<00:03:30.019> dancing<00:03:30.440> kill<00:03:30.980> my<00:03:31.329> man<00:03:32.329> was<00:03:32.480> fine<00:03:32.630> in

niggers we has quick attack it didn't
use<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.180> don't<00:04:01.420> know<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.050> I<00:04:02.590> doubt<00:04:02.830> it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
use it so I don't know and I doubt it

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.470 
use it so I don't know and I doubt it
does<00:04:03.130> because<00:04:03.400> he<00:04:03.520> doesn't<00:04:03.730> use<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.000> here<00:04:04.330> and

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
does because he doesn't use it here and

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.820 
does because he doesn't use it here and
take<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.960> quick<00:04:05.230> attack<00:04:05.320> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.680> bigger

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
take a quick attack on the bigger

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.310 
take a quick attack on the bigger
definitely<00:04:06.520> would<00:04:06.640> have<00:04:06.670> done<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.910> clean<00:04:07.390> 50%

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320

circle<00:04:08.560> Peron<00:04:08.830> at<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.130> very<00:04:09.370> least<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:11.200> yeah

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
circle Peron at the very least but yeah

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.720 
circle Peron at the very least but yeah
it's<00:04:11.620> really<00:04:11.800> unfortunate<00:04:12.070> that<00:04:12.400> he<00:04:12.550> missed

it's really unfortunate that he missed
that<00:04:12.850> play<00:04:13.060> rough<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> would<00:04:13.570> have<00:04:13.660> done<00:04:13.840> like

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
that play rough it would have done like

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.289 
that play rough it would have done like
60<00:04:14.440> something<00:04:14.590> percent<00:04:15.070> probably<00:04:15.430> consider

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
60 something percent probably consider

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.729 
60 something percent probably consider
gonna<00:04:16.510> do<00:04:16.630> resisted<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.170> it<00:04:17.290> isn't<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> zoom

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
gonna do resisted but it isn't a zoom

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.530 
gonna do resisted but it isn't a zoom
around<00:04:17.890> so<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.400> go<00:04:18.730> for<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.940> bug<00:04:19.060> buzz<00:04:19.239> take<00:04:19.420> out

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
around so I go for the bug buzz take out

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.000 
around so I go for the bug buzz take out
the<00:04:19.600> diggersby<00:04:20.049> I'm<00:04:20.410> gonna<00:04:20.620> switch<00:04:20.829> out

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
the diggersby I'm gonna switch out

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.890 
the diggersby I'm gonna switch out
because<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.519> want<00:04:21.820> my<00:04:22.150> Zoomer<00:04:22.570> up<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.750> die

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
because I don't want my Zoomer up to die

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.659 
because I don't want my Zoomer up to die
and<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.710> said<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:24.010> only<00:04:24.100> needed<00:04:24.490> my

azumarill for his diggersby

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.900 
azumarill for his diggersby
so<00:04:26.410> I'm<00:04:26.470> gonna<00:04:26.620> switch<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:27.010> zoom<00:04:27.250> back<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.610> to

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820 
set up my banger I haven't used my brain
in<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.000> while<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.480> know<00:04:44.140> he<00:04:44.380> would<00:04:44.500> switch<00:04:44.680> out

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
in a while I know he would switch out

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.320 
in a while I know he would switch out
here<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.580> just<00:04:45.640> go<00:04:45.910> straight<00:04:45.940> for<00:04:46.300> the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
here so I just go straight for the

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.060 
here so I just go straight for the
u-turn<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.870> he<00:04:47.350> actually<00:04:47.620> ends<00:04:47.770> up<00:04:47.800> switching

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
u-turn and he actually ends up switching

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.070 
u-turn and he actually ends up switching
into<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.370> sizzle<00:04:48.790> or<00:04:48.880> I'm<00:04:49.060> not<00:04:49.300> sure<00:04:49.630> if<00:04:49.900> he

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
into a sizzle or I'm not sure if he

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.159 
into a sizzle or I'm not sure if he
wanted<00:04:50.440> this<00:04:50.590> thing<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.800> die<00:04:51.160> uh<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.990> either

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
wanted this thing to die uh but either

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.409 
wanted this thing to die uh but either
way<00:04:53.500> he's<00:04:53.830> lucky<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.400> didn't<00:04:54.850> go<00:04:55.000> for<00:04:55.390> the

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
way he's lucky I didn't go for the

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.469 
way he's lucky I didn't go for the
hurricane<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.169> was<00:04:56.320> thinking<00:04:56.650> about<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:57.390> but<00:04:58.390> he

opportunity to set up my mega pensive
and<00:05:34.990> what<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:35.919> usually<00:05:36.130> do<00:05:36.430> a<00:05:36.460> mega<00:05:36.729> pincer<00:05:37.150> is

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
and what I usually do a mega pincer is

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.630 
and what I usually do a mega pincer is
out<00:05:37.630> Wallis<00:05:38.470> normal<00:05:38.800> pincer<00:05:39.100> with<00:05:39.220> Moxie<00:05:39.610> I

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
out Wallis normal pincer with Moxie I

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.010 
out Wallis normal pincer with Moxie I
usually<00:05:39.940> kill<00:05:40.150> something<00:05:40.479> and<00:05:40.540> then<00:05:40.720> Megeve

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
usually kill something and then Megeve

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.350 
usually kill something and then Megeve
also<00:05:41.320> I<00:05:41.350> have<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> +1<00:05:41.919> attack<00:05:42.010> boost<00:05:42.430> while<00:05:43.300> a

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
also I have a +1 attack boost while a

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.870 
also I have a +1 attack boost while a
mega<00:05:43.690> pincer<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.070> didn't<00:05:45.550> want<00:05:45.700> to<00:05:45.760> take

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
mega pincer but I didn't want to take

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.219 
mega pincer but I didn't want to take
that<00:05:46.000> risk<00:05:46.180> first<00:05:46.479> of<00:05:46.600> all<00:05:46.720> I<00:05:46.750> knew<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:46.960> could

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
that risk first of all I knew I could

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.100 
that risk first of all I knew I could
take<00:05:47.470> a<00:05:47.650> in<00:05:48.040> aqua<00:05:48.430> jet<00:05:48.669> as<00:05:48.820> mega<00:05:49.150> pincer<00:05:49.540> and<00:05:49.750> I

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
take a in aqua jet as mega pincer and I

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.540 
take a in aqua jet as mega pincer and I
also<00:05:50.320> knew<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.680> he<00:05:50.919> might<00:05:51.130> want<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.430> switch

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
also knew that he might want to switch

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.950 
also knew that he might want to switch
out<00:05:51.640> to<00:05:51.790> his<00:05:51.910> aegislash<00:05:52.240> thinking<00:05:52.780> that<00:05:52.870> he

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
out to his aegislash thinking that he

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.830 
out to his aegislash thinking that he
could<00:05:53.080> long<00:05:53.320> me<00:05:53.560> so<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.490> predict<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.150> mega

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
could long me so I predict that mega

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.659 
could long me so I predict that mega
evolve<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.620> go<00:05:56.680> for<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:56.950> Swords<00:05:57.310> Dance

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
evolve and go for the Swords Dance

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.550 
evolve and go for the Swords Dance
and<00:05:57.790> that<00:05:58.120> ladies<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:58.510> gentlemen<00:05:58.990> I'm<00:05:59.289> afraid

and that ladies and gentlemen I'm afraid

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.710 
and that ladies and gentlemen I'm afraid
is<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.669> brat

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
is a brat

because you guys mega mega pincer is
incredibly<00:06:10.390> strong<00:06:10.690> it's<00:06:11.020> ridiculous<00:06:11.770> it

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
incredibly strong it's ridiculous it

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.190 
incredibly strong it's ridiculous it

this<00:06:14.350> thing<00:06:14.560> is<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:15.220> has<00:06:15.430> area<00:06:16.060> late<00:06:16.270> which

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
this thing is it has area late which

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.510 
this thing is it has area late which
boosts<00:06:17.050> its<00:06:17.200> normal<00:06:17.680> type<00:06:17.860> of<00:06:18.010> tax<00:06:18.190> attained

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
boosts its normal type of tax attained

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.980 
boosts its normal type of tax attained
it<00:06:18.640> changes<00:06:18.940> its<00:06:19.090> normal<00:06:19.360> type<00:06:19.480> of<00:06:19.630> tax<00:06:19.810> in<00:06:19.930> the

it changes its normal type of tax in the

it changes its normal type of tax in the
flying<00:06:20.260> moves<00:06:20.530> mega<00:06:21.160> pincer<00:06:21.490> has<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.760> flying

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
flying moves mega pincer has the flying

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.220 
flying moves mega pincer has the flying
stab<00:06:22.360> plus<00:06:23.140> area<00:06:23.590> late<00:06:23.980> increases<00:06:24.970> the<00:06:25.230> moves

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230 
stab plus area late increases the moves

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.610 
stab plus area late increases the moves
in<00:06:26.470> turn<00:06:26.680> it<00:06:27.010> affects<00:06:27.430> into<00:06:28.200> it's<00:06:29.200> essentially

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
in turn it affects into it's essentially

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.200 
in turn it affects into it's essentially
like<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:29.800> light<00:06:30.070> board<00:06:30.340> but<00:06:30.460> puts<00:06:30.670> a<00:06:30.730> life<00:06:30.940> form

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
like a light board but puts a life form

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.290 
like a light board but puts a life form
on<00:06:31.300> those<00:06:31.510> attacks<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.670> move<00:06:34.000> like<00:06:34.030> quick

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
on those attacks so I move like quick

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.300 
on those attacks so I move like quick
attack<00:06:34.540> for<00:06:34.750> instance<00:06:35.050> it<00:06:35.560> goes<00:06:35.590> from<00:06:35.950> 40<00:06:36.220> to

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
attack for instance it goes from 40 to

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.220 
attack for instance it goes from 40 to
60<00:06:36.430> because<00:06:36.850> of<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.090> stab<00:06:37.330> of<00:06:37.540> the<00:06:37.690> area<00:06:38.050> late

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
60 because of the stab of the area late

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.870 
60 because of the stab of the area late
I've<00:06:38.440> been<00:06:38.590> to<00:06:38.710> a<00:06:38.740> flying-type<00:06:39.100> move<00:06:39.400> but<00:06:39.760> then

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
I've been to a flying-type move but then

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.880 
I've been to a flying-type move but then
area<00:06:40.150> late<00:06:40.330> also<00:06:40.660> adds<00:06:40.840> a<00:06:40.990> 30%<00:06:41.530> boost<00:06:41.650> to<00:06:41.860> that

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
area late also adds a 30% boost to that

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.710 
area late also adds a 30% boost to that
so<00:06:42.190> it's<00:06:42.310> essentially<00:06:42.880> like<00:06:42.910> a<00:06:43.060> it's<00:06:43.540> like<00:06:43.570> an

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
so it's essentially like a it's like an

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.100 
so it's essentially like a it's like an
extreme<00:06:44.050> speed<00:06:44.350> like<00:06:44.620> Base<00:06:44.800> 89<00:06:45.250> so<00:06:46.150> because<00:06:46.990> of

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
extreme speed like Base 89 so because of

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.930 
extreme speed like Base 89 so because of
all<00:06:47.260> that<00:06:47.320> I'm<00:06:47.920> just<00:06:47.950> rambling<00:06:48.460> at<00:06:48.550> this<00:06:48.700> point

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
all that I'm just rambling at this point

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.860 
all that I'm just rambling at this point
because<00:06:49.450> of<00:06:49.480> all<00:06:49.720> that<00:06:49.750> a<00:06:50.080> +2<00:06:50.800> quick<00:06:51.040> attack<00:06:51.370> is

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
because of all that a +2 quick attack is

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.120 
because of all that a +2 quick attack is
definitely<00:06:52.870> enough<00:06:53.169> to<00:06:53.200> take<00:06:53.530> out<00:06:53.680> an<00:06:53.830> over

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
definitely enough to take out an over

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.450 
definitely enough to take out an over
from<00:06:54.340> 75%<00:06:55.270> it's<00:06:55.930> ridiculous<00:06:56.800> how<00:06:56.950> strong<00:06:57.310> this

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
from 75% it's ridiculous how strong this

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.760 
from 75% it's ridiculous how strong this
thing<00:06:57.640> is<00:06:57.790> it's<00:06:57.910> way<00:06:58.090> too<00:06:58.150> powerful<00:06:58.780> obviously

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
thing is it's way too powerful obviously

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.820 
thing is it's way too powerful obviously
if<00:07:00.700> annoy<00:07:01.090> weren't<00:07:01.360> gonna<00:07:01.510> die<00:07:01.660> from<00:07:01.810> 75%<00:07:02.620> a

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
if annoy weren't gonna die from 75% a

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.980 
if annoy weren't gonna die from 75% a
mega<00:07:03.250> scissors<00:07:03.580> gonna<00:07:03.760> die<00:07:03.940> for<00:07:04.150> 30%<00:07:04.540> let's

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
mega scissors gonna die for 30% let's

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.040 
mega scissors gonna die for 30% let's
just<00:07:05.260> be<00:07:05.380> realistic<00:07:05.740> here<00:07:05.980> guys<00:07:06.870> so<00:07:07.870> I<00:07:07.930> was

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
just be realistic here guys so I was

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.659 
just be realistic here guys so I was
able<00:07:08.140> to<00:07:08.260> take<00:07:08.440> out<00:07:08.590> his<00:07:08.710> aegis<00:07:09.040> lies<00:07:09.250> with<00:07:09.520> the

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
able to take out his aegis lies with the

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.640 
able to take out his aegis lies with the
earthquake<00:07:09.850> I<00:07:10.390> only<00:07:10.900> carrier<00:07:11.200> it's<00:07:11.320> great<00:07:11.470> for

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
earthquake I only carrier it's great for

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.930 
earthquake I only carrier it's great for
you<00:07:11.800> to<00:07:11.890> try<00:07:12.070> stuff<00:07:12.310> like<00:07:12.520> that

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
you to try stuff like that

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.310 
you to try stuff like that
otherwise<00:07:13.390> I'd<00:07:13.600> use<00:07:13.750> like<00:07:13.900> close<00:07:14.080> combat

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
otherwise I'd use like close combat
