this sort of 55:56 easy stuff she's here
it's<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> first<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.939> you'll<00:00:30.060> notice<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's the first thing you'll notice is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's the first thing you'll notice is
that<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.199> very<00:00:31.529> compact<00:00:32.030> they<00:00:33.030> really

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
that they are very compact they really

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.970 
that they are very compact they really
are<00:00:33.390> coming<00:00:33.660> nice<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.110> small<00:00:34.410> ways<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> like

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are coming nice and small ways I like

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.030 
are coming nice and small ways I like
these<00:00:35.219> they're<00:00:35.460> very<00:00:35.640> light<00:00:36.020> very<00:00:37.020> very<00:00:37.620> small

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
these they're very light very very small

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
these they're very light very very small
so<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> 26c<00:00:39.899> see<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.469> instance<00:00:40.649> they

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so you 26c see one for instance they

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.600 
so you 26c see one for instance they
really<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.250> quite<00:00:41.430> tiny<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.450> nicely<00:00:42.660> made

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
really are quite tiny but nicely made

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
really are quite tiny but nicely made
now<00:00:44.610> pit<00:00:45.120> silence<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:45.750> picks<00:00:45.960> answers

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
now pit silence is what picks answers

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.690 
now pit silence is what picks answers
all<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.710> silences<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.250> certain

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
all about bit silences have certain

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
all about bit silences have certain
advantages<00:00:47.840> more<00:00:48.840> often<00:00:49.260> than<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
advantages more often than not when you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
advantages more often than not when you
buy<00:00:50.370> new<00:00:50.399> gas<00:00:50.820> engine<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> truth<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
buy new gas engine the truth is that the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
buy new gas engine the truth is that the
standard<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.430> too<00:00:53.640> loud<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.210> call

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
standard can is just too loud I call

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
standard can is just too loud I call
that<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:55.920> call<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> muffler

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that a can and don't call it a muffler

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490 
that a can and don't call it a muffler
because<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.780> stretching<00:00:58.109> things

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
because that would be stretching things

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.439 
because that would be stretching things
a<00:00:58.590> little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.890> generally<00:00:59.340> speaking<00:00:59.609> as<00:01:00.210> they

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
a little bit generally speaking as they

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.889 
a little bit generally speaking as they
are<00:01:00.750> literally<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:02.070> open<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.420> pitch

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
are literally just an open can so pitch

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
are literally just an open can so pitch
silence<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.470> why<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.650> people<00:01:04.739> fit<00:01:05.159> pit<00:01:05.519> stops

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
silence is why do people fit pit stops

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
silence is why do people fit pit stops
well<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> first<00:01:06.180> ones<00:01:06.420> obvious<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.890> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
well the first ones obvious that is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
well the first ones obvious that is
space<00:01:08.400> particularly<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.240> narrow<00:01:11.030> cowl<00:01:12.030> models

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
space particularly on narrow cowl models

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
space particularly on narrow cowl models
so<00:01:13.320> obviously<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.920> gives<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> lot<00:01:14.400> more

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so obviously this gives you a lot more

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
so obviously this gives you a lot more
room<00:01:14.610> yeah<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> sounds<00:01:15.509> too<00:01:15.600> stuck

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
room yeah I'm going to sounds too stuck

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.830 
room yeah I'm going to sounds too stuck
to<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.080> side<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:17.909> nice<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.630> well

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to one side and it's nice nice as well

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.020 
to one side and it's nice nice as well
two<00:01:19.110> little<00:01:19.350> exit<00:01:19.680> holes<00:01:20.030> particularly

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
two little exit holes particularly

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
two little exit holes particularly
usually<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> rear<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> cowl<00:01:22.259> what's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
usually at the rear of the cowl what's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.570 
usually at the rear of the cowl what's
really<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.189> nice

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really really nice

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.929 
really really nice
however<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.750> also<00:01:25.080> battled<00:01:25.939> which

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
however they are also battled which

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
however they are also battled which
means<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.380> noise<00:01:28.590> restrictions<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
means if you have noise restrictions and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
means if you have noise restrictions and
if<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.850> being<00:01:30.560> shall<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.650> say

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
if you are being shall we say

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.969 
if you are being shall we say
responsible<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.689> basically<00:01:34.350> these<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
responsible then basically these are a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.010 
responsible then basically these are a
really<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.759> idea<00:01:35.900> particularly<00:01:36.900> as

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
really really good idea particularly as

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
really really good idea particularly as
small<00:01:37.380> models<00:01:37.799> generally<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
small models generally do not have a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
small models generally do not have a
cavity<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> tune<00:01:41.009> service<00:01:41.460> or<00:01:41.700> because

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cavity for a tune service or because

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
cavity for a tune service or because
obviously<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.570> until<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.020> we've<00:01:43.229> only<00:01:43.320> really

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
obviously up until now we've only really

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.749 
obviously up until now we've only really
offered<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:44.159> pipes<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:46.110> basically

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
offered two pipes so they basically

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.130 
offered two pipes so they basically
there<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.970> sorts<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.479> reasons<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:49.110> use

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there are all sorts of reasons to use

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
there are all sorts of reasons to use
these<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.770> they're<00:01:49.920> extremely<00:01:50.250> popular<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
