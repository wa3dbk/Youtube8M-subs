00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.110
 point sending the remaining direct and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.840
 flexy this wonder you can eat 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.060
 what I understand right and wrong exists 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.340
 young people have no diet in this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.350
 universe where you're going to have coke 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.290
 started all day and stay dry 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.160
 forget it and it does not matter that 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.840
 drugs you even use ght 3 with inter 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.970
 or has limits 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.260
 Do you need to weight even objects? 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.600
 not restricted 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.840
 let's go for the flexible diet concept 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.570
 also known by the acronym and fyn 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.480
 idea of ​​this diet that the body does not know 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.310
 that the food is clean or dirty he knows the 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.980
 which are macro nutrients that are 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.530
 carbohydrates fats and proteins 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.630
 independent of source forty grams of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.330
 carbohydrate from chocolate or from 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.510
 sweet potatoes would have the same effect 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.390
 I think nonsense is not 40 grams of 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.950
 carbohydrate from whatever source the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 Same amount of calories 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 the difference in speed it will be 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.350
 acquired 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.500
 The simpler the carbohydrate 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 fast and therein lies the problem when 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.129
 digested and absorbed very fast you 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.200
 will be left with is also faster 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.390
 understood that the disadvantage 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.400
 Or are you saying that I can? 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.120
 exchange sweet chocolate potato since 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.950
 resist the hunger of negative chocolate 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.819
 has only carbohydrate full of 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.799
 also finds sweet potatoes not 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.650
 are there watching the play the 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.140
 food that our body uses 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.079
 to play with a fairer taste 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.700
 the rites forwarding simple fat 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.400
 that is why this battle they have to 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.260
 face to avoid them beauty then 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 Let's learn how to build a diet. 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.069
 flexible way 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.439
 the first thing to do is define 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.829
 how many calories you will ingest 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.290
 based on your goal is to grow or 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.629
 dry but this varies absurdly from 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.519
 person to person and I can not help 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.400
 very much the staff in formulas and ways to 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.019
 establish this number on the internet 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.519
 where it was none will give you a 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.440
 very accurate result 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.900
 my suggestion is to use a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.010
 these forms with esther and trying to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.159
 and error 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.540
 the best telefilm and needs with 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.599
 the amount of calories you 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.750
 want to manage on hand you will know if 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.329
 how much of these areas will be carbohydrates and 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.049
 fat and protein will set a 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:28.260
 proportion for example 30% have 15% 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.269
 fat 55 in carbohydrates 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.310
 remembering that only one example of this 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.690
 proportion depends on your purpose and 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.790
 personal response 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.040
 I indicated to see my video that is called 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.810
 Ride your diet because I always stay 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.780
 three types proportions of macronutrients 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.169
 for different purposes 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.659
 an example to show here in the video I 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.099
 I suppose it's going to be a book fuck and with 5 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.530
 one thousand calories 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.519
 knowing that each gram of protein is 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.859
 carbohydrate in about 4 calories each 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.229
 gram of fat has a name and 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:04.079
 I told you about this and that 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:07.949
 diet would have approximately 335 grams 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:10.019
 687 gram of protein and carbohydrate 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.199
 83 grams of fat 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:17.039
 always remembering 100 grams of rice 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:19.440
 or potato or whatever is not equal to 100 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.510
 grams of carbohydrate for this you 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.820
 need a nutritional chart and check 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.289
 use a table the application that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.199
 The way he told you 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.750
 so far it seems very simple is not the 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.900
 problem is that many stop here and 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.340
 you can simply face everything, wake up know 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.979
 that can start the channeling of 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 carbohydrate whole day there and go straight 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.480
 Shit, a guy wakes up and eats pizza with 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.840
 coca cola popcorn 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.760
 but then he thinks it's cool that day 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.830
 also restricts the type of food 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.380
 This is where the problem arises when two 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.050
 in the afternoon he realizes that he has already reached 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.210
 the daily limit of fat is about 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.000
 to hit a carbohydrate and barely touched 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.070
 proteins to maintain 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.410
 within limits the guy will have to 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.530
 spend the rest of the day taking 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.530
 some human mine and with clear fear of 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.960
 egg with grilled chicken breast and is 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.790
 This is what I mean by this is the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.060
 flexible do not restrict 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.070
 nothing but she charges the price for every 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.320
 food we call trash you 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.460
 put you'll have to pay for it 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.170
 further on 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.050
 basically you will remove from a 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.730
 meal to put in another 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.060
 for example you are going to take a plate of 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.490
 rice with red meat you eat and 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.640
 put in the egg-clear place with chicken 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.910
 to be able to free space between quotation marks 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.950
 to eat chocolate then they understood 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.860
 For the people who want to enter this 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.440
 Flexible advance requires discipline as 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.470
 any other you can any 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.600
 only in quotation marks and this 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.360
 thought that can anything that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.290
 Fuck all, for those who know how to do it. 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.350
 I believe it's an alternative 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.750
 excellent mainly for mere 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.810
 Deadly on competition 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.670
 Can you maintain a proper diet? 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.690
 and can fit a nonsense when 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.970
 well understand 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.090
 just can not lose the mother to see trash 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.980
 right for those who want to have an application that 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.780
 Call us, let's get this dust. 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.030
 it is very useful for anyone who wants to do 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.140
 anyone who wants to lower their will is 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.050
 free 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.450
 for today this is what you liked is on the channel 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.900
 is written there does not forget the evaluation of the 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:35.190
 favored a hug and even more 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:38.160
 and today forgetting me the snow scarpelli 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.660
 started in his last video members 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.460
 I did not expect this in a 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.260
 some 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.320
 a lot of people came to me to talk about 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.630
 This and first of all I thank you immensely. 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.200
 to all the compliments 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:55.530
 I found a fuck and then someone who knows 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.370
 event of this life does not take away the 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.110
 mask 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.610
 shake his hand like he said it 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.830
 I think the guy deserves it. 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.830
 thanks a hug and get the skin
