00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.779 
in my mind Treyarch is is being told by
activision<00:06:31.380> in<00:06:31.500> it<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:31.800> it's<00:06:31.919> it<00:06:32.550> would<00:06:32.669> be

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
the series as a whole so really I just

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.800 
the series as a whole so really I just
think<00:07:11.930> this<00:07:12.259> is<00:07:12.320> this<00:07:13.060> this<00:07:14.060> is<00:07:14.120> really<00:07:14.419> just<00:07:14.539> a

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
think this is this this is really just a

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.600 
think this is this this is really just a
