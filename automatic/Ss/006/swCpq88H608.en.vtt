okay well there you got it about 20
seconds<00:02:32.200> versus<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> minute<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.819> don't<00:02:34.030> know

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
seconds versus a minute and I don't know

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.870 
seconds versus a minute and I don't know
if<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:34.360> an<00:02:34.900> indication<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.980> software<00:02:36.790> or

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
if it's an indication of the software or

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.990 
if it's an indication of the software or
hardware<00:02:37.270> but<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.800> like<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.430> said<00:02:39.610> before<00:02:39.730> you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
hardware but it's like I said before you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.960

indication of the hardware and the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.620 
indication of the hardware and the
software<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.489> was<00:03:09.580> used<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.910> bring<00:03:10.540> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
after I've used it a little bit and see

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.380 
after I've used it a little bit and see
how<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.720> battery<00:03:20.019> holds<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.799> you<00:03:21.670> know<00:03:21.819> it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the ease of use how quickly it will

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.490 
the ease of use how quickly it will
resync<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:25.360> will<00:03:25.630> be<00:03:25.750> using<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.170> back<00:03:26.319> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
resync and I will be using it back and
