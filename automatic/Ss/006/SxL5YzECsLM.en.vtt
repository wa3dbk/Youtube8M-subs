he<00:00:39.629> did<00:00:39.839> really<00:00:40.019> well<00:00:40.139> at<00:00:40.979> one<00:00:41.159> point<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:42.299 
he did really well at one point we

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.569 
he did really well at one point we
almost<00:00:42.479> got<00:00:42.809> her<00:00:42.929> buried<00:00:43.319> but<00:00:43.799> for<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.429> most

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
is turned kind of hard the corn stubble

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
is turned kind of hard the corn stubble
knocks<00:00:58.109> down<00:00:58.350> real<00:00:58.739> easy<00:00:58.979> and<00:00:59.159> will<00:00:59.399> make<00:00:59.549> it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
knocks down real easy and will make it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.469 
knocks down real easy and will make it
pretty<00:01:00.690> suitable<00:01:01.260> for<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.499> replant<00:01:02.069> with<00:01:02.369> a

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
pretty suitable for a replant with a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.410 
pretty suitable for a replant with a
no-till<00:01:03.479> kind<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.929> situation<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> turn

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
no-till kind of situation but as we turn

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
no-till kind of situation but as we turn
this<00:01:06.630> bottom<00:01:07.049> corner<00:01:07.079> and<00:01:07.710> start<00:01:08.070> heading<00:01:08.369> up

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this bottom corner and start heading up

this bottom corner and start heading up
into<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.789> middle<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.210> field<00:01:10.130> groundwater

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
into the middle of the field groundwater

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.249 
into the middle of the field groundwater
is<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.700> gentle<00:01:12.180> too<00:01:12.390> close<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> top<00:01:13.200> of

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
is just gentle too close to the top of

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.889 
is just gentle too close to the top of
the<00:01:13.500> clay<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.729> turns<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.240> muck<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> even

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899

this<00:01:43.289> is<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> part<00:01:43.799> where<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.399> coming

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this is the part where I was coming

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.779 
this is the part where I was coming
across<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.210> middle<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:47.009> turned<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> make

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
across the middle and I turned to make

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.529 
across the middle and I turned to make
kind<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.979> north-northeast<00:01:49.979> run<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
kind of a north-northeast run and as I

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.809 
kind of a north-northeast run and as I
do<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.170> tractor<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:53.189> starts<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> bog

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
do that the tractor really starts to bog

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.399 
do that the tractor really starts to bog
down<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> play<00:01:54.509> I'll<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> pick<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
down in a play I'll have to pick the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.099
