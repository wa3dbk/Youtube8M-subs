Roger<00:04:24.880> beep<00:04:25.180> boards<00:04:25.740> will<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.830> going<00:04:27.010> into

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
Roger beep boards will be going into

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.310 
Roger beep boards will be going into
that<00:04:27.400> at<00:04:27.670> another<00:04:27.940> stage<00:04:28.410> because<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.710> have

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
that at another stage because we do have

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.120 
that at another stage because we do have
somewhere<00:04:32.320> here<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:34.750> facilities<00:04:35.380> for<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.980> I

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
somewhere here the facilities for it I

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.600 
somewhere here the facilities for it I
believe<00:04:36.460> let<00:04:36.820> me<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.240> look<00:04:38.340> yeah<00:04:39.340> here<00:04:39.580> we

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
believe let me have a look yeah here we

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.860 
believe let me have a look yeah here we
go<00:04:39.990> we<00:04:40.990> have<00:04:41.020> a<00:04:41.200> echo<00:04:41.920> board<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.870> another

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
go we have a echo board and another

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.750 
go we have a echo board and another
thing<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.680> programming<00:04:45.280> board<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.730> looks

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
thing is a programming board it looks

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.050 
thing is a programming board it looks
like<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.300> me<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.630> don't<00:04:46.810> know<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.380> a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
like to me I don't know we have a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.050 
like to me I don't know we have a
programming<00:04:49.060> board<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.540> an<00:04:49.600> echo<00:04:49.870> board<00:04:50.140> time

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
programming board and an echo board time

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.210 
programming board and an echo board time
volume<00:04:52.060> so<00:04:52.300> that's<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.600> code<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:54.100> other

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
volume so that's a code and the other

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.590 
volume so that's a code and the other
one<00:04:54.430> looks<00:04:54.640> like<00:04:54.850> a<00:04:55.000> programming<00:04:55.930> board<00:04:56.590> so

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
one looks like a programming board so

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.790 
one looks like a programming board so
don't<00:04:58.600> know<00:04:58.780> we'll<00:04:59.080> have<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.320> look<00:04:59.410> into<00:04:59.620> that

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
don't know we'll have a look into that

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.450 
don't know we'll have a look into that
later<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.790> in<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.540> meantime<00:05:01.720> guys<00:05:02.370> looks<00:05:03.370> a

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
later so in the meantime guys looks a

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.490 
later so in the meantime guys looks a
bit<00:05:03.490> like<00:05:03.610> an<00:05:03.910> Allen<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.510> trust<00:05:04.810> me<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.260> works

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
bit like an Allen but trust me it works

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.950 
bit like an Allen but trust me it works
a<00:05:05.860> lot<00:05:06.340> better<00:05:06.400> than<00:05:06.820> Allen<00:05:07.210> less<00:05:07.630> birdie

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
a lot better than Allen less birdie

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.050 
a lot better than Allen less birdie
noises<00:05:08.620> better<00:05:08.980> build<00:05:09.280> quality<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:12.060> inside

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
noises better build quality and inside

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.510 
noises better build quality and inside
it's<00:05:15.390> manufactured<00:05:16.390> in<00:05:17.260> China<00:05:17.860> probably<00:05:18.430> the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
it's manufactured in China probably the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.070 
it's manufactured in China probably the
same<00:05:19.140> country<00:05:20.140> as<00:05:20.260> Island<00:05:20.590> of<00:05:20.830> course<00:05:21.130> but

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
same country as Island of course but

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.230 
same country as Island of course but
this<00:05:23.080> one<00:05:23.320> it's<00:05:24.010> got<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> good<00:05:24.550> manufacturer

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
this one it's got a good manufacturer

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.970 
this one it's got a good manufacturer
behind<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.230> well<00:05:27.070> made<00:05:28.500> prices<00:05:29.500> again

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
behind it it's well made prices again

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.740 
behind it it's well made prices again
will<00:05:30.250> be<00:05:30.340> on<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.520> website<00:05:30.700> because<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.690> think
