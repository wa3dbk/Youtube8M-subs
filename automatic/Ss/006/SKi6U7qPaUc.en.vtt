everything<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> only<00:00:32.910> things<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> don't<00:00:33.480> put

everything the only things I don't put
in<00:00:33.960> modules<00:00:34.440> are<00:00:34.710> carrots<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.820> they

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
in modules are carrots because they

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.830 
in modules are carrots because they
don't<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.630> well

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
don't do very well

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
don't do very well
the<00:00:37.140> minute<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> end<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> carrot<00:00:38.610> root

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the minute the end of the carrot root

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.959 
the minute the end of the carrot root
hits<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.719> bottom<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> tray<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.920> Forks<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
hits the bottom of the tray it Forks so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.160 
hits the bottom of the tray it Forks so
that<00:00:42.090> when<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> plant<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.020> this

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that when you plant it out you get this

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.310 
that when you plant it out you get this
really<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> knotted<00:00:44.579> carrot<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> radish

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
really kind of knotted carrot and radish

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.869 
really kind of knotted carrot and radish
because<00:00:46.890> they're<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.190> quick<00:00:47.489> there's<00:00:47.760> no

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
because they're so quick there's no

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
because they're so quick there's no
point<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.020> germinate

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
point you know they just germinate

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.799 
point you know they just germinate
pretty<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.039> anywhere<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.670> any<00:00:50.969> time<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
pretty much anywhere at any time so you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:52.910 
pretty much anywhere at any time so you
might<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.110> well<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.350> sort<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> chuck<00:00:52.770> them

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
might as well just sort of chuck them

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
might as well just sort of chuck them
straight<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> ground<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:55.770> make<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
straight into the ground to make the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.569 
straight into the ground to make the
most<00:00:56.370> space<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:58.170> trays<00:00:58.710> initially

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
most space or so into trays initially

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.869 
most space or so into trays initially
and<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.780> trays<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.100> into<00:01:02.430> modules

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and then from trays I so into modules

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
and then from trays I so into modules
that<00:01:03.480> way<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.989> really<00:01:04.379> concentrate<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that way you can really concentrate a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.609 
that way you can really concentrate a
lot<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> particularly<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:07.049> crop<00:01:07.320> needs

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
lot in particularly if your crop needs

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.429 
lot in particularly if your crop needs
heat<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> beginning<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
heat at the beginning to get going and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
heat at the beginning to get going and
get<00:01:10.560> germinating<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> shove<00:01:12.030> tiny

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
get germinating you can shove tiny

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
get germinating you can shove tiny
amount<00:01:12.720> into<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.140> small<00:01:13.200> space<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
amount into a really small space and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.230 
amount into a really small space and
then<00:01:14.010> once<00:01:14.220> they're<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.820> tend<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.119> need

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
then once they're up they tend to need

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390 
then once they're up they tend to need
less<00:01:15.479> heat<00:01:15.810> then<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> stop<00:01:16.619> pricking

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
less heat then you can stop pricking

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.710 
less heat then you can stop pricking
them<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.729> modules<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.299> moving<00:01:18.600> in

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
them out into modules and moving in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.800 
them out into modules and moving in
outside<00:01:19.530> into<00:01:20.310> coal<00:01:20.520> frames<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:23.659> just<00:01:24.659> want

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
outside into coal frames and I just want

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.140 
outside into coal frames and I just want
a<00:01:24.869> tiny<00:01:25.140> amount<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.560> seed<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a tiny amount of seed you don't want to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.819 
a tiny amount of seed you don't want to
sow<00:01:27.299> too<00:01:27.360> thickly<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.439> whole<00:01:28.560> point

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
sow too thickly because the whole point

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
sow too thickly because the whole point
was<00:01:28.920> successional<00:01:29.610> sowing<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.259> it's<00:01:31.259> little

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
was successional sowing is it's little

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
was successional sowing is it's little
and<00:01:31.710> often<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> minute<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.979> lot<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.670> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
and often the minute one lot is up like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.940 
and often the minute one lot is up like
this<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> I've<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.689> good<00:01:36.900> growth<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.770> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this and I've got good growth that's a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
this and I've got good growth that's a
sign<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> sow<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> next<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
sign that I need to sow the next lot and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
sign that I need to sow the next lot and
I<00:01:39.930> keep<00:01:40.170> doing<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.250> give<00:01:41.280> me

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
I keep doing that and that will give me

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.889 
I keep doing that and that will give me
continuous<00:01:42.180> cropping<00:01:42.420> right<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> way

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
continuous cropping right the way

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.550 
continuous cropping right the way
through<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> summer<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> next<00:01:45.630> stage<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
through the summer so the next stage is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
through the summer so the next stage is
to<00:01:46.619> prick<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.790> once<00:01:48.000> they've

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
to prick them out once they've

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
to prick them out once they've
germinated<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.869> can't<00:01:49.110> leave<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
germinated you can't leave them in this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
germinated you can't leave them in this
tray<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.210> least<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.750> leave<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.049> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
tray or at least you could leave them in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
tray or at least you could leave them in
this<00:01:52.229> trade<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.740> what<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.850> happen<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
this trade but what would happen is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.700 
this trade but what would happen is
after<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.750> while<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> all<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
after a while because of all the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.370 
after a while because of all the
competition<00:01:56.369> probably<00:01:57.210> only<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.869> quarter<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
competition probably only a quarter of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.810 
competition probably only a quarter of
them<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.070> mature<00:01:59.399> into<00:01:59.670> nice

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
them would really mature into nice

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
them would really mature into nice
plants<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.540> rest<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.290> really

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
plants and the rest would just be really

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.139 
plants and the rest would just be really
squeezed<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.640> there's<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:02.909> enough

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
squeezed out because there's not enough

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
squeezed out because there's not enough
food<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> there's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:03.930> enough<00:02:04.200> space<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.670> by

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
food and there's not enough space so by

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.089 
food and there's not enough space so by
pricking<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:07.259> allow<00:02:07.469> them<00:02:07.680> each<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
pricking them out you allow them each to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.360 
pricking them out you allow them each to
have<00:02:08.330> their<00:02:09.330> own<00:02:09.560> perfect<00:02:10.560> amount<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.129> space

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
have their own perfect amount of space

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.240 
have their own perfect amount of space
to<00:02:11.610> grow<00:02:11.910> really<00:02:12.150> healthy<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.660> that's

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to grow really healthy and that's

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.560 
to grow really healthy and that's
important<00:02:13.700> because<00:02:13.790> when<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.060> go<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.210> put<00:02:14.480> it

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
important because when you go to put it

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.290 
important because when you go to put it
out<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.930> garden<00:02:15.290> if<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.100> got<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.670> really

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
out in the garden if it's got a really

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.750 
out in the garden if it's got a really
strong<00:02:17.510> healthy<00:02:18.440> root<00:02:18.860> system<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
strong healthy root system and it's a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.390 
strong healthy root system and it's a
nice<00:02:20.060> healthy<00:02:20.750> little<00:02:21.230> plant<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.710> can<00:02:21.860> take<00:02:22.130> on

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
nice healthy little plant it can take on

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.580 
nice healthy little plant it can take on
the<00:02:22.850> big<00:02:22.880> bad<00:02:23.240> wide<00:02:23.540> world<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.260> take<00:02:24.440> on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the big bad wide world it can take on

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.170 
the big bad wide world it can take on
the<00:02:24.770> slugs<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.340> take<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.490> all<00:02:25.640> sorts

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
the slugs it can take on all sorts

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.450 
the slugs it can take on all sorts
because<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.600> got<00:02:26.870> these<00:02:27.590> roots<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.370> are

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
because it's got these roots that are

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.680 
because it's got these roots that are
going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> go<00:02:28.730> straight<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.240> way<00:02:29.330> out<00:02:29.510> into

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
going to go straight the way out into

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.310 
going to go straight the way out into
the<00:02:29.870> ground<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.410> on<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:30.560> life

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
the ground and get on with life

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.170 
the ground and get on with life
so<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.620> either<00:02:33.740> use<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> chopstick<00:02:34.370> or<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
so you either use like a chopstick or a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.400 
so you either use like a chopstick or a
pencil<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.930> just<00:02:36.170> go<00:02:37.100> underneath<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
pencil and you just go underneath the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.490 
pencil and you just go underneath the
root<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> plant<00:02:40.780> handle<00:02:41.780> your<00:02:42.020> seedling

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
root of the plant handle your seedling

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.210 
root of the plant handle your seedling
by<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.950> leaves<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.880> never<00:02:44.300> the<00:02:44.510> stem<00:02:45.220> that's

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
by the leaves and never the stem that's

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.300 
by the leaves and never the stem that's
because<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> stem<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.090> really<00:02:47.750> delicate<00:02:48.310> all

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
because the stem is really delicate all

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.610 
because the stem is really delicate all
seedlings<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.090> two<00:02:50.720> sets<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.080> leaves<00:02:51.350> they

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
seedlings have two sets of leaves they

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.199 
seedlings have two sets of leaves they
have<00:02:51.800> baby<00:02:52.220> leaves<00:02:52.550> which<00:02:52.850> are<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.060> first

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
have baby leaves which are the first

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.760 
have baby leaves which are the first
leaves<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.810> appear<00:02:54.170> when<00:02:54.380> they<00:02:54.530> germinate

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
leaves that appear when they germinate

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.510 
leaves that appear when they germinate
and<00:02:55.340> then<00:02:55.970> their<00:02:56.150> true<00:02:56.480> leaves<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:58.310> true

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
and then their true leaves and the true

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.550 
and then their true leaves and the true
leaders<00:02:58.850> are<00:02:58.940> their<00:02:59.300> adult<00:02:59.660> leaves<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.110> it's

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
leaders are their adult leaves and it's

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.070 
leaders are their adult leaves and it's
really<00:03:00.800> important<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.520> handle<00:03:02.180> why<00:03:03.020> the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
really important that you handle why the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.410 
really important that you handle why the
baby<00:03:03.410> leaves<00:03:03.739> because<00:03:04.370> these<00:03:04.550> essentially

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
baby leaves because these essentially

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.229 
baby leaves because these essentially
are<00:03:05.630> large<00:03:06.560> fast-growing<00:03:07.340> leaves<00:03:07.700> that<00:03:08.030> are

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
are large fast-growing leaves that are

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.840 
are large fast-growing leaves that are
there<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.780> get<00:03:08.900> life<00:03:09.170> going<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.850> they're

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
there just to get life going and they're

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.880 
there just to get life going and they're
going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.209> get<00:03:11.360> rid<00:03:11.570> of<00:03:11.660> them<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.620> couple<00:03:12.739> of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
going to get rid of them in a couple of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.380 
going to get rid of them in a couple of
weeks<00:03:13.010> time<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.520> if<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.640> damaged<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.239> it's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
weeks time so if you damaged them it's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.090 
weeks time so if you damaged them it's
not<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:14.690> bad<00:03:14.870> whereas<00:03:15.320> if<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.530> damaged<00:03:15.860> one<00:03:16.010> of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
not so bad whereas if you damaged one of

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.320 
not so bad whereas if you damaged one of
their<00:03:16.220> true<00:03:16.459> leaves<00:03:17.290> then<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.940> little<00:03:20.060> bit

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
their true leaves then it's a little bit

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.020 
their true leaves then it's a little bit
more<00:03:20.510> detrimental

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
more detrimental

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.990 
more detrimental
and<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.870> start<00:03:24.590> off<00:03:24.740> for<00:03:25.010> my<00:03:25.190> peas<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.819> broad

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
and I start off for my peas and broad

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.850 
and I start off for my peas and broad
beans<00:03:26.240> this<00:03:26.480> way<00:03:26.660> although<00:03:26.930> it's<00:03:27.200> perfectly

beans this way although it's perfectly

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.620 
beans this way although it's perfectly
acceptable<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.459> go<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.910> do<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.090> straight<00:03:29.390> into

acceptable to go and do it straight into

acceptable to go and do it straight into

the ground I do find you get really

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.309 
the ground I do find you get really
erratic<00:03:31.130> germination<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.480> looks<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:32.810> nice<00:03:33.020> and

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
erratic germination it looks so nice and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.620 
erratic germination it looks so nice and
satisfying<00:03:33.860> don't<00:03:34.220> they
