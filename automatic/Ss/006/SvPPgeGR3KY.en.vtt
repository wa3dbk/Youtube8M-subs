of<00:01:42.000> getting<00:01:42.299> beat<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.579> that<00:01:44.579> wasn't<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of getting beat up so that wasn't the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.190 
of getting beat up so that wasn't the
reason<00:01:45.060> why<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> didn't<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.869> fight<00:01:46.020> him

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
reason why I didn't want to fight him

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
reason why I didn't want to fight him
it's<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.430> fighting<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.929 
it's just that I don't like fighting and
I<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.720> think<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.939> people

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
I don't think it's right because people
