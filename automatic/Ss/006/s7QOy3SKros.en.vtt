smaller<00:00:20.690> size<00:00:21.050> because<00:00:21.620> to<00:00:21.860> believe<00:00:22.220> your

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
smaller size because to believe your

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.180 
smaller size because to believe your
eyes<00:00:22.760> are<00:00:23.060> always<00:00:23.360> always<00:00:23.810> bigger<00:00:24.170> than

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
eyes are always always bigger than

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.490 
eyes are always always bigger than
or<00:00:25.520> if<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.240> want<00:00:26.450> to<00:00:26.510> grab<00:00:26.690> a<00:00:26.720> larger<00:00:27.050> one

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
or if you want to grab a larger one

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.290 
or if you want to grab a larger one
that's<00:00:27.890> why<00:00:28.070> would<00:00:28.370> be<00:00:28.640> sure<00:00:28.850> to<00:00:28.970> break<00:00:29.120> it

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
that's why would be sure to break it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.690 
that's why would be sure to break it
into<00:00:29.450> two<00:00:29.600> wheels<00:00:30.020> so<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.130> first<00:00:31.310> thing<00:00:31.460> we're

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
into two wheels so the first thing we're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.650 
into two wheels so the first thing we're
going<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:31.880> start<00:00:32.119> with<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.570> deep<00:00:33.200> dark

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
going to start with is deep dark

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.150 
going to start with is deep dark
so<00:00:34.930> we're<00:00:35.170> going<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.350> go<00:00:35.440> over<00:00:35.470> here

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.130 

we<00:00:39.670> have<00:00:39.760> baby<00:00:40.120> spinach<00:00:40.540> and<00:00:41.230> we<00:00:41.350> have<00:00:41.500> mixed

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
we have baby spinach and we have mixed

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.680 
we have baby spinach and we have mixed
if

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
if

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.930 
if
always<00:00:44.469> always<00:00:44.739> go<00:00:45.070> for<00:00:45.280> baby<00:00:45.489> spinach

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
always always go for baby spinach

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.910 
always always go for baby spinach
because<00:00:46.359> it<00:00:46.840> has<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.260> least<00:00:47.440> amount<00:00:47.680> of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
because it has the least amount of

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.590 
because it has the least amount of
calories<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.760> highest<00:00:49.149> level<00:00:49.510> of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
calories of the highest level of

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.470 
calories of the highest level of
antioxidants<00:00:50.589> minerals<00:00:50.800> vitamins<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.760> this

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
antioxidants minerals vitamins so this

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.100 
antioxidants minerals vitamins so this
is<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.809> first<00:00:53.079> thing<00:00:53.320> that's<00:00:53.440> going<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.800> go<00:00:55.110> so

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
is the first thing that's going to go so

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.850 
is the first thing that's going to go so
depending<00:00:56.739> on<00:00:56.739> how<00:00:57.039> much<00:00:57.159> you<00:00:57.370> want<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:59.649> going

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
depending on how much you want I'm going

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.310 
depending on how much you want I'm going
to<00:00:59.920> pull<00:01:00.129> it<00:01:00.159> like<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:01.570> from<00:01:01.809> there<00:01:01.989> we<00:01:02.019> go

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
to pull it like that so from there we go

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.499 
to pull it like that so from there we go
to<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.620> next<00:01:02.799> step<00:01:02.979> which<00:01:03.280> is<00:01:03.430> clean<00:01:03.790> as<00:01:04.119> many

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
to the next step which is clean as many

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.530 
to the next step which is clean as many
colors<00:01:04.839> on<00:01:05.229> your<00:01:05.259> claim<00:01:05.680> as<00:01:05.920> muscle<00:01:06.399> so<00:01:07.330> next

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
colors on your claim as muscle so next

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.779 
colors on your claim as muscle so next
we're<00:01:07.899> going<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.200> choose<00:01:09.130> from<00:01:09.369> two<00:01:09.580> different

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
we're going to choose from two different

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.660

person<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.050> same<00:01:23.319> so<00:01:23.920> when<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.429> do<00:01:24.640> have

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909

this<00:01:25.119> option<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:25.869> know<00:01:25.929> it's<00:01:26.350> tough<00:01:26.649> because

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
this option I know it's tough because

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.999 
this option I know it's tough because
you<00:01:27.069> want<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.520> pile<00:01:28.060> your<00:01:28.420> plate<00:01:28.720> high<00:01:28.990> but<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
only thing to remember is that your body

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.139 
only thing to remember is that your body
cannot<00:01:32.259> digest<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:33.130> amount<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> food<00:01:33.789> you're

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149
