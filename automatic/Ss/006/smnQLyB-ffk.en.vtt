boxes left over which is more than

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.590 
boxes left over which is more than
enough<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:56.590> us<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.890> go<00:02:57.040> ahead<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.640> do<00:02:58.390> the

this type before very first time I ever

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.580 
this type before very first time I ever
use<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:13.360> was<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.720> new<00:03:13.960> that<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.290> had<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
use this it was so new that you had to

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.520 
use this it was so new that you had to
glue<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.190> floor<00:03:15.460> together<00:03:15.960> and<00:03:16.960> thank<00:03:17.290> God

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
glue the floor together and thank God

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.670 
glue the floor together and thank God
they've<00:03:17.800> come<00:03:18.040> up<00:03:18.070> with<00:03:18.220> ways<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:20.320> lock

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
they've come up with ways that we lock

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
they've come up with ways that we lock
it<00:03:20.860> together<00:03:22.110> without<00:03:23.110> having<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.770> use<00:03:23.950> glue

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
it together without having to use glue

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.650 
it together without having to use glue
but<00:03:26.350> if<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.530> look<00:03:26.740> at<00:03:26.890> these<00:03:27.040> edges<00:03:27.250> here<00:03:27.660> get

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
but if you look at these edges here get

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.910 
but if you look at these edges here get
it<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> light<00:03:29.170> here<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.410> little<00:03:29.590> bit<00:03:29.710> more

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
it in the light here a little bit more

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.460 
it in the light here a little bit more
so<00:03:30.130> you<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.340> see<00:03:32.400> look<00:03:33.400> at<00:03:33.550> these<00:03:33.700> edges

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
so you can see look at these edges

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.370 
so you can see look at these edges
you'll<00:03:35.470> see<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:35.860> they're<00:03:36.010> machined<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:37.990> snap

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
you'll see that they're machined to snap

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.660 
you'll see that they're machined to snap
together<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.450> then<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.140> end<00:03:41.290> pieces<00:03:41.680> as<00:03:42.160> are

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
together and then the end pieces as are

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.890 
together and then the end pieces as are
machined<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.940> piece<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.360> going<00:03:46.570> on

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
machined so that the piece is going on

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.390 
machined so that the piece is going on
the<00:03:47.020> end<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.470> snap<00:03:47.770> together<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.220> what

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the end can snap together this is what

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.920 
the end can snap together this is what
we<00:03:51.520> have<00:03:51.730> them<00:03:51.910> throughout<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.480> house<00:03:52.660> in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
we have them throughout the house in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.650 
we have them throughout the house in
fact<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.260> other<00:03:53.410> bathroom<00:03:54.390> they've<00:03:55.390> already

these pieces are four feet long and what
we're<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.120> do<00:04:09.330> start<00:04:10.330> here<00:04:11.170> at<00:04:11.350> this

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
we're going to do start here at this

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.970 
we're going to do start here at this
edge<00:04:12.420> because<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.660> is<00:04:13.870> probably<00:04:14.080> our<00:04:14.530> truest

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
edge because this is probably our truest

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.640 
edge because this is probably our truest
edge<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.460> edge<00:04:15.700> along<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.690> bathroom<00:04:17.200> over

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
edge this edge along the bathroom over

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.070 
edge this edge along the bathroom over
here<00:04:17.680> at<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.100> collar<00:04:18.540> because<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.810> always

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
here at the collar because you always

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.930 
here at the collar because you always
want<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.320> start

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
want to start

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.570 
want to start
the<00:04:21.180> square<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:25.200> if<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.470> look<00:04:25.680> at<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.040> you<00:04:26.550> can

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
the square and if I look at it you can

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.140 
the square and if I look at it you can
see<00:04:27.560> it's<00:04:28.560> fairly<00:04:28.800> square<00:04:29.220> what<00:04:29.700> I've<00:04:29.820> done<00:04:30.000> in

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
see it's fairly square what I've done in

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.070 
see it's fairly square what I've done in
the<00:04:30.210> bathroom<00:04:30.390> was<00:04:30.720> before<00:04:32.900> some<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
the bathroom was before some of the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.110 
the bathroom was before some of the
people<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.500> put<00:04:34.680> these<00:04:34.890> down<00:04:35.130> put<00:04:36.090> a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
people that put these down put a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000 
people that put these down put a
transition<00:04:36.840> piece<00:04:37.140> on<00:04:37.440> here

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
transition piece on here

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.060 
transition piece on here
and<00:04:38.190> what<00:04:38.400> I<00:04:38.430> find<00:04:38.790> when<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.210> do<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:40.800> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
and what I find when you do that is the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.250 
and what I find when you do that is the
water<00:04:41.370> gets<00:04:41.670> down<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.180> underneath<00:04:42.420> tends<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
water gets down and underneath tends to

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.790 
water gets down and underneath tends to
have<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.590> warp<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:45.270> what<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.200> do<00:04:46.410> in<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
have it warp and what I do in a

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.780 
have it warp and what I do in a
situation<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.740> take<00:04:50.220> off<00:04:50.460> the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
situation like this is I take off the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.780 
situation like this is I take off the
little<00:04:51.120> lip<00:04:51.510> edge<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.320> guy<00:04:53.010> dams<00:04:53.340> at<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.610> moss

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
little lip edge the guy dams at the moss

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.980 
little lip edge the guy dams at the moss
together<00:04:54.530> I'll<00:04:55.530> cut<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:55.950> off<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.690> this

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
together I'll cut this off so that this

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.070 
together I'll cut this off so that this
is<00:04:58.140> flush<00:04:58.410> up<00:04:58.620> against<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.690> then<00:05:00.840> once

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
is flush up against it and then once

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.910 
is flush up against it and then once
it's<00:05:01.350> done<00:05:02.030> is<00:05:03.030> mostly<00:05:03.900> blended<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.650> as<00:05:04.770> we

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
it's done is mostly blended to it as we

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.150 
it's done is mostly blended to it as we
can<00:05:05.100> do<00:05:05.720> we'll<00:05:06.720> cop<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.260> with<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> silicon

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
can do we'll cop that with a silicon

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.080 
can do we'll cop that with a silicon
caulk<00:05:08.660> now<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.690> silicon<00:05:10.380> clock<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.820> clock

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
caulk now a silicon clock is a clock

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.380 
caulk now a silicon clock is a clock
that<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:13.440> waterproof<00:05:14.160> some<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.210> newer

water washable ones claim to be but I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.380 
water washable ones claim to be but I

program<00:05:39.660> we're<00:05:39.930> going<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.200> do<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.919> install

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
program we're going to do to install

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.140 
program we're going to do to install
this<00:05:42.169> we<00:05:43.169> install<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:44.419> by<00:05:45.419> taking<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.960> piece

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
this we install it by taking a piece

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.800 
this we install it by taking a piece
adding<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.870> next<00:05:49.200> piece<00:05:49.410> from<00:05:49.650> here<00:05:50.810> starting

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
adding the next piece from here starting

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.230 
adding the next piece from here starting
that<00:05:51.960> over<00:05:52.260> here<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.530> stagger<00:05:53.130> them<00:05:53.460> as<00:05:53.730> we<00:05:54.060> go

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
that over here and stagger them as we go

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.060 
that over here and stagger them as we go
down<00:05:54.980> so<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:57.570> other<00:05:57.750> thing<00:05:58.080> is<00:05:58.110> once<00:05:58.650> we<00:05:58.860> get

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
down so the other thing is once we get

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.840 
down so the other thing is once we get
to<00:05:59.520> where<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:01.680> toilet<00:06:02.250> is

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.260 

cutting<00:06:07.630> putting<00:06:08.290> together<00:06:08.730> but<00:06:09.730> when<00:06:09.940> we<00:06:10.060> get

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
cutting putting together but when we get

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.590 
cutting putting together but when we get
down<00:06:10.540> to<00:06:11.050> this<00:06:11.500> area<00:06:11.770> here<00:06:12.270> will<00:06:13.270> be<00:06:13.390> like

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
down to this area here will be like

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.960 
down to this area here will be like
using<00:06:14.080> less<00:06:14.290> than<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.620> four<00:06:14.920> inch<00:06:15.130> piece<00:06:15.490> before

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
using less than a four inch piece before

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.930 
using less than a four inch piece before
for<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.540> piece<00:06:17.130> but<00:06:18.130> what<00:06:18.310> we<00:06:18.430> need<00:06:18.610> to<00:06:18.760> know

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
for the piece but what we need to know

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.990 
for the piece but what we need to know
is<00:06:19.410> how<00:06:20.410> many<00:06:20.680> pieces<00:06:21.130> are<00:06:21.490> we<00:06:21.610> going<00:06:21.790> to<00:06:21.850> have

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
is how many pieces are we going to have

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.200 
is how many pieces are we going to have
to<00:06:22.120> have<00:06:22.270> here<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:22.930> to<00:06:23.230> cut<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:24.090> need<00:06:25.090> to

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
to have here and to cut I need to

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.010 
to have here and to cut I need to
measure<00:06:25.450> this<00:06:25.780> distance<00:06:27.420> and<00:06:28.420> we<00:06:28.630> are<00:06:28.750> looking

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
measure this distance and we are looking

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.440 
measure this distance and we are looking
at<00:06:29.170> 33<00:06:29.920> pitches<00:06:30.250> roughly<00:06:31.830> these<00:06:32.880> boards<00:06:35.070> or

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
at 33 pitches roughly these boards or

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:44.700 
at 33 pitches roughly these boards or
for<00:06:37.450> use<00:06:37.720> is<00:06:38.290> about<00:06:38.530> 7<00:06:39.220> and<00:06:41.820> 3/8<00:06:43.560> that's<00:06:44.560> the

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
for use is about 7 and 3/8 that's the

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:52.550 
for use is about 7 and 3/8 that's the
invisible<00:06:45.070> surface<00:06:45.880> that<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.240> see<00:06:47.610> so<00:06:49.530> at<00:06:50.530> 33

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
invisible surface that you see so at 33

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.640 
invisible surface that you see so at 33
we're<00:06:53.560> primarily<00:06:53.830> going<00:06:54.400> to<00:06:54.460> be<00:06:54.520> putting<00:06:55.650> four

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
we're primarily going to be putting four

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.950 
we're primarily going to be putting four
pieces<00:06:56.950> down<00:06:57.430> with<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.270> land<00:06:58.480> when<00:06:58.600> it's<00:06:58.720> over

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
pieces down with the land when it's over

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.390 
pieces down with the land when it's over
the<00:06:59.050> end<00:06:59.200> and<00:06:59.410> having<00:06:59.590> do<00:06:59.800> a<00:06:59.830> little<00:07:00.130> cutting

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
the end and having do a little cutting

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.690 
the end and having do a little cutting
over<00:07:00.820> here<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:02.830> we're<00:07:02.980> gonna<00:07:03.100> get<00:07:03.250> some<00:07:03.460> pieces

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
over here so we're gonna get some pieces

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:13.020 
over here so we're gonna get some pieces
and<00:07:03.880> just<00:07:04.210> dry<00:07:04.480> lay<00:07:04.750> them<00:07:04.990> down<00:07:05.020> right<00:07:05.530> now

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030
