00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.220
 the cash of the cia is a priority 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.080
 located and taking out less we carry 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.689
 with lives 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.689
 I admit that good activity 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
 goes recon future soldier is the third 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.300
 delivery of the series that reaches us in 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.640
 this generation the tom clancy brand 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.730
 It has always been a safe bet 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.530
 rainbow six fox and ghost recon are 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.449
 franchises that can surprise more or 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.699
 less but if something is certain it is that 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.140
 never fail let's take a look at this 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.420
 new approach to the best action 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 strategic of ubisoft and pussy 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.620
 i 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.829
 and with me 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.829
 but there is not a line 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.970
 we are part of an elite team 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.530
 ghost the most delicate situations or 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.660
 those that can not appear in the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.820
 papers always end under the point of 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.500
 look at these four soldiers the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.810
 history of future soldier returns to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 always at the beginning of the adventure 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.400
 USA loses four men who form 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.990
 part of our same strength when stopping 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.050
 the passage of a bomb that entered the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.940
 country as of that moment those four 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.920
 men are replaced and they will put the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.630
 world upside down to find the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 responsible for that attack 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.719
 ready mister very well then let's go for 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.470
 those responsible for this have details 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.470
 in the tablets 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.730
 as always there are people kidnapped 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 international threats bombs 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.180
 nuclear and other situations 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.800
 spectacular that could come out of 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.250
 any Hollywood blockbuster 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.250
 moment 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.310
 much much 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.680
 'I did bucaramanga nacos be careful with that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.680
 boy we might need it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.330
 if you have played either of the two 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.160
 first 2 bricons you will see that the base of 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.380
 the game mechanics is practically the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.390
 same in this franchise is so 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.640
 important the action as the strategy 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.890
 and if you do not master both you will not go to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.890
 no part when you want 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.240
 you are not going to miss the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.250
 direct confrontation with the forces 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.230
 enemies you will always carry two weapons 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.870
 over which you will choose depending on the type 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.550
 of mission that you are going to start and you will do 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.890
 good use of a coverage system that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.020
 works perfectly but remember 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 that you are an elite team and always 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.530
 before reaching the open fire, you have to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.520
 try to stay in the shade 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.520
 as long as possible 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.190
 with the idea that this is how to handle that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.540
 will to the four members of 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.400
 your squadron 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.920
 you carry sensor-shaped devices 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.420
 or spy robot capable of analyzing the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 environment in a matter of seconds 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.159
 revealing the position of the enemies 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 when you have that information you will have 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.920
 than to find the most effective way to 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.480
 proceed 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.980
 You can set goals so that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.019
 your partners finish with them 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.329
 while you board some 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.670
 Clueless soldier in the back or 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.590
 directly mark four objectives and 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.970
 be part of that action at a distance 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.970
 with a synchronized shot 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.300
 the most important thing is that no one is left 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.270
 standing that can find a corpse and 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.160
 alert the rest of the soldiers that is a 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.530
 broad strokes the general tone of the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.060
 ghost recon missions in the first 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.340
 part of each mission your team 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.750
 should remain in the shade and if 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.300
 someone discover us the mission will be 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.890
 finished many times is not easy there 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.200
 many enemies and you have to find 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.660
 the way they all fall without 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.160
 none come to realize for it 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.740
 you will have the mentioned devices 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.510
 before a good range of visions like 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.860
 the thermal or the night that they will give you 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.410
 certain advantage depending on the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.940
 circumstances and a camouflage system 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.940
 optical that only works when you 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.260
 move crouched and very slowly 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.290
 they really are tools that give a lot 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.290
 game 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.470
 the palm does not 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.870
 will come a moment in the mission in the 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.540
 that betraying your position will not be a 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.190
 problem from that moment you can 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.560
 Remove the silencers and remove the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.810
 heavy artillery because you will have everything 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.100
 an army looking for the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.870
 orders that you give to the soldiers of 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.639
 your team will be direct death 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.380
 they will not wait until the order of 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.080
 final execution because the life of the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.510
 team is in danger if someone falls in 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.120
 combat you should help him and if you want 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.480
 you will approach to get in 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.480
 stand again 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.370
 there are special missions like in all 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.020
 the tom clancy game that you play 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.360
 control of a position machine gun 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.100
 from a helicopter to a jeep and some 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.380
 even more special like this one in which 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.180
 you give orders to a robot bomber in 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.650
 which really is very clear 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.650
 futuristic cut of your team 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.560
 the customization of weapons is also 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.270
 a point to highlight there are thousands of 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.000
 pieces that you can fit in the tens 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.190
 of available weapons these pieces help 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.860
 to have more stability more reach 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.500
 greater impact power or reduction of 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.940
 noise among other things you should think 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.370
 in your needs before 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.590
 start the mission once I started jce 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.480
 you can only do ammo in 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.790
 specific points or directly change 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.350
 the weapon for some that you find but 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.350
 it is impossible to modify 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.589
 the ghost campaign recon future soldier 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.749
 offers more than eight hours of intense 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:00.089
 strategic action now the 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.979
 fun does not end there in the first place 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.379
 the possibility of playing the campaign in 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.699
 cooperative multiplayer mode makes 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.520
 the idea of raising the level of difficulty 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.319
 get a lot of interest beyond the 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.209
 cooperative you will find four modes of 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.399
 showdown for up to 12 players 

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:16.499
 They offer 10 endless maps 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:19.879
 conflict what will keep the disk in 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.879
 the console a few more months 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.750
 we are ciro 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:34.740
 you see that at a graphic level 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.080
 ubisoft franchise complies as 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.090
 you have always done it, you may not 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.860
 be the best you have seen but 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.509
 cosmic has not been able to position itself between 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.880
 the best of the moment whenever he has 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.979
 the constructions arrived at the market 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.560
 they are solid and the textures get that 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.300
 certain effects like the 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.280
 rain or snow and sand storms 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.650
 they are most gimmicky that we have seen 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.509
 in time and motion capture in combat 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.060
 of the characters is very successful 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.530
 also the weak point lies perhaps in 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.120
 the video sequences where the 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.639
 modeled characters lose a 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.130
 little with respect to everything else the 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.259
 soundtrack for its part works and the 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.970
 Spanish dubbing is very good 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.260
 saving certain moments in which 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:18.650
 it can be something forced you do not go 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:23.500
 by telling them how it really happened 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.500
 the subversion is much lower 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.380
 together 2 wii with future soldier me 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.020
 it seems a game of the most recommendable 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.790
 the combination between stealth action and 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.860
 strategy makes the experience of 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.380
 game is much richer than what 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.540
 we used to find that added 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.160
 an almost endless online mode and a 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.450
 technical section that knows how to take good 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.820
 performance of the hardware that is 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.750
 driving I would do with this game without 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.750
 doubt it too 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.420
 white destroyed we will go back but
