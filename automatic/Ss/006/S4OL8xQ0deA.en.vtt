hi my name is al Ulrich and I've been an

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi my name is al Ulrich and I've been an
aquarist<00:00:06.660> for<00:00:06.870> over<00:00:07.020> 23<00:00:07.529> years<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.040> I'm<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
aquarist for over 23 years and I'm the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.740 
author of saltwater aquarium blog.com I
want<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.880> share<00:00:12.059> with<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.360> today<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
want to share with you today and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.660 
want to share with you today and
methadone<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> proper<00:00:13.830> recycling

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
methadone had a proper recycling

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.310 
methadone had a proper recycling
so<00:00:16.059> this<00:00:16.270> would<00:00:16.420> be<00:00:16.510> for<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.750> new<00:00:16.930> tank<00:00:17.170> that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
so this would be for a new tank that

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.540 
so this would be for a new tank that
you're<00:00:17.470> setting<00:00:17.800> up<00:00:17.920> whether<00:00:18.310> it's<00:00:18.490> a

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
you're setting up whether it's a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.240 
you're setting up whether it's a
freshwater<00:00:18.820> tank<00:00:19.360> or<00:00:19.600> a<00:00:19.660> saltwater<00:00:20.140> tank<00:00:20.380> so

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
freshwater tank or a saltwater tank so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.760 
freshwater tank or a saltwater tank so
what<00:00:22.060> you<00:00:22.180> need<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.360> know<00:00:22.600> is<00:00:22.810> that<00:00:22.870> any<00:00:23.440> time

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
what you need to know is that any time

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.220 
what you need to know is that any time
you're<00:00:24.310> juicing<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.880> fish<00:00:25.150> into<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.510> tank<00:00:25.810> what

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
you're juicing a fish into a tank what

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.870 
you're juicing a fish into a tank what
they<00:00:26.380> do<00:00:26.440> is<00:00:26.680> they<00:00:26.800> release<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.160> toxic<00:00:27.700> chemical

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
they do is they release a toxic chemical

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.090 
they do is they release a toxic chemical
called<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.689> moment<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.290> if<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.800> ammonia

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
called a moment and if the ammonia

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.830 
called a moment and if the ammonia
builds<00:00:30.550> up<00:00:30.640> in<00:00:30.790> the<00:00:30.880> tank<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.420> can<00:00:31.689> actually

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
builds up in the tank it can actually

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.900 
builds up in the tank it can actually
injure<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.470> fish<00:00:32.710> or<00:00:32.950> even<00:00:33.010> kill<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.700> fish

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
injure the fish or even kill the fish

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.860 
injure the fish or even kill the fish
and<00:00:34.150> this<00:00:34.570> problem<00:00:34.870> is<00:00:35.110> maybe<00:00:35.380> worse<00:00:36.100> in<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.600> new

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
and this problem is maybe worse in a new

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.440 
and this problem is maybe worse in a new
tank<00:00:38.200> because<00:00:38.590> there<00:00:39.010> isn't<00:00:39.310> a<00:00:39.610> biological

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
tank because there isn't a biological

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.120 
tank because there isn't a biological
filter<00:00:40.780> to<00:00:40.960> help<00:00:40.990> get<00:00:41.320> rid<00:00:41.560> of<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:41.829> ammonia

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
filter to help get rid of that ammonia

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.490 
filter to help get rid of that ammonia
so<00:00:42.730> what<00:00:42.880> we<00:00:43.030> need<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.270> do<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.630> aquarist<00:00:44.110> it

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
so what we need to do is aquarist it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.830 
so what we need to do is aquarist it
cycle<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.190> tank<00:00:45.370> before<00:00:46.150> we<00:00:46.300> put<00:00:46.510> our<00:00:46.540> first

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
cycle the tank before we put our first

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.549 
cycle the tank before we put our first
fish<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:49.120> cycling<00:00:49.480> process<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.050> easy<00:00:50.260> all

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
fish and the cycling process is easy all

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.410 
fish and the cycling process is easy all
you're<00:00:50.710> doing<00:00:51.039> is<00:00:51.370> adding<00:00:51.520> ammonia<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
you're doing is adding ammonia to the

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.740 
you're doing is adding ammonia to the
tank<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.920> allowing<00:00:54.399> it<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.609> cycle<00:00:54.850> before<00:00:55.629> you

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
tank but allowing it to cycle before you

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.170 
tank but allowing it to cycle before you
add<00:00:55.870> first<00:00:56.199> fish<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:57.100> as<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> source<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.879> ammonia

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
add first fish so as a source of ammonia

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180 
add first fish so as a source of ammonia
what<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.420> like<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.719> do<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.170> inch<00:00:59.500> fish

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
what I like to do with that inch fish

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.959 
what I like to do with that inch fish
food<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.899> a<00:01:01.929> piece<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.410> fish<00:01:03.129> meat<00:01:03.460> so<00:01:03.730> it's<00:01:03.910> a

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
food for a piece of fish meat so it's a

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.740 
food for a piece of fish meat so it's a
piece<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.180> table<00:01:04.660> shrimp<00:01:04.989> or<00:01:05.410> small<00:01:05.830> piece

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
piece of table shrimp or small piece

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.300 
piece of table shrimp or small piece
fresh<00:01:07.750> fish<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.290> might<00:01:08.470> have<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.950> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
fresh fish that you might have and I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
fresh fish that you might have and I
would<00:01:09.550> introduce<00:01:09.760> that<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.420> tank

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
would introduce that to the tank

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
would introduce that to the tank
and<00:01:11.060> purposefully<00:01:12.060> allow<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.600> fat<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and purposefully allow it to fat so the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.620 
and purposefully allow it to fat so the
next<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.610> need<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
next thing you need to do is you need to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.770 
next thing you need to do is you need to
be<00:01:15.810> testing<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.680> ammonia<00:01:17.570> nitrites<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
be testing for ammonia nitrites and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.440 
be testing for ammonia nitrites and
nitrates<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.460> you'll<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> tank

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
nitrates and what you'll see as a tank

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
nitrates and what you'll see as a tank
cycle<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.229> as<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> progresses<00:01:22.860> through<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
cycle there as it progresses through the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.460 
cycle there as it progresses through the
cycle<00:01:23.700> it'll<00:01:24.149> start<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.930> food<00:01:25.140> fouls

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cycle it'll start as the food fouls

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.430 
cycle it'll start as the food fouls
you'll<00:01:26.100> get<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> spike<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.030> moon<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.930> toxic

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
you'll get a spike of a moon and a toxic

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.480 
you'll get a spike of a moon and a toxic
and<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:28.799> happen<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> were<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and that would happen if you were to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.039 
and that would happen if you were to
introduce<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.270> fish<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:30.960> were

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
introduce your first fish but we were

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.080 
introduce your first fish but we were
smarter<00:01:31.500> than<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.549> introduced

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
smarter than that and we just introduced

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.580 
smarter than that and we just introduced
an<00:01:33.330> ammonia<00:01:33.720> source<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:35.009> living

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
an ammonia source not a living

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.830 
an ammonia source not a living
so<00:01:36.710> after<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.310> ammonia<00:01:37.700> spike<00:01:37.939> goes<00:01:38.509> away

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
so after the ammonia spike goes away

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.499 
so after the ammonia spike goes away
you'll<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.590> spike<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.039> nitrite<00:01:40.579> followed

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
you'll see a spike of nitrite followed

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.749 
you'll see a spike of nitrite followed
finally<00:01:41.929> by<00:01:42.109> a<00:01:42.140> spike<00:01:42.409> of<00:01:42.560> nitrate<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.250> once

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
finally by a spike of nitrate and once

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.219 
finally by a spike of nitrate and once
you<00:01:44.030> progress<00:01:44.270> all<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.659> way<00:01:44.780> through<00:01:45.109> that

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
you progress all the way through that

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.399 
you progress all the way through that
cycle<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.100> nitrate<00:01:46.609> spike<00:01:47.020> your<00:01:48.020> tank<00:01:48.259> is

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409
