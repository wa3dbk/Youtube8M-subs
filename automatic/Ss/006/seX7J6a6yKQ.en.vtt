that aside if you like while we change
the<00:02:09.440> battery<00:02:10.930> you'll<00:02:11.930> notice<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.530> wiring<00:02:13.400> is

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
the battery you'll notice the wiring is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.869 
the battery you'll notice the wiring is
tucked<00:02:15.440> away<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.549> front<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.030> battery

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
tucked away at the front of the battery

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.550 
tucked away at the front of the battery
so<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:19.910> when<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.510> cover<00:02:20.959> goes<00:02:21.140> on<00:02:21.410> it
