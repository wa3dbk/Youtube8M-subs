things<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:47.549> even<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.149> he's<00:01:48.299> doing

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
things I don't even know what he's doing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.520 
things I don't even know what he's doing
is<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.630> switching<00:01:49.049> from<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.439> other

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is just switching from one to the other

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
is just switching from one to the other
I<00:01:49.890> guess<00:01:50.189> he<00:01:50.280> can't<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.670> decide<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
I guess he can't really decide then it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.510 
I guess he can't really decide then it
is<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.899> biggest<00:01:52.500> compilation<00:01:53.130> trick<00:01:53.310> shots

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
