00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 people, if this is another matter really 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.620
 controversy among suckers 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.620
 by the way is the taco sowell tacos 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 today we are going to talk about a subject that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 enough discussion when the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 m theme is approached somewhere 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 after all, what is the correct pronunciation of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 That these guys use it so much, I'll 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 start talking about it 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 I am answering a question I ask myself one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 Sometimes it goes because you do not sing. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.820
 In japanese 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:46.340
 good is why the ones who do not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.340
 Do you know what happened? 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 sérgio rocco casket bathed in the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 it does not make sense having and she does not 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.430
 look the music may be in the mind 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.159
 played very well after it is played. 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.110
 really very beautiful but Portuguese is 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.460
 worse than a four year old 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.740
 with mental retardation 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 but there you will say that there is in itself only the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.440
 her car 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.070
 Good, we have the pack there too. 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.070
 japanese 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 it's bad to complete 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 with her 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.480
 It's soft what we can conclude with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.670
 these two videos 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.800
 Look at either one or the Japanese are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.110
 shitting solemnly for pronunciation 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.450
 correct of the words in Portuguese 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.520
 or he simply really believe 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 who are singing it right and it's for 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.600
 I do not sing Japanese because I 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.360
 I do not know how to speak Japanese 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 and even if I tried to imitate what I 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 I thought I was singing right 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 He's probably singing. 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.990
 wrong as it had been pointing and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270
 Portuguese 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.920
 you also do not speak Japanese could 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.869
 listen to Japanese singing and think that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.530
 also never so wrong so ok 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.390
 sure only that a real Japanese who 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.670
 grew up speaking Japanese living with 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.550
 other Japanese listen to me if I notice 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.350
 probably he would think which 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.150
 problem because he does not know 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.970
 speak for example how he died because 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.760
 shimane huamanga jeans on naga he kicks 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.650
 to me it sounds right but probably 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 I made several mistakes that I did not even 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 I realized our everything came back video so I 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.860
 I really do not think the Japanese are 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.080
 matter a lot with correct pronunciation of the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.120
 words that are not dilma of them 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 People already saw this in Portuguese 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.769
 but the Englishman that they live 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.780
 mixing in their songs look is not 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.640
 not at all in common to find an English 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.210
 completely wrong not only in the province 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.280
 as in the screen itself 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.440
 knows how to commit serious grammatical errors 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.540
 Where do I want to go with all this? 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.940
 how simple it is actually if the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.680
 each one for the way they are 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.960
 pronounce the words of tongues 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.390
 foreigners because we care about 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.380
 both in pronouncing themselves to tim as they 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.630
 they do not want to imitate if there 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.610
 Japanese culture sometimes does not 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.280
 values ​​both good Japanese culture 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.110
 so it's almost cultural for him 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.300
 pick up words from other languages ​​and 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.420
 adapting Japanese as if it were a 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.210
 Japanese word for example of sewage 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.250
 It was a coincidence that it works. 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.620
 being right this goal is not as if 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.710
 would have become a word in Japanese 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.940
 they do it even with the names 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.460
 Eduardo Henrique, right? 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.830
 eduardo feld this name is not japanese is 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.810
 so I can see all this can even be 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.480
 that in Japan trade is to speak of the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.370
 because the last tonic syllable is 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.100
 All that history but here in Brazil 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.840
 if we are in that word 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.790
 Naturally we 'll read on me and me. 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.190
 I see it as a word of origin 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.830
 but it was appropriate for the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.670
 our vocabulary of the same thing is 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.070
 to put kauai at last may not be the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.690
 correct pronunciation in Japan but it is as if 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.780
 we had incorporated these 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.640
 words to provoke bulário in brazilian 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.350
 to Portuguese is not very different 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.780
 what happens with youtube by 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.510
 example or you quit speaking and a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.280
 club or any member of this type or 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.280
 I know what business law is anyway 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.080
 the Americans did not speak in October 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.780
 I pronounce this way we 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.210
 practically took the name and appropriated the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.940
 our vocabulary this happens in every 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.100
 multilingual and multi-language 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.010
 The words here in Brazil have several 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.540
 things that we adapt and incorporate 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.550
 for our language but also has 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.920
 many things we try to talk about 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.750
 a more foreign form and I do not 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.330
 I'm trying to say that in this video that 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.710
 You can not talk back with an anime. 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.420
 you can 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.640
 I just want to show that it does not 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.190
 sense to discuss such a thing 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.350
 because neither side actually I 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.900
 I am defending more here on the side of 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.760
 pronunciation of words because 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.040
 I think that who usually involves more 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.720
 with the pronunciation of these things is that 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.419
 People who try to speak the same way. 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.160
 Japanese, seriously, it does not have 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.650
 no importance to know is a matter 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.680
 as relevant as here to discuss whether 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.690
 the meeting is not drawing because it is drawing 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.820
 so it's only design that people 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.620
 had a team more to differentiate only 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.580
 It's not wrong to call it December. 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.110
 We 'll even have a 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.479
 complementarity in the question of names 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.000
 As I said in your blog about louis 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.320
 think I call the diagonal gome 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.960
 Cape Verde 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.900
 if the Japanese themselves do not care 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.820
 to call Eduardo Eduard Felix and 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.150
 olic 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.710
 is a Japanese man and the rest of the world 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.560
 do not care for example the so-called 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.640
 neymar because we do not 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.850
 You can say the wrong thing by becoming a man. 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.410
 foreigner knows is quite common 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.530
 this kind of thing happens with halo 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.050
 something that is not from our language is 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.150
 most likely the elton losing me 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.420
 I think you understand, right? 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.940
 is common in these provinces is changed 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.860
 by foreigners because we try to 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.840
 incorporate in our language your name 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.820
 indicated for example want to see all the 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.400
 united states and american 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.070
 had modified not from Ricardo 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.830
 so to report I grew up watching 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.530
 bank akira and talking anime clients 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.540
 so if the daughter spoke in the anime it is 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.280
 way to myself and fuck i hope 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.300
 have contributed at least a little to 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.730
 the reduction of these discussions 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.950
 unnecessary or by correct pronunciation 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.620
 of things because the primordial question 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.780
 that this is all you are no more or 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.210
 less fans of a thing by the way 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.370
 a pronuncio she is this is given the message 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.680
 you have every right to disagree 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.450
 solemnly of my opinion may leave 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.220
 comments on education if not me 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.960
 I'm going to pay because that's what it 's like 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.790
 dictatorship be sure to check our 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.670
 last videos on our last back 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.710
 our last jack government blog stayed 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.800
 really really cool is in the 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.600
 channel that every week has new video 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.790
 curtin shares shows with your 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.130
 friends shows that his friend that he 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.830
 discussing about pronunciations to 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.570
 he may change 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.040
 or not for them to agree to withdraw 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.420
 the comments to have your comment 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.070
 maybe deleted 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.600
 anyway share this 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.870
 video can be a utility service 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.570
 public because it is something that people 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.000
 really look around in these discussions and 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.770
 they are not so important then in 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.510
 It's true what I want to spread here. 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.620
 here you do not have to discuss the 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.720
 third is cool 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.730
 you can discuss the importance of 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.250
 or not of manifests 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.490
 things that are a little more relevant to the 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.560
 who had a certain conversation or grandson 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.300
 then it is expected until next week 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.300
 Good and go for the shade.
