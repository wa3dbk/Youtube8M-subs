00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080 

least<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.599> had<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:00.810> momentum<00:00:01.260> back<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.589> here

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.090 
least you had the momentum back on here

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.210 
least you had the momentum back on here
yeah<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.300> was<00:00:03.589> tough<00:00:04.589> sledding

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
yeah it was tough sledding

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.480 
yeah it was tough sledding
they<00:00:05.910> played<00:00:06.770> something<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.859> hadn't<00:00:08.130> prepared

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
they played something we hadn't prepared

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.990 
they played something we hadn't prepared
for<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.059> took<00:00:09.210> quite<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.450> bit<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.840> jump

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
for so it took quite a bit of a jump

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.900 
for so it took quite a bit of a jump
they<00:00:12.000> were<00:00:12.059> playing<00:00:12.990> right<00:00:13.889> yeah<00:00:14.519> up<00:00:14.639> front

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
they were playing right yeah up front

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.760 
they were playing right yeah up front
they<00:00:15.089> were<00:00:15.150> playing<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.630> double<00:00:16.199> eagle<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.650> they

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
they were playing a double eagle so they

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580 
they were playing a double eagle so they
were<00:00:16.980> covering<00:00:17.699> our<00:00:17.820> Center<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.869> both<00:00:19.140> guards

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
were covering our Center and both guards

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.880 
were covering our Center and both guards
and<00:00:20.490> basically<00:00:20.820> playing<00:00:21.199> cover<00:00:22.199> zero<00:00:22.500> behind

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and basically playing cover zero behind

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
and basically playing cover zero behind
it<00:00:26.210> yeah<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> mean<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.990> damn<00:00:28.800> near<00:00:28.980> impossible

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it yeah I mean it's damn near impossible

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
it yeah I mean it's damn near impossible
and<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.090> had<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> find<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.560> ways<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.920> get

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and so we had to find some ways to get

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.580 
and so we had to find some ways to get
to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> speed<00:00:33.120> option<00:00:33.450> game<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:34.469> that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to the speed option game and we did that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
to the speed option game and we did that
there<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> second<00:00:35.340> half<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.270> little

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
there in the second half got a little

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.240 
there in the second half got a little
momentum<00:00:37.200> back<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.829> our<00:00:37.950> side<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:40.100> could<00:00:41.100> make

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
momentum back on our side and could make

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.550 
momentum back on our side and could make
plays<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.820 

no<00:00:48.560> I<00:00:48.590> don't<00:00:49.280> I<00:00:49.430> don't<00:00:49.490> think<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.880> can<00:00:50.830> point

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
no I don't I don't think you can point

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.190 
no I don't I don't think you can point
the<00:00:51.980> finger<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:52.790> Leah<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.330> think<00:00:53.900> that<00:00:54.050> was

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
the finger so Leah that I think that was

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.080 
the finger so Leah that I think that was
a<00:00:54.230> contributing<00:00:54.920> factor<00:00:54.980> at<00:00:55.460> times<00:00:55.730> and

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
a contributing factor at times and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.200 
a contributing factor at times and
obviously<00:00:56.840> we<00:00:57.350> weren't<00:00:58.160> there<00:00:58.340> very<00:00:58.730> accurate

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
obviously we weren't there very accurate

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.270 
obviously we weren't there very accurate
at<00:00:59.330> times<00:00:59.540> at<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.140> quarterback<00:01:00.410> position<00:01:00.560> we

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.560 

looked<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.400> proper<00:01:04.730> way<00:01:04.880> at<00:01:05.089> times<00:01:05.330> at

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
looked the proper way at times at

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.290 
looked the proper way at times at
quarterback<00:01:06.050> position<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
quarterback position and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.910 
quarterback position and
we<00:01:08.390> were<00:01:08.870> looking<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.170> right<00:01:09.380> way<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.800> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
we were looking the right way and the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.260 
we were looking the right way and the
receiver<00:01:10.340> actually<00:01:10.460> got<00:01:10.760> open<00:01:11.620> protection

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
receiver actually got open protection

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.170 
receiver actually got open protection
you<00:01:14.479> know<00:01:14.600> let<00:01:14.810> us<00:01:14.840> down<00:01:15.109> so<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.530> was<00:01:15.680> a

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
you know let us down so it was a

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
you know let us down so it was a
myself<00:01:18.590> on<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> players<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.670> know

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
myself on down to the players you know

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.850 
myself on down to the players you know
it<00:01:20.940> was<00:01:21.090> certainly<00:01:22.400> not<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:24.000> position<00:01:24.360> one

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
it was certainly not a one position one

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
it was certainly not a one position one
one<00:01:25.860> thing<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.670> say<00:01:27.510> this<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
one thing that you can say this was the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:35.170 
one thing that you can say this was the
reason

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.540 

yeah<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:36.380> was<00:01:38.140> pretty<00:01:39.140> unorthodox<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:40.310> say

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
yeah that was pretty unorthodox I say

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:51.750 
yeah that was pretty unorthodox I say
hey<00:01:40.760> we're<00:01:41.270> gonna

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.630 

with<00:01:52.760> really<00:01:53.120> no<00:01:53.360> gaps<00:01:53.630> inside

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.660 

no<00:01:56.820> double-teams<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.510> front<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.550> really<00:01:59.550> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
no double-teams in front so really the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.640 
no double-teams in front so really the
only<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.060> attack<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.110> speed

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
only way to attack that is is speed

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.719 
only way to attack that is is speed
option

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
option

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:15.880 
option
and<00:02:02.820> throw<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> football

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.830 

so<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.550> was<00:02:16.760> difficult<00:02:16.940> cuz<00:02:17.690> I'm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so that was that was difficult cuz I'm

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.809 
so that was that was difficult cuz I'm
thinking<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> bigger<00:02:18.470> picture<00:02:19.040> because<00:02:19.430> there

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
thinking a bigger picture because there

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.510 
thinking a bigger picture because there
is<00:02:19.990> uncertain<00:02:21.020> all<00:02:21.620> over<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.980> place

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
is uncertain all over the place

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.300 
is uncertain all over the place
well<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.150> don't<00:02:24.330> bigger<00:02:24.540> bigger<00:02:25.500> as<00:02:25.710> relative<00:02:26.190> I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
well I don't bigger bigger as relative I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.630 
well I don't bigger bigger as relative I
guess<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.200> certainly<00:02:29.100> got<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> lot<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
guess you know certainly got a lot to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.970 
guess you know certainly got a lot to
fix<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:34.020> thing<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.470> these

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
fix but you know one thing that these

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.950 
fix but you know one thing that these
kid<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:35.400> kids<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.660> lot<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
kid have kids have is a lot of

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.420 
kid have kids have is a lot of
resiliency<00:02:37.560> they've<00:02:37.740> been<00:02:37.890> trained<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> way

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
resiliency they've been trained that way

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.840 
resiliency they've been trained that way
and<00:02:38.640> they've<00:02:39.540> been<00:02:39.690> trained<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.990> respond<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
and they've been trained to respond and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.480 
and they've been trained to respond and
the<00:02:41.850> right<00:02:42.030> way<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.210> do<00:02:42.870> something<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
the right way to do something that

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.660 
the right way to do something that
something<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.790> happens<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:46.520> get<00:02:47.520> up

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
something like this happens and get up

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.440 
something like this happens and get up
tomorrow<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.480> told<00:02:49.050> my<00:02:49.200> guys<00:02:50.120> let<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.270> one

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
tomorrow and I told my guys let this one

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.850 
tomorrow and I told my guys let this one
hurt<00:02:51.660> tonight<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.470> when<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.770> get
