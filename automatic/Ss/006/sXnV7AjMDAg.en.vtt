00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the focus of the meeting is the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.420
 ask how must the individual 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.080
 body parts spatially to each other 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.240
 behavior 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 so that the body as a whole the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.700
 can use gravity optimally and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.560
 not deformed by her in this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 schematic drawings of a small 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.490
 boys before and after the frequent 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.109
 treatment we see on the right 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 page that focuses the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.820
 individual body parts vertical 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.619
 are arranged one above the other 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.199
 if we have these priorities here 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.870
 connected with each other results 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.739
 a body vertical which coincides 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.410
 with gravity vertical in this 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 case, the upright force affects itself 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.780
 from the resistance of the soil against the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.840
 Body weight is also vertical 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.760
 on the focal points of the body parts 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.129
 the consequence is that man is without 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.289
 a lot of muscular effort vertical 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.780
 can hold 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.980
 We can therefore be of an optimal 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.409
 speak balanced body structure 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.500
 on the left we see like that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.619
 individual body parts of the vertical 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.420
 differ 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 because they are shifted against each other 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.409
 the basin, for example, is after 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.659
 moved back the abdomen and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.009
 the head forward 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.790
 The body structure is out of the lot 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 devices 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 the consequence is that the upright force 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 only partially usable 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.280
 and the human being with muscular strength 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.280
 against gravity must claim 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.259
 optimally balanced 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.750
 body structure expresses itself in graceful 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.250
 and free movement options here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.700
 for example, when bending over 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.330
 This is the best prevention against 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.330
 Back problems and joint wear 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.200
 in contrast, with this type of basin 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 the back muscles and the spine 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.970
 with her slices a tremendous 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.520
 Stress subjected to the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.710
 duration in the form of the body about as 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 spine shows unfavorable 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.009
 motion patterns thus influence 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.929
 in the long term, the body structure is reversed 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.780
 shapes the body structure of a human 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.280
 his very personal way of moving 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 Here I was the man's tank 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.720
 example so strong to the side of that 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.489
 hull balancing with his weight 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.890
 be put on the other side 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.380
 the consequence is that the body 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 constantly enormous forces for an approximate 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 balance must mobilize and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.650
 Wear the hip joints prematurely 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.630
 the body structure of this man is present 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.970
 Everything determines that the basin 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.840
 tilted backwards and forward 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.360
 is moved 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.640
 This makes the chest balance 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.120
 turn back out of the head after 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.519
 front 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.470
 the bandage and muscle tissue in the lower 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.570
 back in the chest and midriff 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.730
 area as well as in the neck is chronic 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.350
 shortens and keeps the body in so 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.480
 his shape as in a corset 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.850
 This older lady proves that one 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.310
 unfavorable body structure even in the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.959
 age can still improve 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.060
 Gerolfing method uses the moldability 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.700
 connective tissue and the ability to learn 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 of the nervous system around these changes 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.829
 to effect in a relatively short time 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.370
 the results are according to experience 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.380
 many people persist frequently 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.810
 have reported from reports 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.600
 positive mental changes like 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.180
 for example greater flexibility more 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.019
 emotional wealth 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.940
 decision-making more 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.620
 serenity 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.640
 Of course this is less easy too 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.709
 document 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.370
 as the structural changes 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.640
 the physically 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.010
 next to when we with this woman the left 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.890
 picture before rolfing with the middle 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.049
 photon 18 rolfink meetings compare 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.900
 we clearly see the erection of the 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.760
 this woman has reached the recording 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.650
 on the right half a year later 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.069
 completion of the basic series and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.659
 shows that the results are permanent 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.769
 the key to change was here 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.079
 the basin position 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.970
 the change of the basin position 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.760
 caused the trunk to lengthen 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.870
 and upright 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.060
 noteworthy is also that of 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.700
 originally far advanced neck and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.840
 head shoulder device better support 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.840
 found a place 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.360
 This young woman has a spine 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.090
 scoliosis that is called the spine 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.949
 laterally curved is connected with 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.400
 a rotation of the vortex around its own 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.289
 longitudinal axis rolfing can and wants one 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.090
 medical treatment of such and 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.100
 similar problems of the spine not 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.810
 replace 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.760
 the more impressive is the improved 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.660
 right balance of the whole 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.919
 body after ten rolfing sessions 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.660
 while before a clear 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.389
 Overweight to the right side 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.940
 the person is now in the 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.440
 balance the whole body and thus 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.950
 also the spine have become 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.950
 stretched 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.760
 This girl started the rolfing 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.020
 treatment at the age of seven 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.820
 Normally, this age has changed 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.700
 the hollow cross, which is typical for toddlers 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.030
 with the tilted forward and down 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.900
 basin already fully grown 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.750
 obviously he is with this 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.940
 child development delayed like this 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.100
 Often rolfing one 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.140
 different reasons delayed maturity 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.700
 physical and mental art again 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.170
 in progress 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.720
 the middle photo became after ten 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.320
 rolfing hours made that right 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.320
 year later 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.720
 while in adult the distance 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.660
 between two rolfing hours usually one 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.530
 Week is often in children 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.030
 make sense to choose larger distances 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.890
 so can kids in their body 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.790
 mental development over one 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:02.370
 longer periods are accompanied 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.260
 This girl is remarkably like 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.390
 the right balance is right 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.490
 has changed and also the rotation of the 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:12.200
 body around its own longitudinal axis 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.200
 left completely disappeared
