00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.890
 good afternoon 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.810
 before school recorded faith and joy 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.180
 our group is made up of me 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.950
 compañera maría valentina verisign who 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.110
 Francisco Javier Navarro speaks to them 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.170
 the experiment that we are going to present 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.600
 Below is how to do what is it 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 material is that we are going to use are a 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.660
 milk room preferably that is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.450
 whole a tablespoon of vinegar a jar 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.579
 with its respective coffee filter stage and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 another after he breaks who was his first step 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.790
 we invest the milk in the jar 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.790
 then add a tablespoon of vinegar 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.290
 add a tablespoon of vinegar 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.470
 then we close the jar and wave it 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.990
 so that the mixture is well 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.990
 of the two products 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.600
 after 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.759
 then we uncover the container 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.240
 we use the filter in the following 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.659
 container then we pour a part of 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 the mixture 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.480
 we realize that this process takes 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.330
 a little time 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.320
 because you already want and are forming 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.320
 the one who is 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 the vinegar 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.190
 and the vinegar so acetic acid contains 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.560
 loose atoms of hydrogen the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.370
 Milk casin molecules are 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 they mix with the loose atoms of 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.110
 hydrogen that contains the acid and it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 produces a chemical reaction 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.620
 now the next step 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.140
 is to pour 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.480
 check that the mixture is well 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.519
 done for this 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.519
 let's try the same 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.140
 already the mixture has a texture like 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.930
 the taste of cheese now we give ourselves 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.850
 account that casein is a molecule 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.670
 that is found in milk molecules 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.290
 and the atoms are tiny minis 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.900
 particles that form everything that we 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.060
 surrounds 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.140
 the castilla molecule contained in the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.980
 fact of having a negative charge 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.930
 while the atoms 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.340
 while the salaries atoms of the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.159
 hydrogen that in the acid has a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.489
 positive charge the algae a point 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.099
 Central between molecules of casein and 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.660
 the loose atoms of hydrogen are 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:16.470
 group and form as visible clots 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.620
 those clots are called clots and they 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 used to make the cheese 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.519
 the liquid is called serum are usually 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.250
 add bacteria 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.629
 so that that we have more flavor 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.700
 we realize that the mixture is 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.630
 putting something frothy 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.550
 after two hours 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.550
 This is the result of the experiment
