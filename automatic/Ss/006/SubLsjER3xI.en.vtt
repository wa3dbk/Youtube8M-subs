00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:07.378
 Gentlemen, tell this secret to someone and you will be investigated. 

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:18.025
 His name is John Mason ... 

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:22.413
 ... a British citizen who has been imprisoned in Alcatraz since 1962. 

00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.617
 He escaped in 1963. 

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:30.689
 He has no identity in the US or Britain. Nor does it exist. 

00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.338
 Secrets have a way to go back to the surface and squeeze you there. 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.751
 The hostages are imprisoned at Alcatraz. 

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.236
 - Hostage? - 81 tourists. 

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.403
 Rock is a tourist attraction? 

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:47.931
 Those who were trained to protect you ... 

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:49.349
 ... become the greatest threat. 

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:55.991
 VX Gas rockets are ready to destroy all of San Francisco and adjacent areas. 

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:59.653
 The ones you abandoned become your only hope. 

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:01.561
 - You go talk to him. - Me? 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.169
 Yeah. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.490
 Hi. I'm an FF-FBI agent. 

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:07.988
 I'm Stanley Goodspeed. 

00:01:08.132 --> 00:01:09.583
 Of course you are. 

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:11.295
 He told him the real name, didn't he? 

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.722
 Right now, everything between the city and the disaster ... 

00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:19.517
 You can't imagine what would happen after launching that gas. 

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:21.013
 That's why you go with us. 

00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:23.434
 ... is a man who has never been in a fight ... 

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:27.869
 - You're a chemical monster. - I'm a chemical supernetvor, actually. 

00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.044
 ... and the other man who hasn't been in action for thirty years. 

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:34.121
 - Show us the way on the map. - I can not. 

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:36.642
 The plan was in my head. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.466
 Fortunately, something can't be forgotten. 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.975
 But don't worry, I'll remember. 

00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:52.046
 From Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer ... 

00:01:52.092 --> 00:01:54.606
 ... producers of Top Gun and Crimson Tidu ... 

00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.652
 ... and Michael Bay, director of Mizerové. 

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:01.637
 Welcome to Rock. 

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:04.033
 We have visitors. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.192
 Sean Connery 

00:02:05.337 --> 00:02:07.717
 - You are ready? - I'll do what I can. 

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:13.349
 What can you do? Only the apostates do what they can. 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.345
 Yes. 

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:15.430
 Nicolas Cage 

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:19.935
 I'm just a biochemist, I'm here to destroy the missiles. 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.989
 So show me some action! 

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:23.689
 Ed Harris 

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:24.650
 Shoot. 

00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:54.065
 Get ready for the Rock. 

00:02:56.214 --> 00:02:58.088
