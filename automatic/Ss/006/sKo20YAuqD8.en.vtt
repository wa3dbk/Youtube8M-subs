 Probably all football fans in Wroclaw and Poland know who you are, but for those who do not know. Tell us about your history in football in the USA and in Europe. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 First and foremost, football is actually the only sport that I've grown. I started playing when I was 4 years old, I played in elementary and middle school. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 I was able to get a scholarship at the Northwestern University, where I was a basic player for three years. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I participated in several NFL tests, but I could not, so I decided to start playing in Europe. I played in Finland and then in Germany 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 My team mate Mark Philmore told me about Wroclaw, so I decided to come here. I was also in Brazil, teaching football around the world. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 We can safely say that you are a football globetrotter, but you have decided to stay in Wroclaw, which is somewhat your second home. Where does the decision to live and play here come from? 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Here I feel like in a family, I know a city, I know people, also outside of football. I know more people here than in the city I come from and feel at home. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 It's a great combination, and I always insist that if something is not broken, do not fix it, so I'm here again. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:49.000
 You are the first player who officially signed a contract with the new Panthers Wroclaw team. As we know, this is a huge project combining Devils Wroclaw and Giants Wroclaw. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Is this a challenge for you and what do you think about joining these clubs? 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 I think it is a great idea and a great opportunity for Poland to play abroad. These two teams have always been among the strongest in this country. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.700
 I fought against these players for three years. Now being able to stand with them on one side and fight for a common goal is a great opportunity. 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:29.400
 Football in Poland is growing all the time. What, in your opinion, should be the next steps to make it even more popular in our country? 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.400
 First of all, talk about it to people. We take the right steps to develop discipline, now we have to show it to people. 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 I often meet people who are surprised that football is playing in Poland, but they show interest. If we give them contact with our sport, they will finally come to matches. 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:05.400
 If you were to advise someone what to do while in Wroclaw, you would definitely invite to the Panthers match, but what else should he see and where to go while in Wroclaw. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.700
 The place you must see when coming to Wroclaw is definitely the Market Square. 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 All my friends who come to visit from the States say that at first they were afraid of going to Poland, but when they see the Market they say, "wow, this is a beautiful city". 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.300
 Personally, I think that this place should see everyone and when we continue to develop, more people will hear about it. 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 You've been in Poland for 3 years, do you remember the funny situations that happened to you? 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 We all know about the stereotypes and stories that revolve around Poland in the world. What were your most funny when you came? 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.300
 Being an African-American in Europe is, let's say, different. 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:07.300
 You always meet people who think you are a rapper or a basketball player because they do not know about football in Poland. 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:18.300
 Some ask for an autograph, not even knowing what I am doing. People show a lot of love and I'm grateful for that. 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.300
 Thanks for the interview. I hope it will be a very good season. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.300
 Thank you.
