headache trying to get it excuse me it's
just<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> headache<00:01:47.670> trying<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just a headache trying to get it to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.520 
just a headache trying to get it to
render<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.970> alpha<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
render out as an alpha that way so I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.550 
render out as an alpha that way so I
just<00:01:52.799> leave<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.070> full<00:01:53.369> render<00:01:55.130> output

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
just leave it on full render output

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
just leave it on full render output
these<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.799> settings<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.340> chose<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> into

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
these are settings that I chose so into

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.429 
these are settings that I chose so into
dpi<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.310> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.759> screen

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
dpi because it's going to be on screen

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.870 
dpi because it's going to be on screen
now<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:04.890> printing<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.759> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
now if you're printing it would be on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.070 
now if you're printing it would be on
300<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.680> can't<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.190> an<00:02:09.080> animated

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
300 but you can't have an animated

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.610 
300 but you can't have an animated
object<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> piece<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> paper

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
object on a piece of paper

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.210 
object on a piece of paper
so<00:02:12.980> we're<00:02:13.220> leaving<00:02:13.310> at<00:02:13.550> 72<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.040> sake<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so we're leaving at 72 for the sake of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.979 
so we're leaving at 72 for the sake of
this<00:02:16.370> tutorial<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:17.330> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.599> just<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.900> to

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
this tutorial I'm going to just going to

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.610 
this tutorial I'm going to just going to
leave<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.110> out<00:02:18.260> 45<00:02:18.680> frames<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.200> default

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
leave it out 45 frames which the default

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.940 
leave it out 45 frames which the default
is<00:02:21.890> 90<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.269> we<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:24.349> don't<00:02:24.440> need<00:02:24.620> all<00:02:24.680> those

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
is 90 but we really don't need all those

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.900 
is 90 but we really don't need all those
frames<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.519> something<00:02:25.819> as<00:02:25.910> simple<00:02:26.090> as<00:02:26.269> this

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
frames for something as simple as this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.259

now<00:02:55.760> as<00:02:55.880> we're<00:02:56.090> here<00:02:56.530> typically<00:02:57.530> this<00:02:57.709> is

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
now as we're here typically this is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.979 
now as we're here typically this is
unchecked<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.700> all<00:02:58.849> you<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.150> do<00:02:59.299> is<00:02:59.629> just

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
unchecked but all you have to do is just

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.759 
unchecked but all you have to do is just
check<00:03:00.379> alpha<00:03:00.799> channel<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:03.500> pretty<00:03:03.680> much

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
check alpha channel and that pretty much

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.289 
check alpha channel and that pretty much
does<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.220> for<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.849> don't<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.180> mess

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
does it for that you don't have to mess

add effects to it but we're not going to

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.289 
add effects to it but we're not going to
cover<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.299> in<00:03:26.359> this<00:03:26.600> tutorial<00:03:27.079> today

just<00:03:43.800> for<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.069> tutorial<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:45.480> things<00:03:45.810> will

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
just for the tutorial that things will

00:03:46.019 --> 00:04:00.390 
just for the tutorial that things will
work<00:03:46.170> out<00:03:46.379> that<00:03:46.650> way<00:03:47.180> yes

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.700 

rendering<00:04:01.400> ticks<00:04:02.210> forever<00:04:02.660> but<00:04:03.080> this<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.560> what

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
rendering ticks forever but this is what

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.180 
rendering ticks forever but this is what
we<00:04:03.830> do<00:04:04.070> because<00:04:04.430> we're<00:04:04.700> 3d<00:04:05.120> animators<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:06.470> we

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
we do because we're 3d animators and we

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.860 
we do because we're 3d animators and we
just<00:04:07.400> absolutely<00:04:07.700> love<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.450> world<00:04:08.690> of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
just absolutely love the world of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.720 
just absolutely love the world of
rendering<00:04:09.400> high-five

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
rendering high-five

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:29.340

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.440 

alright<00:05:11.600> rendering<00:05:12.170> is<00:05:12.380> done<00:05:12.940> just<00:05:13.940> minimize

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
alright rendering is done just minimize

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.650 
alright rendering is done just minimize
that<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.140> we'll<00:05:15.800> minimize<00:05:16.130> that<00:05:16.580> oh<00:05:16.850> my<00:05:17.330> god

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
all right so this is where well this is

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.750 
all right so this is where well this is
the<00:05:24.200> file<00:05:24.410> that<00:05:24.680> we<00:05:24.860> exported<00:05:24.890> out<00:05:25.700> break5<00:05:26.570> MOV

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
the file that we exported out break5 MOV

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.230 
the file that we exported out break5 MOV
just<00:05:28.760> going<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.060> drag<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.540> and<00:05:30.880> bring<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.060> right

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
just going to drag it and bring it right

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.400 
just going to drag it and bring it right
on<00:05:32.510> in<00:05:32.690> here

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410

now<00:05:34.220> I<00:05:34.250> already<00:05:34.520> brought<00:05:34.670> it<00:05:34.850> in<00:05:34.940> here<00:05:34.970> just<00:05:35.660> to

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
now I already brought it in here just to

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.520 
now I already brought it in here just to
test<00:05:36.020> things<00:05:36.260> out<00:05:36.440> before<00:05:36.650> I<00:05:36.890> start<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.550> film

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
test things out before I start the film

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.070 
test things out before I start the film
but<00:05:40.060> just<00:05:41.060> that<00:05:41.240> way<00:05:41.330> y'all<00:05:41.570> could<00:05:41.750> see<00:05:41.930> what

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
but just that way y'all could see what

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.710 
but just that way y'all could see what
I'm<00:05:42.170> doing<00:05:42.530> here<00:05:43.480> yeah<00:05:45.460> all<00:05:46.460> right<00:05:46.670> so<00:05:46.880> we<00:05:47.450> drag
