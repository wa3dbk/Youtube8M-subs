00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello to king and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.020
 I mention the decisions 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.020
 pro evolution soccer 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.960
 otherwise they could have too many 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.960
 problems at the time 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.169
 porsche ps and I saw it 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.220
 in the game where he has 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.940
 2013 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.530
 they have it or in any direction 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.060
 of the route 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 it does not matter they have to put it where 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.330
 your 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330
 and they do not have it 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.759
 and it is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.759
 now I have it installed 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990
 run 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.950
 install it inside the folder that is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.950
 he creates them inside him 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.510
 they will have to be crazy inside 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 in the game they created this folder and 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.050
 they have what 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.730
 that pretty 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.610
 if you will not miss some mistakes 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.010
 incredible 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.200
 and the third one try not to change 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.420
 matter where they have the game this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.530
 it always goes the same 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.170
 have the game installed on it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 of o ene efe always leave you and I'll 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.670
 put 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.380
 with that I would have to run the game 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.380
 now after the last of what 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.069
 the allocations of the stadiums 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.819
 of light 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.030
 of the Brazilian who had forgotten 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 shorter 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
 already with that I would have to have everything 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.720
 correctly installed any 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.090

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.120
