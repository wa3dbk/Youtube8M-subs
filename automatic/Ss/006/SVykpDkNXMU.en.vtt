00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.710
 hi youtube my phone went off 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.750
 on the previous video because I have 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.030
 received a message sea ​​is a lot and 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 who will send this message 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.299
 So I'm just going to recap 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.530
 all the ultras that I had this 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.700
 week I saw that there was more than 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.780
 that in the impression of a video so 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.070
 it's a party so the art crowd frame 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.690
 so to his little story for those who 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.790
 have followed the video from before is there this is 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.690
 really a director this map because 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.710
 that I really had too much luck 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:42.150
 what ent scarf like that a finished word 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:51.410
 with obscure explorers tel so I have 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:51.410
 in two times everything is french giratina 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:08.400
 the best I think it's me 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:10.710
 personally the watsa rake and that I 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.200
 find it's the ugliest it's 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.500
 maybe because of its promo version 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 therefore the three times thereafter at the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.509

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:38.240
