see my tip on how to connect to a Mac
then<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> printer<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.189> upload<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> canon

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
then to a printer to upload to the canon

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.200 
then to a printer to upload to the canon
gateway<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> finally<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> DLNA<00:01:23.520> server<00:01:23.939> so

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
gateway and finally to a DLNA server so

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.020 
gateway and finally to a DLNA server so
you<00:01:24.270> could<00:01:24.540> actually<00:01:24.930> show<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> TV<00:01:26.030> we're

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you could actually show it on a TV we're

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
you could actually show it on a TV we're
going<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> iPhone<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
going to go with the iPhone so it's the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
going to go with the iPhone so it's the
second<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> top<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:32.090> here<00:01:33.090> let's<00:01:33.570> use

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
second one on the top and here let's use

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
second one on the top and here let's use
the<00:01:33.930> easy<00:01:34.049> connection<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.729> connection

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the easy connection and the connection

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.120 
the easy connection and the connection
point<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.259> you'll<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.009> have

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
point so you'll see that you will have

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
point so you'll see that you will have
an<00:01:38.250> SSID<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> name<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> Wi-Fi

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
an SSID which is the name of the Wi-Fi

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.440 
an SSID which is the name of the Wi-Fi
network<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.560> an<00:01:40.920> encryption<00:01:41.250> key<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
network and an encryption key on the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
network and an encryption key on the
iPhone<00:01:42.869> go<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.799> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.430> settings<00:01:44.850> Wi-Fi

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
iPhone go up to Wi-Fi so settings Wi-Fi

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.109 
iPhone go up to Wi-Fi so settings Wi-Fi
and<00:01:45.560> you'll<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.189> new<00:01:47.460> network<00:01:47.820> will

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and you'll see that a new network will
