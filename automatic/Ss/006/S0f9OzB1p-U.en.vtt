00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 currently probably the best goalkeeper in the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.609
 dkb handball bundesliga turns the tables 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.040
 same time 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.650
 actually, the day starts with matthias 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 be different but sluggish the point games 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 evening succeeded now had first one 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.020
 crate ago 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 It could not be any better for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 the flensburger the seven years at 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.800
 ore rival and class kiel 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 played side by side with world champion 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 henning fritz 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.240
 I think you do not have to compare 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.310
 but only we are happy about that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 Now I'm just happy if it's good 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.660
 I work a lot for it and I work 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.940
 of course wants to continue like this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.809
 Anderson's world class she does not come from 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.030
 approximately 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.219
 the Swede has precise procedures for himself 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 he is obsessed with detail 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.110
 every 40 to 60 cubes per game 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.750
 his goal was fired after that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 still stored in the head just like the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.680
 Analyzes of the litter preferences of 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.940
 opponent always got ready 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760
 that's so meticulous before 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
 watched many games in the hall each 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.149
 times is before every game 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.059
 several hours of video studies in the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.049
 own four walls on the agenda 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.979
 I noticed that I was fine 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.210
 I do that too, I always want that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.740
 I always do the same 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.439
 same vorbereich and whether that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 now the cup final against thw kiel is 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.460
 or if that is somehow cup play 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.450
 maybe second third is going then 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 I always do the same preparation 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 I realize that I good away 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 have found a fresh estimate 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 how many do I react after the video 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.939
 how many balls play happens with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.740
 defensive and so on and I have 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.720
 just found a way how very good 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 fits differently from probably stands on the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 zenit of his career in his mid-thirties 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 pay in his opinion 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.329
 experience and rest in the game from he 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 records the most parades by far 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.320
 All goalkeepers in the strongest league of the 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.880
 world its services are with 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 decisive for the flensburg game 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 which is traditionally characterized by 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 being different has a lot of fun with it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 the sg troupe modestly emphasizes this 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 Good interaction with the defense and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.680
 enjoys a basic trust of trainer 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 ljubomir vranjes but what proportion 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.399
 his form has the video now 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.140
 I really have that in the study 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.970
 that maybe not so 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.069
 many call each other in the game 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.030
 but maybe someday and that will come 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.250
 I saw that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.319
 or so and therefore is always difficult 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.290
 how much preparation how to compare 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.390
 a lot is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.079
 mentally how much I physically how much 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.769
 is gameplay that is difficult 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.750
 estimate 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.069
 The keeper must change the tire too 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.010
 this is part of everyday life 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.870
 in addition to the 50 to 60 days in the year 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.150
 as a player of the sg flensburg 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.620
 Handewitt alone in the bus spends beside 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.709
 the duties every third day 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.819
 in addition to the many workouts 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.400
 this is the twofold family man 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.620
 the support of his family certainly 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.200
 and the time together with wife and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.639
 children are holy though sometimes they are 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.599
 not so easy to fall by the hand 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.250
 let go 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.569
 Of course I will try 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.510
 turned off something completely different 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.659
 play with the children with the children 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.129
 maybe just walking in the woods 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.769
 the person driver or to make 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.900
 something just that you do not always think 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.430
 and meanwhile that is so 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.629
 children between parents understand it yes 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.230
 even a little bit now does that 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.090
 also fun with the handball and then it is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.400
 It's also a thing you have such a thing 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.349
 bit together and now that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.980
 moment slowly enjoy yourself to rest 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.439
 put 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.449
 because of the hot-blooded flensburgers 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.000
 fans tear the sg team with and 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.400
 conversely , exactly this is what happens 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.709
 Emotions also keep up the tension 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.840
 in the dense everyday life of a professional handball 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.060
 and he wants to go higher 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.540
 I always want more , of course, too 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.799
 so i have a claim on that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.930
 Workroom has been there who stops 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.790
 getting better stops being good 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.970
 and therefore you always have to 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.840
 you always have to watch what 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.419
 you can improve 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.889
 Well that can be what the opponents are 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.870
 So maybe soon 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:57.370
 more afraid of the swedish swer 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.370
 in the flensburg box
