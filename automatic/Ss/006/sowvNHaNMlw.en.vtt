00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 that I was not in my precedent 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 you have requested in many is a 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 super easy make-up not easy 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
 this is needed to make them give up right away 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.640
 few belinelli products are made 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 all things with the hypo value in other words 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.490
 so many kitty that are great for 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 maybe a trick of the day tele 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.070
 realize I hope you like it and for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 who wants to know how I made it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 followed the video 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's do something we have to prepare 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 at the base for the make-up so let's put it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.890
 the brand air use this here asks 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.870
 the cat risse always used in the arc 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.629
 and maybe in the last 45 days it is me 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 We loved by a good quality 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.550
 at the beginning it was a little more than 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.750
 now it remains slightly harder though 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 really morning the trick from that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
 day has nothing to envy to ugo 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
 bold that to say is really good 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.270
 I am amazed by the quality and taste more or 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 minus 3 euros and 99 and then I want to give 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 quickly light points without 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.730
 use no brush I can do 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 thanks to a creamy product and serves a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 creamy product but not too much 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.860
 too much due because if you like it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.840
 treats let's say a lot of makeup together 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 day so it is not a thing that remains 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.970
 quite sober I am going to use the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.330
 beautiful maxi call penfold 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 bersani is a kiss and with reflections e 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
 slightly caramel and very much 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.500
 cute with his finger I go to apply 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 directly into the internal rhyme in the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 part of the inner right angle so 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.930
 I always lose that finger and then I go 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.640
 to do all the makeup are 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.480
 that enemy color as we have said 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.750
 immediately that would be 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.450
 tobacco from the latest snow collection 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.100
 cosmetics is a color that I already have 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.260
 put in eye shadow favorites 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.590
 see with suite if I want to make you 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.420
 see the application all over the eye 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.480
 we say to use it for the whole 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.760
 those trick I'm going to pick up 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.410
 basically with two brushes I want 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.630
 use for this trick two types of 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.090
 penn of 1 small app we have one 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.030
 slightly larger to fade 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 this little pen and is part of the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.630
 series pros pros of the pope and gods 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.000
 small ones are beginning with the rhyme 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.500
 lower takes a little bit that color and 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.750
 I'm going to apply it from the end 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.740
 of the eye poured much internal bile 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.110
 very quickly 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.980
 being a satin color of course 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.500
 not too opaque as it applies e 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.060
 it also fades practically on its own then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.230
 I'm going to pick up a little bit of color 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.910
 with this brush and that is the brush 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 of snow cosmetics of noises o 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.020
 blending and where I go the hinge in 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.580
 I sell on everything but adding the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.640
 slightly around 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.800
 I always start from the outside 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.820
 I want there to be more of the dying one in 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.020
 absolute that could be inside 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.410
 always doing gods continuously 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.580
 rotary movements on itself without 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:05.330
 looking at me too much is enough 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.980
 stuck in my eyelid and go 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.989
 just to evenly distribute the 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.550
 color if I want to add more 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.620
 I always start from the part anyway 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.030
 external that would be the darkest one in 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.030
 way to matches 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.049
 and some of the leftovers that remain on 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.739
 brush are not all around 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.420
 on the hard fixed stage then I go to make 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.620
 review eyeliner and as of one 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.459
 morning I don't want too much 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.560
 get tired with the use of 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.120
 etc. I'm going to get a pencil 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.650
 very soft that those funds already come from 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.720
 then liner must be very much of 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.849
 existing for example I'm talking about 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.099
 this gives the may pawns that are part of it 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.349
 from the series to bastard drama and it is one 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.620
 blue metallic pencil this is the 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.620
 number 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.579
 this is the pencil of the mib that yes 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.489
 me part of the master drama series 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.609
 which is called brook electric blue 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.939
 horizon and first beautiful champion 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.040
 used 13 really gorgeous e 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.359
 very soft and while still soft 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.280
 we must try to extract the teeth if 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.049
 I fear the eyelid touching the car 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.519
 fixed with his wife must be careful 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.010
 this thing and therefore expect to 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.769
 session man but crisis sos track and not yes 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.680
 it can no longer just another part then then 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.020
 to apply it I start from the outside 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.099
 and I make a line that goes towards 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.050
 the outside and then I move around instead 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.050
 to the eye to create a continuous line 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.469
 now parents and the complete that 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.299
 makes ours even easier 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.009
 application of the venier 

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:47.889
 if I take a very small brush 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:50.129
 flat I can help pull it up there 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.209
 the tip is still soft 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.919
 of union liar and make it 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:56.110
 consequently very very thin 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.579
 because that morning and let's say three golds 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.289
 temper it at all times 

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:01.269
 I want to tip 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.469
 or I would still be very large 

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:04.089
 instead with the help of a small brush 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.459
 I can pull the line even to 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.739
 infinite doing really thin and 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:10.719
 stretching it without going to 

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:13.269
 add over color without making it 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.249
 own dignitary almost truncate 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:18.459
 side so I can't avoid in 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.989
 this way here to recreate the tehran 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:22.419
 hills that I am going to say my share 

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:26.709
 outside inside and with the beautiful the 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:30.610
 brush can help me back to 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:32.019
 create a very very thin tip 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.999
 then this a few times to apply 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.679
 the mascara as I have shown to 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:40.269
 optimize this guide the essence that 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:44.319
 it's called large with wild mascara 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:46.499
 of the last we say the juve also in the 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.499
 collection 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.570
 for the rest of the face first thing 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.120
 I want to use a little bit of earth 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.610
 opaque for this is that of the pupa that 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:03.090
 it's called forcing powder the name 0 0 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:06.389
 to apply a small brush of physics 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:10.050
 but I take a plus rush a little bit e 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:15.660
 founds and I go to give a little bit of 13 for 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:29.070
 face and then like blush use this 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:30.960
 here of number 104 so then I'm going to do 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.220

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.169

 I really like them so much 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:17.280
 I'm not going to experiment eating with a 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.870
 object so tasty with a color that 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.610
 remains portable including one that can 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.919
 always wear very durable 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:30.970
 great fun at a very long finish 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:33.370
 very thick creamy and lasts throughout 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.539

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:38.680
 simple because anyone would be capable 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.590
 to make it happen I hope you found it 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.750
