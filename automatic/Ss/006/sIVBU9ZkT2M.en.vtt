00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.810
 everyone tells me magazine for the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.010
 Today's video review we present to you 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:22.140
 the pa has a real hd design 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.030
 software because up and it would be a little bit 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.130
 belittle this fantastic this 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.310
 fantastic software is a real one 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.520
 software to create project schemes in 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.530
 3d of the housing naturally like 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.150
 see the are also present 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.180
 directly all those that are 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.480
 measures therefore useful for example to a 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.540
 architect or surveyor but also to one 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.130
 person not involved in the work for 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.950
 redesign your home or 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.989
 of course change it you can see 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.360
 also insert objects 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.100
 the application is all in Italian as 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.309
 said it is in 3d 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.200
 we will have already established projects 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.829
 andiamoli to see as you see here there 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.020
 they will be 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.340
 there are different then of course 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.920
 we can define all the variables and 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 we will be able to create chlorine in ours 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.500
 apartment is however to change to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.280
 this depending on our 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.190
 needs 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 now for example let's go to see one 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.549
 to giava structure made of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.700
 volunteers that we realize the di 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:34.180
 what is this application 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 we can perhaps raise the walls, that is the ci 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.880
 all the measurements are present in 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.820
 centimeters and in square meters 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.479
 then naturally we have the plant 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.689
 we can take it from an image that 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.540
 we have redesigned or 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.259
 naturally start the project from 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 head 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.610
 let's go immediately to see what then 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.520
 the case layout we can do 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.210
 zoom in we can change those that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.690
 just for example le 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 the various objects present within 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.760
 home in a very, very way 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.240
 professional who has among all the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.790
 software that up until now or video 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.640
 reviewed for this 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.500
 kind of professionalism within 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 an app 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 I rarely found it for how long 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.819
 regards this type of application is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.340
 really really well done definitely 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:36.150
 useful for professionals as you can see 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.450
 we can of course carry out the 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.350
 various changes also in 3d for example 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.380
 change the color of the wall or move 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.940
 an object type 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.840
 now I make a change for example 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.850
 I also change the other one to the wall 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:03.380
 wall and then of course we can turn 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.739
 inside the building 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.690
 so let's come back dear because with 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.019
 the commands on the left go forward e 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.049
 behind and we turn to the right and series and then 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.459
 of course with the other flow I love you 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.400
 so we can have the view of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.950
 the whole apartment 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.489
 naturally in 3d later we have the various ones 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.549
 visuals we can return to tv for 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.790
 see the plant directly back 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.120
 of course to 3d or go to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.239
 modify our project 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.239
 for example we take a window 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:52.410
 you see it's really really good 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:55.799
 very technical application and for this 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.870
 the employees are very suitable 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.320
 as you can see I can increase and decrease 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.380
 those that are thicknesses 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.430
 of course I can change move 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.430
 the armchair 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.150
 I can also naturally move those 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:17.269
 which are the doors are a real one 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.040
 naturally useful, imagine me 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.259
 I address above all to the employees to the 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.139
 work while I'm around for example 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.860
 surveyor architects who have to 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.979
 however show the customer immediately one 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.100
 visual of what their home will look like 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.100
 for example after a renovation 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.310
 we could have myriad myriad 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.919
 of of objects and however all the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.389
 measurements are as you saw in 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.610
 square meters 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.669
 sometimes the centimeters are shown 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.410
 maybe projects do not fall so 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.229
 because the means are expressed anyway 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.350
 what other functionality of course 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.470
 we have an already established series of e 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.020
 those that are furniture are also 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.650
 divided by the living room kitchen 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.090
 bedroom bathroom and also for how much 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.520
 regards the outsiders currently 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.380
 developers was nothing at all 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.800
 case because we can of course 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.490
 insert some of the furniture for 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 garden 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.780
 of course as you see these are 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.919
 blocked if it does not shorten and then 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.300
 they must be purchased up to the bathroom 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:38.990
 you will have a wide choice of possibilities 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.180
 of barrel furniture and all the others because 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.120
 there are many but many of the application 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.610
 it's really very well done 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.639
 another thing if we want to see ad 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.870
 example creating a new project will be 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.599
 very simple 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.599
 naturally we report what is the 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.510
 our project 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:02.150
 we set what is the square footage 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.159
 currently it is not reported because 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.659
 this is a type of mold for example 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:11.240
 first to give up right away is a type of calculation 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.720
 which is carried out based on the whole 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.150
 square footage the compass helps us to understand 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.120
 also the direction can be 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.670
 naturally useful to know where 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.340
 beat the salt then to fix 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.620
 the positions of the mountain windows that 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.410
 you consume less energy you take advantage of a lot 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.330
 more sunlight 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:40.090
 what I wanted you to see ad 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:42.470
 example for example we insert for 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.170
 absolute two windows 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:50.690
 in this way of course we can then 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:54.260
 see the visual of ours 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.560
 apartment is an apology application 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.240
 if I repeat it but it really is 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.340
 very interesting but very interesting 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.020
 as you can see all the furniture can be 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:09.950
 changed we could color the walls and it is 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:12.860
 an application definitely not to be done 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:16.750
 run away especially reiterate for 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:19.670
 regarding the insiders 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.260
 but guys for this video review 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.080
 everything was a pleasure to review 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.930
 an app just better with 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:31.970
 software really really well done and it is 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:34.880
 an application that you can use a 

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.770
 360 that for this video review everything 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.100
 but see you at the next hello a 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.100
 all
