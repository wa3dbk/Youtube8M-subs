00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so we here shenzhen flying technology

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.660 
so we here shenzhen flying technology
here<00:00:02.639> with<00:00:02.820> smile<00:00:03.560> night<00:00:04.560> my<00:00:04.859> name<00:00:05.100> your<00:00:05.609> name

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
here with smile night my name your name

here with smile night my name your name
yes<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.830> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.069> cortex<00:00:08.610> a9<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.330> says

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
yes and this is a cortex a9 it says

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.039 
yes and this is a cortex a9 it says
cortex<00:00:10.019> a9<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.679> coming<00:00:11.040> cortex<00:00:11.820> yet<00:00:12.090> i<00:00:12.360> thought

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
cortex a9 is coming cortex yet i thought

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.220 
cortex a9 is coming cortex yet i thought
it<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.290> too<00:00:13.469> nigga<00:00:13.620> ain't<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.190> yes<00:00:15.059> yes<00:00:15.690> so

this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.680> logic<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.730> yet<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.340> how

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this is I'm logic I'm not yet so how

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
this is I'm logic I'm not yet so how
hard<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> make<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.949> was<00:00:23.100> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
hard was it to make this it was a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
hard was it to make this it was a
difficult<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.730> make<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.210> work<00:00:24.560> do<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.619> have

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
difficult to make it work do you have

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.160 
difficult to make it work do you have
engineers<00:00:26.250> UCB<00:00:26.820> provider<00:00:27.779> yes<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
engineers UCB provider yes we have the

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.740 
engineers UCB provider yes we have the
engineer<00:00:31.170> our<00:00:32.120> Rd<00:00:33.120> Rd<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> PCB<00:00:36.270> maker

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
engineer our Rd Rd you have a PCB maker

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:48.310 
engineer our Rd Rd you have a PCB maker
keep<00:00:37.230> partying

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.780 

yes<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.020> how<00:00:52.320> heavy<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.310> not<00:00:53.610> very

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
yes and so how heavy is this not very

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.780 
yes and so how heavy is this not very
heavy<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.239> thin<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.380> hdmi<00:00:55.920> output<00:00:56.400> or<00:00:56.640> all

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
heavy very thin it's hdmi output or all

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.340 
heavy very thin it's hdmi output or all
the<00:00:56.910> features<00:00:57.060> are<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.720> is<00:00:57.840> resistive

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the features are there this is resistive

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
the features are there this is resistive
a<00:00:58.559> Danish<00:00:59.190> yes<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.150> do<00:01:00.239> capacity

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
a Danish yes and you can do capacity

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:11.850 
a Danish yes and you can do capacity
also<00:01:00.960> yes<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.220> how<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.460> will<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.790> cost

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.590 

because<00:01:12.860> then<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:13.760> newest<00:01:14.210> android
