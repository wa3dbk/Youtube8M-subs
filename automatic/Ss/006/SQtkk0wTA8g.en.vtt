00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.089
 hi girls 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.760
 what's in my bag but in edition 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.219
 summer come with me to the pool 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.649
 I first the basic and essential is my 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.409
 towel and how could it be otherwise 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.980
 the pink girl and they bought me in dance 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.980
 stories 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.460
 This we have seen many times is 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.400
 my beach bag and I bought it in 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.329
 premium every year puts in bags very 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.329
 very similar 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.430
 now we go with the essential products 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.680
 The first thing is sunscreen before 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.830
 go down to the pool I made my cream 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.110
 of factor 30 and I repeat every time that I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 bathroom is to say when I'm wet I 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 came up a bit I go back to apply the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.299
 cream 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.789
 and like I protect my skin too 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.610
 He tried to protect my hair and that's why he uses 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.070
 a capillary protector thus prevented this 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.460
 damage with the pool and the sleeve and that with 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.740
 the sun clears me the third cream and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.979
 for me the most important is that of the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.979
 face and that's why I use factor greater than 50 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.450
 this is because I do not want any spots on 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
 the skin or problems with the sun or anything 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.980
 so I prefer to use a cream with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.970
 greater protection to get me very dark 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.250
 Quick 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 and finally as I am pretty 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 blanquita de piel 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.520
 I need an extra help to be able to 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.580
 get very very dark in summer and for 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.070
 that I use a solar oil with protection and 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 I also take it from coconut because the smell 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.020
 love and how are not also the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.770
 products for after exposure 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.800
 to the sun 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.180
 I have two lip balm that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.710
 well this also I apply it sometimes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.560
 as I notice that they are dry while 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.050
 written manuel are of factor 20 and a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.620
 coconut butter that the truth is that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.480
 moisturizes very well and retains the tan 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.580
 Another essential is to bring the mobile and the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 helmets to be able to listen to music without 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.540
 annoy those who are next to us 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.579
 another thing that can not be missing in my 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.829
 bag is the water camera to make 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.829
 videos photos and have a great time 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.370
 and since everyone always carries 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.700
 Sunglasses something to my hair up 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:54.880
 and I'm going to get money and cards and a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.880
 comb to end the day perfectly 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.990
 and as I always tell you many times
