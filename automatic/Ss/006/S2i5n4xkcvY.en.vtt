into<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:36.770> connectors<00:02:37.690> then<00:02:38.690> along

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
into the right connectors then along

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.110 
into the right connectors then along
comes<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.530> cryogen<00:02:40.040> scheme<00:02:40.400> they<00:02:40.820> fill<00:02:41.090> up

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
comes the cryogen scheme they fill up

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.360 
comes the cryogen scheme they fill up
the<00:02:41.300> liquid<00:02:41.870> nitrogen<00:02:42.230> tanks<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:42.980> then<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
the liquid nitrogen tanks and then the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.240 
the liquid nitrogen tanks and then the
helium<00:02:43.820> tanks<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.710> science

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
helium tanks and then the science

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.620 
helium tanks and then the science
instrument<00:02:49.730> team<00:02:49.880> will<00:02:50.030> come<00:02:50.210> out<00:02:50.360> check

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
instrument team will come out check

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.390 
instrument team will come out check
their<00:02:50.810> instrument<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.500> calibration<00:02:52.070> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
their instrument for calibration and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.670 
their instrument for calibration and
optical<00:02:53.180> accuracy<00:02:53.540> trying<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.410> not<00:02:54.620> again<00:02:56.680> yep

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
optical accuracy trying to not again yep

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.670 
optical accuracy trying to not again yep
and<00:02:57.890> that's<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.570> okay<00:02:59.570> that's<00:02:59.930> good<00:03:00.140> okay

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
and that's that okay that's good okay

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.790 
and that's that okay that's good okay
