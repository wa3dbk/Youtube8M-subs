00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.370
 so really back for you and although in the 9 I have an informant here 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.470
 not only the new Abt 5 is presented No, I am also a whole 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.620
 exclusive party with 500 invited guests and also some celebrities and the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.960
 Let's just dare now 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.560
 When celebrities had really gathered some eventually there was 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.860
 also a corresponding different after eleven years brings Audi with the a5 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.800
 finally a real coupe on the market again 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.830
 On the roof of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the guests of the event could 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 take a first look at the new car 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.350
 but not only the train's attention was on Singer Seal 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.360
 one of the invited guests and of course he did not take the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.620
 To give visitors a taste of his new album system 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 there too 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.310
 in fact, the artist does not talk much about his private life though 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 This evening he makes an exception he bends and even something about that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.080
 Secret of a happy relationship though Iran never crossed the Baltic Sea 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.289
 but work all right as the euro-space continues to prove itself so 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.700
 the murder is her neighborhood 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.780
 to reach it every time I guided our relationship 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.150
 how come that they are so happy? 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.140
 and what is the key to it 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.090
 that's quite easy Look at a premiere Heidi that the top Berlin 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.190
 she is the leader as she is the first to come to the pyramid after that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.930
 children 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 and below, as at the foot of the pyramids, there I am 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.620
 if you always remember it 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.350
 then i think this can be the key to a happy DSM 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.699
 Erwin Maisch 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.469
 Feelings in the competition started the Lisbon Batista is the first time 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.909

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.999
 Hallenser turned out in the interview as a true Frankfurt scene connoisseur 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:26.080
 which of the 12th 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.340
 Unfortunately, they were around at the time when I was 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.720
 another two glued floodlights as you could park up here in the car 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.120
 but of course the atmosphere is great as well the whole thing around it 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 the environment the view of the skyline of Frankfurt and I can already 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.650
 imagine that here one or the other nice balmy summer evening 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.769
 spend 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.769
 Janina said Sasse narrowly she has fallen her Frankfurt 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:51.169
 I was already very fond of doing so in the Paulskirche in Frankfurt 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.329
 that even today 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.199
 Frankfurt was always scene for me 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.219
 "There was initially or always been a lawyer and the exciting process was 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.299
 if late so top percent Doyle in Brake that was so the whole 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.189
 big clubs percent at the time and even today 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.209
 a you know that in Frankfurt easy 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.819
 but who percent are many creative people and who cares naturally 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.869
 Again and again for exciting and percent poultry, of course, also one 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:16.789
 city 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 Kassen certain location top ten lists could go demolition 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:25.819
 that does not seem wrong or not this mix of Rahden's all-modern 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.050
 Possibilities 9 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.160
 and then always on the very traditional so the whole speaks 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.750
 Cider culture Sachsenhausen Swiss street name I believe that's it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.510
 what makes up the Scharmann Frankfurt but what I like Wacker is like that 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.969
 whole corner Hanauer street percent that children more who recognizable 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.119
 and I like that quite well and of course the whole percent Wikis 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.119
 Percent the session gives that is of course a reality for the summer 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:56.059
 as well as probably every year, at least in terms of location 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.769
 City unity 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.029
 it does not burn anything 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.999
 learn the nz 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.389
 the couple Barack and Michelle Obama 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:05.369
 van Toorn 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.369
 yet organization sensational meetings 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.599
 long Island 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.060
 because there usually names 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.340
 the kind of damages were 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.409
 responsible is a 2 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.620
 it should 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 Sollberger very nice 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.489
 These messages are very special 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.069
 So everything is the leader of the right side 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.069
 took 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.029
 I do not know how I should not stop now the new Audi a5 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.719
 or Kai Pflaumes weather does not seem to take any of the two home 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:39.210
 can 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.819
 but the realsatire case, the data from Monday to Friday at 21 45 clock
