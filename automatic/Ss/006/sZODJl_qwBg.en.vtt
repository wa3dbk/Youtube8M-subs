00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.549
 the technician of chivas carlos likes 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.650
 acknowledged that he will seek to shelter the new 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 reinforcement of guadalajara angel reyna and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 make a healthy environment for everyone inside 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.890
 from the herd dressing room this said the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.509
 technician in talk with part time me 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.039
 I believe that all people need a 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:31.020
 I treat a deal according to how we are 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.670
 be 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.790
 basically for me it is very important 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.630
 part of making a good group that's 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.500
 key 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.239
 one can deliver more or feel more if 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.830
 is really committed to the one 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.510
 is next that's what I'm looking for 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.360
 also from the schools that have 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.910
 touched directing there are many situations 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.960
 first this how I felt like enjoyed 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.730
 football 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.010
 some inconveniences that there may be 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.140
 had in some other institution that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.670
 I was willing to have the 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 chance to play again in a team 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 great many things we were 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.890
 talking and I think he 's aware of 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 its moments that again a team 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.330
 great opens the possibility of power 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.150
 to be able to come I have seen it well mature 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.540
 in that part I hope everyone and in the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.729
 time we are together 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.500
 we can adapt to each one and he 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.960
 precisely to join a team that 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.200
 it is very healthy that it is very good and that it is 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.409
 with the illusion of having a good 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.420
 I just told him that this has to 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.030
 focus on football and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.610
 and come to a place that will give the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.549
 chance again to be at the maximum 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.290
 level is what it is that I think that 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.880
 it corresponds he is aware of that 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.590
 situation 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 and of course he always wants to fight up 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.990
 angel is an unbalancing player and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.049
 that is why it is always intended by many 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.049
 institutions 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.189
 is a player who can create in the 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.200
 last area that is the area where it is most 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.239
 difficult to find spaces so 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.090
 surely it will not come very well what 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.110
 what one seeks is to deal with the very 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.430
 good forward that has the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.730
 institution try to fill it with 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.610
 chances of goal and that has before 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.160
 a previous work that is necessary 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.510
 have it established and we look for a bit 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 of that that part does not
