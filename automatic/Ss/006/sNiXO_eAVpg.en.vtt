today<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.090> Friday<00:00:12.480> March<00:00:13.080> 8th<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.650> there's

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
today is Friday March 8th and there's

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.099 
today is Friday March 8th and there's
just<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.670> little<00:00:14.910> bit<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.150> electricity<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
just a little bit of electricity in the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.740 
just a little bit of electricity in the
air<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.560> Jeff<00:00:16.859> shower<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.490> I'm<00:00:18.150> Rick<00:00:18.420> Lavigne

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
air I'm Jeff shower and I'm Rick Lavigne

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.510 
air I'm Jeff shower and I'm Rick Lavigne
I'm<00:00:19.050> assuming<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.920> electricity

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
I'm assuming that that electricity

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
I'm assuming that that electricity
starts<00:00:21.180> every<00:00:21.480> month<00:00:21.689> when<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> moon<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
starts every month when the moon is in

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.859 
starts every month when the moon is in
Aquarius<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> things<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.240> buzzing<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
Aquarius and things are buzzing and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.529 
Aquarius and things are buzzing and
today<00:00:25.050> they're<00:00:25.260> buzzing<00:00:25.439> even<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> little<00:00:26.130> more

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
today they're buzzing even a little more

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.700 
today they're buzzing even a little more
absolutely<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.750> moon<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.080> Aquarius<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
absolutely the moon in Aquarius is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.429 
absolutely the moon in Aquarius is
certainly<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.119> source<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.869> comment

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
certainly the the source of that comment

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.970 
certainly the the source of that comment
Aquarius<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.610> weird<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:34.230> called

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Aquarius is so weird that it's called

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
Aquarius is so weird that it's called
the<00:00:35.190> Water<00:00:35.460> Bearer<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.329> not<00:00:36.540> an

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the Water Bearer but it's not an

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
the Water Bearer but it's not an
emotional<00:00:37.290> water<00:00:37.620> sign<00:00:38.010> it's<00:00:38.309> an

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
emotional water sign it's an

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
emotional water sign it's an
intellectual<00:00:39.149> air<00:00:39.390> sign<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.739> represents

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
intellectual air sign and it represents

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.790 
intellectual air sign and it represents
a<00:00:41.460> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> crackling<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.960> making

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
a kind of crackling of making

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.950 
a kind of crackling of making
connections<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> mind<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> think

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
connections in the mind and I think

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.110 
connections in the mind and I think
that's<00:00:46.170> one<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> background<00:00:47.550> forces

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that's one of the background forces

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
that's one of the background forces
working<00:00:48.360> today<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
working today well and I think that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
working today well and I think that
today's<00:00:50.160> moon<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> Aquarius<00:00:51.420> does<00:00:51.690> hook<00:00:52.199> up

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
today's moon and Aquarius does hook up

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.650 
today's moon and Aquarius does hook up
with<00:00:52.649> several<00:00:52.949> outer<00:00:53.309> planets<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.539> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
with several outer planets I mean it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.910 
with several outer planets I mean it
forms<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:56.180> harmonious<00:00:57.199> sextile<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.469> Uranus

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
forms a harmonious sextile with Uranus

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
forms a harmonious sextile with Uranus
and<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> trine<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.760> Jupiter<00:01:00.329> Uranus<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and a trine with Jupiter Uranus and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
and a trine with Jupiter Uranus and
Jupiter<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.559> both<00:01:01.859> crackly<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.640> their<00:01:02.850> own

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
Jupiter are both crackly in their own

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
Jupiter are both crackly in their own
way<00:01:03.270> Uranus<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> probably<00:01:04.680> more<00:01:04.949> crackling

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
way Uranus is probably more crackling

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.520 
way Uranus is probably more crackling
because<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.880> related<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> lightning<00:01:06.960> but

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
because it's related to lightning but

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.420 
because it's related to lightning but
you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> Jupiter<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.700> also<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> storm<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you know Jupiter is also has a storm it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
you know Jupiter is also has a storm it
also<00:01:11.670> has<00:01:11.909> its<00:01:12.090> own<00:01:12.240> level<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.780> lightning<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
also has its own level of lightning and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.700 
also has its own level of lightning and
then<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> moon<00:01:14.760> forms<00:01:15.180> uh<00:01:15.360> maybe<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.439> little

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
then the moon forms uh maybe a little

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.640 
then the moon forms uh maybe a little
bit<00:01:16.890> more<00:01:17.040> restraining<00:01:17.729> square<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.780> Saturn

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
bit more restraining square with Saturn

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
bit more restraining square with Saturn
Saturn<00:01:20.189> holding<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> energy<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.200> i

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
Saturn holding the energy back but i

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
Saturn holding the energy back but i
think<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.530> there's<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> deeper<00:01:23.340> energy

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
think that there's a deeper energy

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.359 
think that there's a deeper energy
that's<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:25.049> restraining<00:01:25.920> us<00:01:26.100> all

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that's that's that's restraining us all

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
that's that's that's restraining us all
even<00:01:26.670> though<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> doesn't<00:01:27.180> stop<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
even though it doesn't stop the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
even though it doesn't stop the
crackling<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.829> lightning<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.460> surface

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
crackling the lightning on the surface

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
crackling the lightning on the surface
but<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.409> about<00:01:31.439> yeah

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
but it's not just all about yeah

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240 
but it's not just all about yeah
absolutely<00:01:32.270> today<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.900> second<00:01:34.829> 60

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
absolutely today is the second 60

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.130 
absolutely today is the second 60
degrees<00:01:35.579> sec<00:01:35.820> style<00:01:36.119> between<00:01:36.540> slow-moving

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
Saturn and Pluto not this necessarily

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
Saturn and Pluto not this necessarily
triggers<00:01:41.700> an<00:01:41.850> event<00:01:42.150> today<00:01:42.360> actually<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
triggers an event today actually the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
triggers an event today actually the
seriousness<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:45.000> dealing<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.600> your

insurance agent getting your will in

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.690 
insurance agent getting your will in
order<00:01:48.920> examining<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> would<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
order examining what you would do in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.450 
order examining what you would do in
case<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.119> had<00:01:51.240> bankruptcy<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.170> divorce<00:01:52.590> which

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
case you had bankruptcy or divorce which

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
case you had bankruptcy or divorce which
is<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.119> related<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.659> Pluto<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> ending

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is are all related to Pluto and ending

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
is are all related to Pluto and ending
yeah<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.170> preparing<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> worst<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.070> mean

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
yeah and preparing for the worst I mean

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.950 
yeah and preparing for the worst I mean
it<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.490> also<00:01:59.670> mean<00:02:00.240> setting<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.939> appropriate

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
it can also mean setting up appropriate

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
it can also mean setting up appropriate
protections<00:02:03.960> against<00:02:04.740> possible<00:02:05.310> losses<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
protections against possible losses and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.300 
protections against possible losses and
that's<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.180> big<00:02:06.329> background<00:02:06.869> theme<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:08.039> on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that's a big background theme going on

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
that's a big background theme going on
now<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.000> what's<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.390> interesting<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:10.140> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
now so what's really interesting is on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:10.930 
now so what's really interesting is on
one

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
one
