00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.630
 the stress really had a lot 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.010

 if you are not yet on facebook 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.289
 then you should definitely do it 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.640
 do not miss anything anymore though 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 that was not the topic in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 this video but as in the beginning 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.710
 said it's just about the bank robberies 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 because there are some new ones 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.309
 Information and indeed has the German 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 page gamereactor posted that from 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.950
 rockstar games germany the info 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.450
 should have received that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.430
 Bank robberies shortly after 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.200
 release of the next version in the game 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 Being inserted means we can not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 expect the bank robberies 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 right on 18.11 both extreme 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.910
 but are just a short time 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 I will be inserted later in the game 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.699
 of course, think that too 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 bank robberies then even with the old ones 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.080
 So generation at the ps3 and the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 xbox 360 also be included 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.049
 otherwise , of course, he has to be pretty 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.760
 asocial if the bank robberies only on 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 the next version come but that 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 I really can not imagine 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.710
 Of course you could say that now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210
 Of course that is just dark work 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.740
 think of the side of the game markets, however 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.090
 I'm not that a fake is there this 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.259
 page is really well known and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 I do not think that shit 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.840
 tell 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 And yes, I can not think of a case right 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.630
 Well imagine you can of course

 I just can feel good 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.579
 bank robberies now only with the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.560
