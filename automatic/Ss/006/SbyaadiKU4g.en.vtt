00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
probably one of our better performances

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.320 
probably one of our better performances
from<00:02:46.130> pre-season<00:02:46.760> in<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.000> obviously<00:02:47.239> our

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
from pre-season in the obviously our

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.300 
from pre-season in the obviously our
first<00:02:47.540> game<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.470> good<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.799> see<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.130> fax

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310

taking<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> bit<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.880> work<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.630> think<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.019> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
taking a bit of work on I think in the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.509 
taking a bit of work on I think in the
past<00:02:51.230> have<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.500> known<00:02:51.709> as<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.860> forward

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
past have you known as a forward

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920 
past have you known as a forward
dominant<00:02:53.000> team<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.420> hopefully<00:02:53.690> we'll<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.870> a

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
dominant team so hopefully we'll get a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.320 
dominant team so hopefully we'll get a
bit<00:02:54.080> more<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.350> balance<00:02:54.470> now<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.130> two<00:02:56.120> wins

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
bit more of a balance now and two wins

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.990 
bit more of a balance now and two wins

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
definitely the stronger side in for our

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.580 
definitely the stronger side in for our
departments<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.370> field<00:03:16.640> today

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
departments on the field today

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.710 
departments on the field today
defensively<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:20.190> struggled<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.640> set<00:03:20.820> piece<00:03:21.060> and

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
defensively we struggled a set piece and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.060 
defensively we struggled a set piece and
they<00:03:21.870> exploited<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.740> use<00:03:22.890> their

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
they exploited that they use their

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.950 
they exploited that they use their
weapons<00:03:23.400> well<00:03:23.580> there<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.060> thought<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
weapons well there I thought the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.720 
weapons well there I thought the
breakdown<00:03:25.440> area<00:03:25.770> we<00:03:25.920> competed<00:03:26.310> very<00:03:26.340> very

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
breakdown area we competed very very

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.580 
breakdown area we competed very very
well<00:03:26.910> than<00:03:27.210> our<00:03:27.330> defense<00:03:27.690> especially<00:03:28.320> around

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
well than our defense especially around

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.260 
well than our defense especially around
that<00:03:28.800> breakdown<00:03:29.160> area<00:03:29.430> was<00:03:29.520> very<00:03:29.760> strong<00:03:30.000> so

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
that breakdown area was very strong so

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.510 
that breakdown area was very strong so
I'm<00:03:30.480> pleased<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:30.990> on<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.740> whole<00:03:31.920> we

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
I'm pleased with that on the whole we

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.980 
I'm pleased with that on the whole we
need<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.730> develop<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.210> a<00:03:33.270> side<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> need<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> grow

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990
