00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
these apples make kind of interesting

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.889 
these apples make kind of interesting
stamps<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:08.009> and<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> dip<00:01:09.149> something<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
stamps now and when you dip something in

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.980 
stamps now and when you dip something in
you<00:01:10.380> tend<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.829> get<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.420> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> like

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
you tend to get a little bit of like

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
you tend to get a little bit of like
blobs<00:01:13.289> and<00:01:13.590> things<00:01:13.770> like<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:16.700> it's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
blobs and things like that on it so it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.279 
blobs and things like that on it so it's
a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:17.909> easier<00:01:18.299> sometimes<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.929> get<00:01:19.109> some

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
a little easier sometimes to get some

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.859 
a little easier sometimes to get some
kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.679> paint<00:01:20.280> brush<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> pouncer<00:01:21.689> like

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
kind of a paint brush or a pouncer like

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.149 
kind of a paint brush or a pouncer like
this<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.469> actually<00:01:23.250> load<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:24.649> stamp<00:01:25.649> with

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this and actually load your stamp with

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:36.370 
this and actually load your stamp with
that<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.469 

as<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.100> stamp<00:01:39.399> doesn't<00:01:40.399> look<00:01:40.490> exactly<00:01:40.969> like<00:01:41.210> an

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
as a stamp doesn't look exactly like an

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.149 
as a stamp doesn't look exactly like an
apple<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:42.259> wasn't<00:01:42.469> really<00:01:42.740> trying<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.009> make

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
apple but I wasn't really trying to make

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.200 
apple but I wasn't really trying to make
an<00:01:43.250> apple<00:01:43.579> it's<00:01:43.700> just<00:01:43.850> trying<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.090> do

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
an apple it's just trying to do

something<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:46.220> has<00:01:46.490> kind<00:01:46.729> of<00:01:46.759> a<00:01:46.880> uniform

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
something that has kind of a uniform

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.770 
something that has kind of a uniform
shape<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.320> stamp<00:01:48.590> now<00:01:49.479> one<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.630> ways

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
shape to the stamp now one of the ways

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.779 
shape to the stamp now one of the ways
that<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.079> can<00:01:51.259> make<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:51.740> stamp<00:01:52.130> for<00:01:52.369> yourself

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
that you can make a stamp for yourself

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.319 
that you can make a stamp for yourself
is<00:01:54.070> taking<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.159> wood<00:01:55.310> block<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:55.789> this<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
is taking a wood block like this and

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.910 
is taking a wood block like this and
then<00:01:57.970> using<00:01:58.970> these<00:01:59.090> little<00:01:59.470> craft<00:02:00.470> foamy

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
then using these little craft foamy

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.919 
then using these little craft foamy
things<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.819> can<00:02:01.970> just<00:02:02.119> glue<00:02:02.360> them<00:02:02.509> onto<00:02:02.720> the

things you can just glue them onto the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.109 
things you can just glue them onto the
block<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.470> any<00:02:03.679> kind<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.039> pattern<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:05.000> can

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
block and any kind of a pattern you can

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.700 
block and any kind of a pattern you can
use<00:02:05.179> shapes<00:02:05.659> are<00:02:05.869> already<00:02:06.110> cut<00:02:06.350> or<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.560> can

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
use shapes are already cut or you can

an<00:02:09.110> Elmer's<00:02:09.500> glue<00:02:09.920> or<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.160> tacky<00:02:10.459> glue<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.060> then

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
an Elmer's glue or a tacky glue and then

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.780 
an Elmer's glue or a tacky glue and then
when<00:02:12.140> it's<00:02:12.260> dry<00:02:12.470> you'll<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.069> stamp<00:02:13.519> here

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
when it's dry you'll have a stamp here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.440 
when it's dry you'll have a stamp here
