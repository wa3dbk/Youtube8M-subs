00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:16.580
 which this season has the best 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.810
 result in the world is 1 1366 so she 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.810
 ran into blue 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.739
 You could not kill this result 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:30.149
 kristin with bet is not hesar richardson and this is in 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.369
 In general, to some extent, even 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.550
 Is Sonhawa surprising 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.500
 certainly has good results for 1000 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 meters but still more has always been 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 concentrated at 500 meter 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.399
 distances and here she is two brilliant 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.130
 Results showed the first two days 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.940
 competition of choice ran out 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.940
 of 37 seconds and the second time 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.470
 Yesterday , Dasha installed the world 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.630
 cor 1 world record this season but 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.309
 roll them and you though it is not bad 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.530
 ran a half thousand meters on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.370
 lorry I would lack sharpness 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 sharpness 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.620
 that's 1000 meters should make Katya 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 it is a little bit to correct especially such 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.890
 sharp rival in front of her reach 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.290
 work for and re imei and as 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 benchmark and try to do something 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.660
 on the last lap at least 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.119
 a kitten's personal best of 14 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.340
 Sep 1 and from on 1612 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.710
 this season in calgary a week before 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 start run well, probably home 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.729
 Katya's task is to try now from 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 one of 16 is unlikely to be able to run out 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.810
 compete with 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.060
 Forests whom it is clear that Katya is now bye 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.640
 a little bit lacking seems to me 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 sharpness would be a little bit more powerful 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 invest every move 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.420
 yes so well smoothly such a stud is gaining 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.550
 at a speed of 0 to 1000 meters 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.310
 need a little more but 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.330
 look at a second faster than a week 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.350
 back to calgary 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 1 1513 too cold 1419 Lee San Juan 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.880
 I think that today the result is on the driver 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.190
 there will be a little bit higher from one 14 record 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.670
 rink and he is the world record predlezhit 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:30.010
 Christine with bing 1 1268 is so high 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.989
 the result of a native of melbourne was 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.959
 installed in January of the twelfth year 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.470
 here in calgary 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.530
 but Russia record 1 13 92 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.770
 belongs to olga fatkullin and fatkulin 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.770
 on the eve of st
