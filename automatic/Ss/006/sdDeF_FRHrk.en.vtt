00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.159
 hello how am I the servant yesterday and the day 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:05.879
 today I 'm going to teach you how to prepare 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 quinoa 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 good that is the quinoa the burning 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.280
 basically it's a seed that is very 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.139
 high in proteins low in carbohydrates 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.790
 and zero fat so it's very 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 recommended for everyone in 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.250
 general 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.230
 its price is usually a bit high but 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.939
 it really yields a lot so at 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.739
 end of accounts is not so expensive 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.689
 and it is extremely versatile it serves to 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.700
 many preparations and can 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.829
 combine with many dishes can 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.540
 prepare your quinoa simply and 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.070
 add some salad as 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.739
 garnish of a strong dish or 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.570
 including preparing it specifically 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 as it can be in some taboo read in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.270
 this case I will leave a recipe 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.160
 of a quinoa 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.150
 already with a special preparation but 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.370
 you can do it naturally 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.230
 to make it naturally simply 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.430
 remove the vegetables that I am 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.020
 putting you can change these 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 vegetables put a little bit of 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 mushrooms green beans peas and so on 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.240
 variety is infinite remember that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.740
 you are the chilies in your case and 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.120
 you decide for the rapporteur I am 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.079
 remember that if you liked the video of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.820
 the little hand up 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.079
 subscribe to the channel if at all 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.810
 they have done it and I await your comments 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.610
 here at the bottom and with me 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 for those who have already eaten 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.240
 quinoa and those who would not like them 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.670
 try it and remember that always at 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 end of the videos I leave the recipes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.509
 for those that the ego asks for it and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.090
 they ask me good to tell each other 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.979
 I leave and begin I will use mediates something 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.390
 that not this time the first thing that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.119
 we will do with our that is not going to be 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 wash it unless you have already bought it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.070
 by washing that they have to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.500
 ask where they buy it and this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.960
 we do to remove a surface that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.930
 has the innovation that is bitter 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 we are just going to wash a small 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.390
 rinse and now we are going to drain and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.179
 and prepare here we have our quinoa 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.330
 washed let's do the following I'm going to 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.940
 use a little pepper with medium 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.450
 pepper is enough to use in the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.450
 colors 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.859
 a quarter of onion and this I'm going to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.859
 apply everything very finely 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.099
 and we are least seen to cook 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.710
 I'm going to put some butter on 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.100
 richter 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.100
 I'm going to put a teaspoon of oil and 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.860
 we added our onion and it was encrypted 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.260
 We do not add our foundation no 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.490
 we will arrive at a light sautÃ© very 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.490
 light only 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.490
 I'm going to add my quinoa 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.960
 I'm going to add a cup of water that is the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.680
 double of what I do not do and now if 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.480
 we season a little salt if you like 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 chicken soup 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.190
 I will raise the fire to the maximum and I will 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.799
 cover the one that does not do very similar 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.540
 rice starts to boil as I 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.970
 to lower the fire to the maximum and leave 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.159
 cook on low heat and cover 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.959
 half-hour preference we'll see how 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.330
 we'll be there for five minutes 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.910
 serving and our quinoa is already 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.160
 starting to stay we will move a little and 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.010
 we will wait extra for the air we carry 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.950
 ten minutes and as we will see it is already 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.870
 very little water we will move again and there is 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.129
 to be aware of when we are 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.329
 finish the water 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.849
 the quinoa late in cooking 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.489
 approximately 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.340
 depending on the quantity and the fire 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.260
 have passed our 15 minutes and let's see 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.329
 that our water has evaporated back 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.370
 to cover and see that our quinoa is 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.950
 putting transparent but in this 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.049
 chance they lack a little more if 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.810
 come to pass them this add a 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.730
 little bit more than water they run about 2 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.950
 minutes more and now if they say that it 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.079
 finish cooking with your heat here is 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.900
 list our quinoa let's see how 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.389
 it is observed that it is already transparent 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.280
 and some little dresses have come out 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.680
 as if it were his germ, that's how 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.719
 it has to be doubled in size and it 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.819
 it comes back as if it were germ 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:33.999
 cooked and al dente is the we can 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.979
 accompany with many dishes I've made 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:39.099
 with anything with a salad 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:41.169
 as a side dish of a strong dish is 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.939
 as if it were a kind of rice not 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.849
 there is no limit and here we have it 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.529
 finished our quinoa a recent 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.479
 I hope you like this remind him 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:53.039
 hand above comment on the part of 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.039
 down and see you next time
