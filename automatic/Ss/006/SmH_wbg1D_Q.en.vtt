00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.379
 one of the colt that I had to 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.200
 face the number one in the world 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.959
 as he had done in the end of the wsop 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.990
 in the first big slam that the tower won 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.759
 of tandil and with many points to have in 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.190
 account in this match had to beat him 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.660
 in 12 - in the first two sets 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.400
 run over there we see it to cart estévez 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.050
 who promised to be and finally was 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.670
 present the same thing that the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.040
 crimes like this was also at first 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 row supporting him against tandilense against 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.550
 it seems that will invite all 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.100
 matches it seems that yes it seems that if 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.140
 they talk also there is that a love that there 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.329
 expressed among them we do not get into 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 areas that correspond to us I think if 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.010
 the colt had a very difficult game and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.360
 he really displayed his best tennis 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.710
 showing that he is the best athlete 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.899
 Argentinian at this time in the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.420
 present in this end of 2009 in the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.010
 first set really swept it to swiss 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.540
 for 6 2 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.160
 deploying a drive and a reverse 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.329
 impressive in the second 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.130
 of the colt had the possibility of 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.530
 liquidate the same thing if he stayed with 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.270
 this set a very even set that is not 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.470
 they could break the serve and they got to the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.050
 tie-breaker 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.120
 of the colt was winning 4 to 1 had all 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.680
 the chances like to clean up but 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.570
 that did for something is number 1 of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.210
 world and federer brought out also 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.790
 all his sheet and ended up staying with 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.430
 the second partial and that's how it started 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.680
 complicate the issue because they had 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.300
 to go to the third and final and the photo 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.390
 I had the obligation to earn 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.980
 difference of three game if he did not stay 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.930
 outside it was not going to serve him there we see him 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.630
 you agree to lower your representative 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.910
 and owner of the pass and that's how it was finished 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.010
 giving go 3 to 3 and it looked like it was 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.680
 all outside that the other was not going to be able 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.540
 play the semifinal finally could 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 unfold all blue again 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.470
 guts all his claw and he also 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.240
 ended up staying with the game for 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.430
 the three difference gene and agreed by 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
 first time to the semifinals of this 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.400
 master of london that brings together the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.230
 best eight tennis players in the world now 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.730
 we are seeing the images because 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.920
 then also logically with the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.950
 presence of Carlos Tevez told him 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.090
 I came raiding a little bit with the foal and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.040
 you showed that it is an excellent 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.500
 soccer player for good because I'm going to 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.470
 where the shot handles the feet well with 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.330
 healthy with the hand does not play 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.370
 to soccer and play without him 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 but then he started playing with his foot 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.770
 directly no lady do I have with the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.890

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.730

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.300
 the one that was given not only beating 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.360
 federer 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.260
 accessing the semifinals but also 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.260
 playing a little while with tevez
