while<00:03:05.389> I'm<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:08.750> laptop<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.319> unplugged

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
while I'm and the laptop is unplugged

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:19.289 
while I'm and the laptop is unplugged
just<00:03:10.159> so<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.669> know<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:17.379> now<00:03:18.379> we<00:03:18.439> take<00:03:18.889> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
just so you know that now we take the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:29.070 
just so you know that now we take the
new<00:03:20.299> keyboard<00:03:21.310> which<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.340> right<00:03:22.700> here

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:41.870 

and<00:03:29.410> we<00:03:30.160> face<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.940> down<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:33.720> yeah

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.160 

and<00:03:42.390> then<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.870> think<00:03:43.350> we<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.650> go<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:43.950> good<00:03:44.190> push

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
and then I think we just go to good push

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.730 
and then I think we just go to good push
alright<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:48.780> that's<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.440> about

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
alright so and I think that's just about

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.000 
alright so and I think that's just about
it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.000 
it
now<00:03:50.340> we<00:03:50.930> put<00:03:51.930> back<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.320> here<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:54.800> think<00:03:55.800> I<00:03:55.860> need

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
now we put back in here I think I need

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.120 
now we put back in here I think I need
to<00:03:56.130> chip<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.550> there<00:03:56.850> we<00:03:57.150> go<00:03:57.330> that's<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:58.130> fits

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.970 
to chip it there we go that's it fits
nicely<00:04:00.260> now<00:04:01.260> we<00:04:01.320> push<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.770> little<00:04:02.840> side<00:04:03.980> gives
