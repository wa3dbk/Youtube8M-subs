00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.260
 some time ago when videogames 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.450
 they looked like the hobby of the most geeks 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.519
 and the term gamer did not even exist 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.650
 working playing video games was a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.180
 unattainable dream and with friends what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 more similar than we could imagine was 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.170
 Be betatester with age and maturity 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 It has become obvious that being a beta tester does not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 is far from ideal work that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.930
 of children we imagined however the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.369
 huge growth of the industry and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.840
 the appearance of the spurs has made 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.840
 possible the dream of many 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.079
 i 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.760
 welcome to legends and video games that 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.079
 what of blah blah blah ya ya know the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.030
 rest for some time that I feel like 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.710
 talk about the electronic sports that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.600
 They are where they have gone far they go 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.610
 to arrive have appeared from the ship are 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.079
 moving millions of dollars of course 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.510
 they can no longer be ignored 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.250
 but let's start at the beginning always 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.170
 it is through the controversy of whether they are or 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.330
 not a sport but that you understand 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.770
 you for sport I do not expect 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.119
 you answer by definition a sport is 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.860
 an activity exercised as a game or 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.600
 competition whose practice supposes 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.610
 training and compliance 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.289
 probably think of a handful of 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.210
 people sweating chasing a ball 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.280
 to take it to the opposite field without 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.600
 However, on the other side of the coin, 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.060
 chess for example in its version 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 competitive is considered a sport a 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.320
 intellectual sport a mental battle 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 totally symmetric where two players 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.580
 they compete with each other for defeating their 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.729
 opponent maybe that turns out to be familiar 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.590
 although later we will arrive in this 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.450
 category we could include sports 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.819
 commonly called electronic 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.530
 Martians for those over 50 and 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.720
 in no case considered is a sport 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.069
 as such by the same collective jokes 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.270
 apart to start seeing where 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.170
 come everything we would have to take the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.650
 look pretty 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.909
 good if we go back to the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.650
 early history of the first 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.600
 videogame competitions all 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.640
 begins in the 70s with games like 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.530
 space war or pacman however the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.299
 true origin is in the lan partys 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.009
 and the recreational ones the kids do 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.660
 years among which I include myself 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.860
 We met in telephone booths and cibers or 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.480
 recreational rooms to play 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.220
 video games like counter strike or street 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.810
 fighter with friends is pretty 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.430
 difficult to give dates and say data 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.260
 precise when speaking of the beginnings of the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.970
 electronic sports, as it has 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.220
 gone through the years with others 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.230
 many sports the beginnings are something 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.760
 diffuse everything starts with amateurs 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
 enjoying a new game and it ends 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 with great world competitions like 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.950
 I said at the beginning years ago 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.810
 video games were considered the hobby 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.090
 of the most geek games for kids and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.400
 lots of similar names so 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.160
 that the first global competition of 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.440
 video games back in 1990 was brought to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.530
 out by nintendo and the prize was not 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.940
 nothing more and nothing less than 250 dollars and 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 a trip to the studios universal in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.300
 hollywood for the champion and a game boy 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.150
 for the second 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.860
 a dance mat is pretty obvious 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.990
 that very few people took this 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.430
 class of competitions the prizes 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.020
 they were designed so that all the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.640
 family enjoy a dinner and a 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.890
 trip after the youngest child has 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
 played a while to the tetris this image with 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.680
 time has been deforming and in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.549
 a matter of 20 years we have passed this 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.549
 to this other 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.770
 video games have grown a lot 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.450
 thanks to the evolution of multiplayer 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.130
 that has been there practically since the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.900
 principle if playing video games with 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.490
 Friends is fun with time 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.140
 Internet can do it each from their 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.330
 home or from your own computer still 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.830
 it is more therefore the most video games 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.970
 seen in tournaments and competitions the 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.250
 we can divide into four large 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.200
 genres the shooters on the one hand like 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.090
 call of duty or counter strike the games 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.040
 of fight initiated by street fighter 2 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.160
 strategy video games in time 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.350
 real as starcraft and the moba as dota 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.990
 or league of legends but from among 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.060
 four genres there is one that stands out for 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.760
 on top of others maybe the most 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.190
 important of all the video games of 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.990
 Real-time strategy you expected 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.790
 They said the fashions true good 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.110
 then we will arrive relax a bit that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.240
 you start to see comments saying 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.800
 which of the current fashion is better very 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.170
 similar to the concept of the cable before 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.760
 intellectual battle one against one is 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.980
 starcraft one of the videogames 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.240
 pioneers in the competitive aspect not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.980
 just because of its important weight in the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.390
 development of a new genre that 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.160
 explained in more detail about this other 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.290
 video but by its revolutionaries 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.880
 innovations when starcraft was launched 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.230
 the market was not far from the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.609
 first video game strategy 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.009
 weather 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.439
 he was preceded by well-known sacks like du 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.479
 do not charge with care though starcraft 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.889
 came stomping with three races 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.449
 different balanced and one way 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.430
 multiplayer that allowed us to compete 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.169
 with our friends I will never forget the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.780
 codes black zim or world show me the 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.439
 money and operation remains the same 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.300
 cheating myself that starcraft sold almost 10 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.310
 millions of copies 4 and half of them 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.719
 exclusively in South Korea so that 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.219
 then ask yourself why the leagues 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.199
 professionals are full of Koreans 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.639
 also that there the competitions of 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.409
 videogames appear on television as 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.180
 one more sport the competitions of 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.889
 starclass were among the first 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.479
 rise in popularity and those that 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.250
 they started giving out prizes to have in 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.830
 account to date have been made 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.569
 more than 250 starcraft tournaments and they have 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.569
 distributed almost 6 and a half million 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.250
 dollars in prizes however all the 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.020
 that you know a little the world 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.360
 currently the roost know what 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.919
 move the move to not only require 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.330
 of individual ability but that 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.490
 they need the work of a team of 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.870
 five members understand that those who do not 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.759
 You know the genre may seem 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.020
 confused however in any sport 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.460
 you have to understand a little the rules for 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.419
 be able to enjoy a game or 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.289
 of a competition and if you like 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.719
 regardless of which one is yours 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.210
 preferred one point and separate the esports 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.789
 he scored wolf with his competition 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.800
 endowed with international that in its 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.110
 first delivery in 2011 registered the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.509
 highest prize to date 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.159
 accustomed to awards of 10 20 or 30 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.560
 thousand dollars of prize in the categories 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.300
 highest valve threw the house down the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.539
 window and rewards the champion team with 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.979
 one million and 600 thousand dollars 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.810
 distributed in the lower positions 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.550
 if you are interested you can have a look 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.900
 to the report free to play is in 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.069
 youtube where they show the life of 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.810
 some of the participants of the 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.699
 first edition of the international a 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.439
 Tiny sensational but pretty 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.939
 interesting but not everything stays there 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.279
 this only made it better 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:11.710
 years later in 2014 valve returned it to 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.659
 brown and I think of compendium do not know 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.490
 it's about another different tournament but of 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.740
 a way to grow the prize of 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.810
 your compendium tournament is a kind 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.310
 of the interactive virtual book each 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.680
 unit sold added to the pot two 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.319
 dollars and a half reaching overcoming 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.939
 10 million accumulated dollars of 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.500
 new a record number ever 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.599
 reached by no other competition 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.590
 of videogames to date in just 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.450
 20 years the videos 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.100
 they have gone from being a subculture of 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.870
 more vicious to a mass phenomenon 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.760
 able to move millions of dollars and 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.830
 mobilize hundreds of thousands of people 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.570
 what you are seeing is the end of the 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.700
 world the league of legends all a 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.110
 show with the concert of imagine 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.790
 dragons out there in the middle and a 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.790
 Korean presenter with a lot of gait 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.030
 she 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.390
 and that was all for today what do you think 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.890
 of electronic sports is a subject 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.540
 very interesting recently I saw the final 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.130
 of the lol world that I could not see it in 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.710
 its moment and I was freaking 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.780
 samsung white annihilated royal key in
