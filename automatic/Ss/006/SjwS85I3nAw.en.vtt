00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
around on your nose this mitten is

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.770 
around on your nose this mitten is
sensational<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.610> had<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.210> mitten<00:01:27.570> for

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
sensational I had my other mitten for

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.749 
sensational I had my other mitten for
about<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.170> years<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.610> upgraded

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
about two years and I just upgraded

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.020 
about two years and I just upgraded
which<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> great<00:01:31.790> scrabble<00:01:32.790> double<00:01:33.000> governor

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
which is great scrabble double governor

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.160 
which is great scrabble double governor
so<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> decided<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> reason<00:01:37.020> why<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so I decided that the reason why you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
so I decided that the reason why you
don't<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.920> circles<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.520> because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
don't go around in circles is because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.160 
don't go around in circles is because
that<00:01:38.909> doesn't<00:01:39.420> capture<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> skin

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that doesn't capture the skin

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
that doesn't capture the skin
appropriately<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> beta<00:01:41.250> min<00:01:41.520> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
appropriately with the beta min you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.929 
appropriately with the beta min you
don't<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> best<00:01:42.990> results<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> only

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
don't get the best results so you only

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.530 
don't get the best results so you only
want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.240> side<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> side<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> down
