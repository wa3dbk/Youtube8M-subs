00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.350
 We are here to present the vote with 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:14.699
 first generation because as you can see 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.270
 is a technology phone with which 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.220
 ride an android and as you can see 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.190
 it might look like a phone 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.240
 any one mobile any 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.760
 What does Giotto do with the public? 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.630
 in the world is the second screen that 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.810
 have in the back then for 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.720
 what a second screen can do 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.790
 basically the problem that we have today 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.000
 in day with all these smartphones that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.310
 are coming out is the problem of the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.250
 battery the battery and being able to be 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.830
 connected all the time with the world with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.310
 our family with everything that is 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.470
 around you then what about 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.810
 this screen you can stay in 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.020
 communication with whoever you want you can 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.090
 receive information that without this 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.670
 screen you would lose at the moment in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 that the battery runs out we make a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.220
 example you need to remind yourself of 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 something that will happen for example that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 you have to find this due or not 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 He has his heater with all your stuff 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.400
 I understand 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.870
 you squeeze 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.870
 this good sense here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.920
 in the back you appear touching 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 everything you have to do with all 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.680
 your meetings and everything that interests you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.170
 more then for example 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.780
 here you can put for example your twitter 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.240
 and it's updating 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.640
 in real time you can put your page 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.940
 facebook and it is updated in time 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.060
 real 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.369
 You can put what you want and agree 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.640
 being updated in temporary also what 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.680
 happens is that here they go 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.170
 all messages appear that you 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.260
 they send and all the emails they want 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.110
 to say is clear you could not answer in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.910
 followed but you can decide whether to do it or 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.850
 do not do it 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.400
 without having to understand the first 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.930
 screen then drowning in such a way 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.359
 Battery 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.540
 another thing is that in the mountain in which 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.569
 mobile off because the battery is 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.739
 drop that happens this screen and you want 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.079
 turned on until 50 hours later is 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.170
 because we already call it the jove they are 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.040
 display always on stays 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.260
 always on 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.609
 for what type of server they served 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.829
 for example you are traveling I need is 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.500
 a map let's suppose you do not know 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.609
 barcelona and you have to go from me that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.140
 I know from here to here it's uncovered 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.030
 mobile channel so turn off the mobile and you 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.049
 you have the screen back with the map 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.890
 perfect and you can go see what 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.380
 what do you have to see 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.120
 for example your plane ticket and you 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.120
 you are arriving at the airport and you know that 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.069
 the plane you know that the phone is 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.860
 turning on this time the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.350
 battery you do nothing because you already have 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.970
 your ticket and you can teach it by 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.970
 example other things 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.870
 then you can put whatever you want in the 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.330
 back main screen to say 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.200
 for example this is a girl who ends 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.870
 of going through here very handsome by the way 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.430
 suppose it's my girlfriend hopefully and here 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.769
 I have it behind 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.829
 and then I can add everything I want 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.140
 other things for example here as you see 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.260
 we could add 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.700
 how much has battery when what time 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.120
 does plays and time all this 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.150
 I remember it I repeat it lets not 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.520
 use the front screen what 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.450
 it means that you 're talking matter 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.880
 this part can not be in this 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.340
 version in the next generation that 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.440
 we just presented and that will be 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.870
 available in commerce from 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.870
 November of December in the third and 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.440
 fourth quarter of this year the screen 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.740
 from behind it was also attacked something else very 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.800
 nice is that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.630
 it is a nice mobile that is to say it has things 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.030
 that like this for example this 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.009
 application that says smart for camera 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.500
 extra says in each language says that as 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:54.320
 the camera opened 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.410
 because that's what he does so that the 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.320
 mobile is not only useful, but 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.330
 also fun otherwise for example 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.300
 I have to go to new york I'm not plane 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.030
 I want to see the turn read me a book 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.400
 because if I do not get bored here you have 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.110
 complication has these books choose 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.860
 whatever you want a dracula for example 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.860
 dracula 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.590
 I do not put the screen of asia 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.690
 and I can continue reading as much as I want 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.020
 up to 50 hours I go back and forth twice 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.060
 united states by reading and 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.640
 receiving messages and all without any 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.370
 problem the price on the website is 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.710
 of 499 euros is a very 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.849
 competitive for the same price you 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.279
 you can have 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.279
 two mobiles in one basically
