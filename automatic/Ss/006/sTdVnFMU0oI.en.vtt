the corruption this is what the virus
does<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.710> spawns<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.570> corrupted<00:00:42.570> blocks<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
does it spawns this corrupted blocks and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
does it spawns this corrupted blocks and
they<00:00:44.100> start<00:00:44.489> basically<00:00:45.120> infecting<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> lands

the<00:01:19.979> virus<00:01:20.729> can<00:01:20.939> turn<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.500> desert<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the virus can turn the desert into a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
the virus can turn the desert into a
no-man's<00:01:23.490> land<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.210> matter<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> seconds

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
no-man's land in a matter of seconds

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.380 
no-man's land in a matter of seconds
just<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.850> look<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.030> see<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
just look at this look at me see it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.240 
just look at this look at me see it's
completely<00:01:27.740> devouring<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
completely devouring it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.760 
completely devouring it
and<00:01:30.460> when<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.780> reaches<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.530> end<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
and when it reaches the end of the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.160 
and when it reaches the end of the
desert<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.550> corrupts<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.510> bunch<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:34.990> other

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
desert it corrupts a bunch of other

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.420 
desert it corrupts a bunch of other
blocks<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:37.120> can<00:01:37.480> continue<00:01:38.430> corrupting

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
blocks so it can continue corrupting

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.460 
blocks so it can continue corrupting
even<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:39.880> normal<00:01:40.210> land<00:01:40.450> not<00:01:40.780> just<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.110> desert

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
but seriously look at this no man's lamp

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.870 
but seriously look at this no man's lamp
in<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.810> matter<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.080> seconds<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.520> simply

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
in a matter of seconds that is simply

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.740 
in a matter of seconds that is simply
amazing

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
amazing

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.510 
amazing
also<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.500> corrupted<00:01:47.950> blocks<00:01:48.280> are

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
also the corrupted blocks are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520 
also the corrupted blocks are
unbreakable<00:01:48.970> they're<00:01:49.540> like<00:01:49.870> a<00:01:49.900> bedrock

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
unbreakable they're like a bedrock

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.740 
unbreakable they're like a bedrock
unless<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.190> use<00:01:51.370> create<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> dead<00:01:52.180> zone<00:01:52.450> way<00:01:52.690> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
unless you use create a dead zone way to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.220 
unless you use create a dead zone way to
break<00:01:53.110> them<00:01:53.670> by<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:55.120> using<00:01:55.420> what<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:56.050> mod

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
break them by not using what the mod

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.710 
break them by not using what the mod
offers<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:56.830> also<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.940> corruption<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
offers you also the corruption is

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.630 
offers you also the corruption is
supposed<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.770> slow<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.160> down

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
supposed to slow you down

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.680 
supposed to slow you down
Wow<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.600> makes<00:02:01.870> mops<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.590> bit<00:02:02.800> faster<00:02:03.400> but<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:04.000> am

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
Wow it makes mops a bit faster but I am

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.500 
Wow it makes mops a bit faster but I am
not<00:02:05.310> entirely<00:02:06.310> sure<00:02:06.430> about<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.119> don't

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
not entirely sure about that I don't

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.109 
not entirely sure about that I don't
notice<00:02:07.750> any<00:02:08.649> difference<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.610> now<00:02:09.820> in<00:02:09.970> my

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
notice any difference right now in my

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.990 
notice any difference right now in my
walk<00:02:10.390> speed<00:02:10.660> but<00:02:10.899> maybe<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:12.190> does<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
walk speed but maybe it does that I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.970 
walk speed but maybe it does that I
don't<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:14.200> seriously<00:02:14.560> look<00:02:14.709> at<00:02:14.800> this

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
don't know but seriously look at this

also mops are supposed to give a 10%

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.200 
also mops are supposed to give a 10%
chance<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.350> drop<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.830> inspection<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:30.940> far

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
chance to drop the inspection but so far

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.100 
chance to drop the inspection but so far
I<00:02:31.270> haven't<00:02:31.600> really<00:02:31.990> seen<00:02:32.410> any<00:02:33.070> mob<00:02:33.400> do<00:02:33.640> that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
I haven't really seen any mob do that

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.400 
I haven't really seen any mob do that
but<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.530> what<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.040> topic<00:02:36.430> said<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.910> maybe<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
but it's what the topic said so maybe it

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.670 
but it's what the topic said so maybe it
works<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:38.920> don't<00:02:38.980> know<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.500> much

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
works I don't know there is so much

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.820 
works I don't know there is so much
corruption<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:43.240> this<00:02:43.480> desert<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.530> takes

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
corruption in this desert that it takes

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.850 
corruption in this desert that it takes
a<00:02:45.160> long<00:02:45.430> time<00:02:45.460> for<00:02:46.060> my<00:02:46.240> transfer<00:02:46.630> bald<00:02:46.960> as<00:02:47.680> you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
a long time for my transfer bald as you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.030 
a long time for my transfer bald as you
can<00:02:48.010> see<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.640> fly<00:02:49.510> or<00:02:49.990> walk<00:02:50.500> over<00:02:50.830> there

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
can see I have to fly or walk over there

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.290 
can see I have to fly or walk over there
for<00:02:51.220> them<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.430> load<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.390> anyways<00:02:54.090> yeah<00:02:55.090> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
for them to load but anyways yeah this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
for them to load but anyways yeah this
is<00:02:55.420> basically<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.960> corruption<00:02:56.470> oh<00:02:56.710> my<00:02:57.400> God

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
is basically the corruption oh my God

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.410 
is basically the corruption oh my God
look<00:02:57.790> at<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.150> Wow<00:02:58.750> amazing

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
look at this Wow amazing

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.370 
look at this Wow amazing
it<00:03:01.420> does<00:03:02.080> all<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.950> your<00:03:03.100> land<00:03:03.400> it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it does all of this to your land it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.210 
it does all of this to your land it
generates<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:05.740> random<00:03:06.310> in<00:03:08.040> practically<00:03:09.040> any

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
generates on random in practically any

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.340 
generates on random in practically any
spot<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.910> could<00:03:10.120> be<00:03:10.240> any<00:03:10.390> spot<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:10.990> world

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
spot it could be any spot of your world

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.130 
spot it could be any spot of your world
so<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.770> can<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.610> lot<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:13.120> damage<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.930> your

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
so it can do a lot of damage to your

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.890 
so it can do a lot of damage to your
world<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.610> course<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.090> way<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.300> stop<00:03:16.690> it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
world and of course the way to stop it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.080 
world and of course the way to stop it
the<00:03:17.320> shrine<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.800> notch<00:03:18.010> this<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.610> how<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.880> looks

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
the shrine of notch this is how it looks

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.300 
the shrine of notch this is how it looks
like<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.900> also<00:03:20.110> randomly<00:03:20.710> generated

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
like and it's also randomly generated

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.760 
like and it's also randomly generated
around<00:03:21.610> your<00:03:21.790> world<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.900> as<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.200> can<00:03:23.350> see<00:03:23.410> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
around your world but as you can see the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.100 
around your world but as you can see the
shrines<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.670> are<00:03:24.970> actually<00:03:25.510> quite<00:03:25.840> close

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
shrines of not are actually quite close

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.199 
shrines of not are actually quite close
to<00:03:26.440> each<00:03:26.620> other<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.760> shouldn't<00:03:28.000> be<00:03:28.120> a

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
to each other so that shouldn't be a

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.380 
to each other so that shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.740> way<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.920> actually<00:03:30.390> stop

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
problem but the way you actually stop

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.140 
problem but the way you actually stop
the<00:03:31.570> corruption<00:03:31.870> is<00:03:32.290> by<00:03:32.590> mining<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.160> when

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the corruption is by mining this when

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.420 
the corruption is by mining this when
you<00:03:34.240> mind<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.620> holy<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.190> depth

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
you mind this you get the holy in depth

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.390 
you mind this you get the holy in depth
and<00:03:36.850> with<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.780> can<00:03:38.020> craft<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.920> flame<00:03:39.190> of

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and with it you can craft the flame of

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.490 
and with it you can craft the flame of
not<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:40.240> look<00:03:40.420> at<00:03:40.570> what<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> corruption<00:03:41.320> has

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
not just look at what the corruption has

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.220 
not just look at what the corruption has
done<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.800> this<00:03:41.920> poor<00:03:42.160> tree<00:03:42.520> oh<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.390> humanity

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
done to this poor tree oh the humanity

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.330 
done to this poor tree oh the humanity
but<00:03:45.190> anyways<00:03:45.490> with<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.600> flame<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.840> not<00:03:47.340> once

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
but anyways with the flame of not once

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.750 
but anyways with the flame of not once
you<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.150> basically<00:03:49.300> right-click<00:03:50.140> on

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you have it you basically right-click on

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.130 
you have it you basically right-click on
corrupted<00:03:51.760> blocks<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.390> they<00:03:52.570> will<00:03:52.750> turn<00:03:52.900> back

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
corrupted blocks and they will turn back

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.199 
corrupted blocks and they will turn back
to<00:03:53.290> normal

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
to normal

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.970 
to normal
now<00:03:56.079> if<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.890> ask<00:03:57.040> me<00:03:57.310> there<00:03:57.670> is<00:03:57.909> quite<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> lot

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
now if you ask me there is quite a lot

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.920 
now if you ask me there is quite a lot
updates<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.700> be<00:04:00.819> made<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.390> flame<00:04:01.750> of

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
updates to be made to this flame of

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.869 
updates to be made to this flame of
knotch<00:04:02.670> flint<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.879> steel<00:04:03.939> pinkie<00:04:04.629> because

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
knotch flint and steel pinkie because

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.660 
knotch flint and steel pinkie because
you<00:04:06.879> know<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.390> corruption<00:04:07.900> goes<00:04:08.290> down<00:04:08.950> like

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
you know the corruption goes down like

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.500 
you know the corruption goes down like
below<00:04:10.450> ground<00:04:10.930> level<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.939> for<00:04:12.939> instance<00:04:13.180> I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
below ground level and for instance I

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.929 
below ground level and for instance I
could<00:04:13.569> stay<00:04:14.170> all<00:04:14.590> day<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:15.189> right-clicking

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
could stay all day here right-clicking

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.029 
could stay all day here right-clicking
on<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:16.930> box<00:04:17.229> but<00:04:17.530> there<00:04:17.709> are<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:17.799> lot<00:04:18.009> of

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
on this that box but there are a lot of

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.909 
on this that box but there are a lot of
blocks<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.549> are<00:04:18.750> below<00:04:19.750> them<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.229> as<00:04:20.859> you

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
blocks that are below them and as you

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.830 
blocks that are below them and as you
can<00:04:21.190> see<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.639> corruption<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.120> returning<00:04:22.600> so

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
can see the corruption is returning so

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.189 
can see the corruption is returning so
maybe<00:04:23.500> just<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:24.370> suggestion<00:04:24.789> but<00:04:25.180> an<00:04:25.720> update<00:04:25.990> to

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
maybe just a suggestion but an update to

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.779 
maybe just a suggestion but an update to
this<00:04:26.380> which<00:04:27.060> makes<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.740> uncorrupt<00:04:29.789> like

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
this which makes it to uncorrupt like

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.460 
this which makes it to uncorrupt like
blocks<00:04:31.630> in<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.960> range<00:04:32.229> or<00:04:32.910> maybe<00:04:34.080> disco<00:04:35.080> patch

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
blocks in a range or maybe disco patch

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.840 
blocks in a range or maybe disco patch
of<00:04:35.889> corruption<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:37.210> would<00:04:37.389> be<00:04:37.570> really<00:04:38.110> nice

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
of corruption that would be really nice
