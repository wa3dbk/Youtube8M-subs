we go with legend pieces lithograph this
is<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:33.990> look<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.470> your

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is the one that's I think look at your

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
is the one that's I think look at your
opponent's<00:01:35.009> hand<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.729> hard<00:01:35.970> coastal

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
opponent's hand it's a hard coastal

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.020 
opponent's hand it's a hard coastal
silver<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.549> then<00:01:38.549> we're<00:01:38.729> getting<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
silver one and then we're getting it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.840 
silver one and then we're getting it
into<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.509> older<00:01:39.960> ultra<00:01:40.350> rare<00:01:40.530> stuff<00:01:40.850> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
into some older ultra rare stuff a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
into some older ultra rare stuff a
couple<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> promo<00:01:42.930> yexes<00:01:44.119> promo<00:01:45.119> level<00:01:45.509> x<00:01:48.829> non

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.380 

exas<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:57.070> think<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.729> only<00:01:57.880> one<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.270> has

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
exas I think the only one that has

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.950 
exas I think the only one that has
significant<00:01:58.960> damage<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.590> this<00:02:00.250> clay<00:02:00.549> doll<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
significant damage is this clay doll so

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.249 
significant damage is this clay doll so
that'll<00:02:02.320> be<00:02:02.409> pretty<00:02:02.560> cheap<00:02:03.960> shiny<00:02:04.960> dialga

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
that'll be pretty cheap shiny dialga

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.699 
that'll be pretty cheap shiny dialga
actually<00:02:06.009> maybe<00:02:06.369> up<00:02:06.640> for<00:02:06.670> trade<00:02:07.289> these<00:02:08.289> are

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
actually maybe up for trade these are

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.670 
actually maybe up for trade these are
some<00:02:09.160> secret<00:02:10.000> rares<00:02:10.209> from<00:02:10.690> older<00:02:11.050> sets<00:02:11.319> and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
some secret rares from older sets and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.880 
some secret rares from older sets and
both<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> these<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.209> still<00:02:13.720> sealed<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.440> this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
both of these are still sealed so this

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.990 
both of these are still sealed so this
