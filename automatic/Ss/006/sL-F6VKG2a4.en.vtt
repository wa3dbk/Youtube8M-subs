00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
using again you see me use this tool

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.770 
using again you see me use this tool
just<00:00:33.190> about<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.610> whole<00:00:33.760> time<00:00:33.789> here<00:00:34.570> I'm<00:00:34.660> going

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
just about the whole time here I'm going

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.970 
just about the whole time here I'm going
to<00:00:34.870> be<00:00:34.989> using<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:38.170> cutter<00:00:38.470> here<00:00:38.800> this

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
to be using this this cutter here this

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.639 
to be using this this cutter here this
part<00:00:39.190> by<00:00:39.400> Qatar<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.350> trick<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.380> using

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
part by Qatar and the trick to using

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.380 
part by Qatar and the trick to using
this<00:00:41.920> car<00:00:42.160> broad<00:00:42.370> cutters<00:00:42.790> try<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.060> cut<00:00:43.300> it

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
this car broad cutters try to cut it

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.150 
this car broad cutters try to cut it
right<00:00:43.510> in<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.810> center<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.560> we're<00:00:44.770> going<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.010> be

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
right in the center so we're going to be

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.010 
right in the center so we're going to be
roughing<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:45.790> out<00:00:45.910> here<00:00:46.239> with<00:00:46.420> this<00:00:46.510> carbide

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
roughing it out here with this carbide

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.740 
roughing it out here with this carbide
cutter<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.620> then<00:00:48.610> we'll<00:00:48.790> switch<00:00:48.910> tools<00:00:49.360> and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
cutter and then we'll switch tools and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.660 
cutter and then we'll switch tools and
we'll<00:00:49.899> put<00:00:50.500> some<00:00:50.649> finishing<00:00:50.800> touches<00:00:51.070> on<00:00:51.550> them

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
we'll put some finishing touches on them

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.540 
we'll put some finishing touches on them
so<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:53.260> want<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.500> turn<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.860> on<00:00:54.010> we're<00:00:54.340> going<00:00:54.460> to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
so we want to turn it on we're going to

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.150 
so we want to turn it on we're going to
set<00:00:54.730> our<00:00:54.850> speed<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:56.200> him<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.680> probably

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
set our speed and him with probably

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.950 
set our speed and him with probably
around<00:00:59.160> 650<00:01:00.870> function<00:01:01.870> 700<00:01:02.649> that's<00:01:02.829> okay<00:01:03.960> we

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
around 650 function 700 that's okay we

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.480 
around 650 function 700 that's okay we
might<00:01:05.140> adjust<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.649> up<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.159> start<00:01:06.430> to

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
might adjust it up and we start to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:18.360 
might adjust it up and we start to
finish

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.860 

I<00:01:18.610> like<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.390> take<00:01:19.630> my<00:01:19.690> time<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:22.630> take<00:01:23.280> like

we've still got work to do but on them
I'm<00:02:38.480> gonna<00:02:38.660> change<00:02:38.960> cutter<00:02:39.640> as<00:02:40.640> I've

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
I'm gonna change cutter as I've

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.460 
I'm gonna change cutter as I've
mentioned<00:02:40.910> earlier<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.750> have<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.020> lot<00:02:42.290> more

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
mentioned earlier I have a lot more

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.810 
mentioned earlier I have a lot more
control<00:02:43.090> when<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.180> use<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.630> round<00:02:44.930> cutter<00:02:45.230> so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
control when I use this round cutter so

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.550 
control when I use this round cutter so
I'm<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> go<00:02:47.330> ahead<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.630> start<00:02:48.020> using<00:02:48.290> it

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
I'm going to go ahead and start using it

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.080 
I'm going to go ahead and start using it
now<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.310> we're<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:51.100> shape<00:02:52.100> put<00:02:52.940> some

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
now and we're going to shape put some

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.390 
now and we're going to shape put some
final<00:02:53.420> shape<00:02:53.630> into<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.950> outside<00:02:55.370> of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
final shape into this to the outside of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.660 
final shape into this to the outside of
the<00:02:55.520> base<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.920> we're<00:02:57.920> going<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.130> smooth<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.520> up

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the base and we're going to smooth it up

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.630 
the base and we're going to smooth it up
so<00:02:59.030> we<00:02:59.210> can<00:02:59.330> go<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.780> next<00:02:59.990> step<00:03:00.170> which<00:03:00.640> will

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
so we can go to the next step which will

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400 
so we can go to the next step which will
leave<00:03:02.090> sanding<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:02.960> good<00:03:03.200> ways<00:03:03.380> away

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
leave sanding but we're good ways away

00:03:03.410 --> 00:04:02.090 
leave sanding but we're good ways away
from<00:03:03.740> that<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.490> points

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.380 

okay<00:04:03.100> well<00:04:03.370> we've<00:04:03.550> completed<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.560> turning

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
okay well we've completed the turning

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.260 
okay well we've completed the turning
and<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.600> probably<00:04:07.930> took<00:04:08.230> me<00:04:08.470> about<00:04:09.240> 20<00:04:10.240> minutes

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
and it probably took me about 20 minutes

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.750 
and it probably took me about 20 minutes
maybe<00:04:10.780> maybe<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.560> little<00:04:11.710> over<00:04:12.040> maybe<00:04:12.220> 25

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
maybe maybe a little over maybe 25

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
maybe maybe a little over maybe 25
minutes<00:04:13.210> to<00:04:13.470> turn<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.650> outside<00:04:15.130> of<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.780> his

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
minutes to turn the outside of this his

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.310 
minutes to turn the outside of this his
face<00:04:17.910> turned<00:04:18.910> out<00:04:19.060> really<00:04:19.239> well<00:04:19.360> i<00:04:19.510> think<00:04:19.780> i'm

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
face turned out really well i think i'm

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.880 
face turned out really well i think i'm
pleased<00:04:20.980> with<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.960> our<00:04:22.960> next<00:04:23.200> step<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.740> going

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
pleased with it our next step is going

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.570 
pleased with it our next step is going
to<00:04:23.950> be<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.220> do<00:04:24.340> some<00:04:24.550> sanding<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:26.430> we<00:04:27.430> can

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
to be to do some sanding and we can

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.460 
to be to do some sanding and we can

you can see it turned out pretty well I
think<00:07:05.150> our<00:07:06.150> next<00:07:06.810> step<00:07:07.020> is<00:07:07.500> will<00:07:08.490> be<00:07:08.639> applying

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
think our next step is will be applying

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.569 
think our next step is will be applying
some<00:07:09.300> things
