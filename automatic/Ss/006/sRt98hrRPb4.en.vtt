00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 and the grade guys that as they are 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome again today to a new 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.109
 video the year again small video 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 with respect to what is borea who 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.260
 zombies this time we will make a video for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.599
 try to collect some data 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.769
 again super important again 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.299
 we will talk about a few new 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.190
 activities discovered in what is the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.270
 giant and we have made a very very video 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 similar to this in which they have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.210
 showed the first activities 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.830
 discovered this time have discovered 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.000
 three other activities which 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.650
 we will show during this video and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.390
 we will practically tell you in what 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.710
 they can serve us along the map 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.939
 to comment I know practically 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 what should we do? 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 obviously we must free the giant 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.219
 in a very very simple way 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.719
 We also know that everything will be 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.890
 base of candies we already know 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.300
 practically where can we 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 get equally that we can 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.329
 acquire through a thousand points in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 moment that we want from the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.300
 starting now is exactly where we are going 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.250
 to show what would be the first 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.899
 skill of which new ones have been 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 discovered we know we can 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.199
 get what is a random weapon what 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 what is the box we know that we have a 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.739
 cost of 950 points but we also know 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.270
 that most goods may not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.190
 we are very lucky that maybe we do not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690
 pulls out such a good weapon and then 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.789
 we can use the giant to treat 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.809
 to have a second chance 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.339
 we will notice that in this case I get 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990
 what is a shotgun and what I do is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880
 give him 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.770
 in the candy just from the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.780
 side against what is the giant box 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.640
 again it was the same reaction that has 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.649
 done whenever we give him the candies 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.420
 this time approach the box with the hits 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.490
 in a very strange way and what it will do 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.229
 it's again to get a random weapon 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.789
 that can come to us very well would be 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.899
 practically as if we had a 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.549
 second chance in the box 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.380
 obviously paying only the first 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.750
 I think it would save me from a few 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.070
 and we could do very, very well in 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.539
 this case we do not have change what is 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 a shotgun for what would come to be what 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.899
 rooted in which comes super super 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.039
 well for the second game 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.750
 activity that we will try to show the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.310
 today we know practically that we 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.690
 you can leave some stories power ops 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.819
 at the end of the rounds with the last 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.440
 zombie and we also get a forum in the 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:47.209
 which year in a very good way what 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.590
 which is the game this time we can 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.940
 use the giant to try to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.890
 change what is the power that we have 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.780
 come out we will only use the same 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.580
 method giving him the candies justly 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.289
 behind what is dread or now 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.209
 practically the same gesture and what 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.799
 will magically be will almost exchange 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.390
 the favor that has come out for us 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.770
 new for a random one but that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.209
 equally we have could we have a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.549
 little luck and maybe we would come very 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.660
 well no dread has acquired let's 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.039
 continue with the third activity and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.600
 practically to culminate what is 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.520
 this video too 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.530
 the new giant will be able to help us 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.820
 make activity an activity of this 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.650
 way which good I think that equally 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.480
 it is something very very strange what the truth 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 nor would I have imagined that we could 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.020
 perform has to do in relation to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.430
 what comes to be the crol you are like that 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.840
 the zombies that are left without legs and 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.700
 they just crawl 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 all over the map this time what we will do 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.730
 is to approach what would be a color is 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.290
 we practically always leave it to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 end of the rounds and what they will do 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.110
 practically the same will be the same 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.360
 moment will try the candies 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.770
 just in front of him but read what 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.690
 that was the giant will be practically the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.030
 same gesture always give a good turn 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.410
 of 180 degrees and what it will do will be something 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
 quite quite strange really I 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.220
 I did not imagine that I could do this 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.260
 we will notice that what it will do is load the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.960
 Colonel in his arms like that is a way 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.060
 very weird very strange we will notice that what 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.130
 get it just as if it were your baby or 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.230
 your baby in a way that we could 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 say we will notice that at a certain point what 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.400
 lull and the really aware that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 a way that really makes me laugh I think 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.640
 I could not come to them in the desert 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.800
 point in some good way she that 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.990
 this giant what he will do will be justly 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.670
 to chase after you with just 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.260
 the color in very long arms 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.050
 pretty funny and good could we 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.310
 come in some way well and what 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.200
 maybe we'll have to do some 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 How many steps on the map do I know and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.560
 good so maybe the colonel is not 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.900
 lose could show the whole with the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.220
 giant in arms so practically 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.600
 so far the video I should have xico 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.740
 let's hope they have you served with these 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.270
 three new skills that have 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.580
 discovered in what exists in this 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.020
 new power map hopefully it will be 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.340
 of a later recovery since 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.380
 well we have found new data 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.700
 new information things come 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.200
 pretty good to know a little bit what 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.310
 which is the map so I really hope 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.390
 I have served you this video I hope 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.650
 You will have liked them do not forget 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.060
 tell us what you think about this video 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.260
 They know they can give us a like for 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.700
 that more people can get to see 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.050
 this video so well the clairvoyant 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 wants to be reminded that if they are and 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.870
 kilos is fine is fine tomorrow with a 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.730
 new video with a new gameplay 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.720
 commented for you see you later 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.720
 bye
