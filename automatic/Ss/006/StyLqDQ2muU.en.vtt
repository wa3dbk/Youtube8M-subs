do like WPA and stuff but no probs so

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.339 
do like WPA and stuff but no probs so
you<00:02:27.439> put<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.709> here<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:29.150> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.840> cable<00:02:30.200> ran

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
you put that here then kind of cable ran

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.099 
you put that here then kind of cable ran
all<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> way<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:31.040> Ethernet<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> foot<00:02:31.730> on

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
all the way to the Ethernet a foot on

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.460 
all the way to the Ethernet a foot on
the<00:02:33.109> blu-ray<00:02:33.530> player<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.220> back<00:02:34.370> there

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the blu-ray player in the back there

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.580 
the blu-ray player in the back there
what<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.620> does<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:37.099> bridges<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.590> network

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
what that does is bridges the network

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.160 
what that does is bridges the network
through<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.099> adapter<00:02:40.579> here<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.030> puts<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
through this adapter here and puts the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.530 
through this adapter here and puts the
blu-ray<00:02:42.769> player<00:02:42.799> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.819> network<00:02:44.349> and<00:02:46.540> so

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
blu-ray player on the network and so

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.640 
blu-ray player on the network and so
yeah

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.570 

turn<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.489> old<00:02:53.520> blu-rays<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:55.580> monitor

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
turn on the old blu-rays here monitor

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.949 
turn on the old blu-rays here monitor
will<00:02:56.700> come<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.300> just<00:02:57.599> a<00:02:57.690> second

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.640 

hopefully<00:03:04.489> yep<00:03:05.870> see<00:03:06.870> there<00:03:07.349> we<00:03:07.470> got<00:03:07.620> our

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
hopefully yep see there we got our

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.460 
hopefully yep see there we got our
various<00:03:08.610> internet<00:03:09.000> apps<00:03:09.209> now<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.750> know<00:03:10.349> where

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
various internet apps now I know where

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.020 
various internet apps now I know where
the<00:03:10.530> remote<00:03:10.709> side<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.940> make

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the remote side so that's going to make

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.509 
the remote side so that's going to make
it<00:03:12.120> hard<00:03:12.269> for<00:03:12.390> me<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> demonstrate<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:13.050> but

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
it hard for me to demonstrate this but

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.320 
it hard for me to demonstrate this but
basically<00:03:14.519> that's<00:03:14.940> just<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.150> cheap

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
basically that's just a cheap

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.960 
basically that's just a cheap
alternative<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:19.849> buying<00:03:20.849> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
alternative to you know buying the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.170 
alternative to you know buying the
stupid<00:03:21.330> adapter<00:03:21.720> thing<00:03:21.930> for<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:23.220> blu-ray<00:03:23.430> but

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
stupid adapter thing for the blu-ray but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.360 
stupid adapter thing for the blu-ray but
this<00:03:25.080> thing<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.560> know<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:26.040> refer<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> I

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
this thing you know I just refer you I

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.220 
this thing you know I just refer you I
think<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.910> work<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.330> IT<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.780> got<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.049> from

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
think I I work on IT and I got this from

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.740 
think I I work on IT and I got this from
work<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.620> few<00:03:28.769> years<00:03:29.040> ago<00:03:29.390> they<00:03:30.390> were<00:03:30.450> throwing

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
work a few years ago they were throwing

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.539 
work a few years ago they were throwing
it<00:03:30.840> away<00:03:30.930> because<00:03:31.080> it's<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.620> only<00:03:31.739> does<00:03:31.890> B<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it away because it's it only does B so

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.680 
it away because it's it only does B so
which<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.540> fine<00:03:33.810> because<00:03:34.019> most<00:03:34.709> American

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
which is fine because most American

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.509 
which is fine because most American
internet<00:03:36.690> speeds<00:03:36.959> don't<00:03:37.260> surpass<00:03:37.799> B's

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
internet speeds don't surpass B's

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:45.440 
internet speeds don't surpass B's
maximum<00:03:40.280> bandwidth<00:03:41.510> anyway<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:44.120> but<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.299> all

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
maximum bandwidth anyway so but it's all

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.380 
maximum bandwidth anyway so but it's all
good<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.769> thought<00:03:47.700> I'd<00:03:47.819> share<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.209> with

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
good so I thought I'd share that with

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.720 
good so I thought I'd share that with
you<00:03:48.630> quick<00:03:49.110> little<00:03:49.230> quick<00:03:50.220> well<00:03:50.370> quick<00:03:50.580> and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
you quick little quick well quick and

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.780 
you quick little quick well quick and
dirty<00:03:50.849> setup<00:03:51.239> that<00:03:51.950> while<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.069> isn't<00:03:53.220> very

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
dirty setup that while it isn't very

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.720 
dirty setup that while it isn't very
sophisticated<00:03:54.030> gets<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.630> job<00:03:54.810> done<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.730> like

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
sophisticated gets the job done so like

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.860 
sophisticated gets the job done so like
I<00:03:56.850> always<00:03:56.880> will<00:03:57.120> put<00:03:57.209> up<00:03:57.299> another<00:03:57.450> video<00:03:57.570> when

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
I always will put up another video when

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.910 
I always will put up another video when
