will<00:00:10.320> bring<00:00:10.410> up<00:00:10.530> your<00:00:10.650> passcode<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.490> I'll

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
will bring up your passcode and I'll

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.600 
will bring up your passcode and I'll
just<00:00:12.330> punch<00:00:12.540> mine<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.049> here<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.519> already

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
just punch mine in here and I already

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.120 
just punch mine in here and I already
had<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.940> loaded<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.509> settings<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.619> if

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
had it loaded to the settings here so if

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.439 
had it loaded to the settings here so if
you<00:00:17.250> want<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.490> find<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.240> go

you want to find this you can just go

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.640 
you want to find this you can just go
under<00:00:19.010> general<00:00:20.010> right<00:00:20.730> there<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.410> it<00:00:22.410> has

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
under general right there and it has

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.470 
under general right there and it has
settings<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:23.910> pretty<00:00:24.180> straightforward

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
settings so it's pretty straightforward

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
also go here passcode lock and that is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
also go here passcode lock and that is
where<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.320> punch<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:40.800> passcode<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
where you can punch in your passcode to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
where you can punch in your passcode to
prove<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:44.010> turn<00:00:44.309> the

prove that it's you and you can turn the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
prove that it's you and you can turn the
passcode<00:00:44.940> off<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
passcode off if you want you have to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.520 
passcode off if you want you have to
punch<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> again<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> change<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
punch it in again you can change the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
punch it in again you can change the
passcode<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.670> well<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:51.059> order<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.360> do

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
passcode here so well in order to do

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.470 
passcode here so well in order to do
that<00:00:51.600> we'll<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.079> turn<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.620> just

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
that we'll have to turn it on just

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
that we'll have to turn it on just
punched<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> few<00:00:54.930> times<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> that's<00:00:56.340> where

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
punched in a few times and that's where

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.189 
punched in a few times and that's where
you<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.699> hit<00:00:56.879> change<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you just hit change right there it's a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
you just hit change right there it's a
change<00:00:58.469> passcode<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> either

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
change passcode so you can either

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.080 
change passcode so you can either
require<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.960> passcode<00:01:01.559> immediately<00:01:02.309> after<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
require the passcode immediately after a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810 
require the passcode immediately after a
minute<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:04.530> after<00:01:04.739> four<00:01:04.769> hours<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
minute or even after four hours and that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670 
minute or even after four hours and that
longer<00:01:06.450> time<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> new<00:01:07.409> feature

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
longer time is actually a new feature

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
longer time is actually a new feature
for<00:01:08.159> iOS<00:01:08.700> 7<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> pretty<00:01:09.540> cool<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> can

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
for iOS 7 which is pretty cool you can

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.969 
for iOS 7 which is pretty cool you can
do<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> simple<00:01:11.580> pass<00:01:11.909> code<00:01:12.680> which<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
do a simple pass code which will just

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.440 
do a simple pass code which will just
punch<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> again<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.150> add<00:01:15.330> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
punch that and again you have to add it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.910 
punch that and again you have to add it
a<00:01:15.540> lot<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.780> times<00:01:15.960> or<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> new

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
a lot of times or you can do a new

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.390 
a lot of times or you can do a new
passcode<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> much<00:01:19.320> longer<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> can

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
passcode which is much longer so you can

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
passcode which is much longer so you can
do<00:01:21.020> test<00:01:22.159> pass<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.580> something<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.320> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
do test pass or something like that so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.980 
do test pass or something like that so
we'll<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.560> type<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.810> can<00:01:27.810> always

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
we'll just type that in can always

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
we'll just type that in can always
change<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.290> later<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.280> we'll<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.610> hit<00:01:29.700> done

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
change it later and we'll just hit done

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.679 
change it later and we'll just hit done
and<00:01:30.470> now<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.479> all

of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> settings<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.350> after<00:01:47.280> four<00:01:47.520> hours

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
of the settings so after four hours

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.550 
of the settings so after four hours
we'll<00:01:47.970> ask<00:01:48.149> me<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> type<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> longer

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
we'll ask me to type in that longer

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
we'll ask me to type in that longer
password<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> general<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.810> all

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
password but in general it's now all

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
password but in general it's now all
updated<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> always<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
updated and you can always go to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.969 
updated and you can always go to
settings<00:01:54.149> again<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.439> makes<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> really

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
settings again and it makes it really

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.910 
settings again and it makes it really
easy<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.670> manipulate<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> hope<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.740> makes

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
easy to manipulate so I hope that makes

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
easy to manipulate so I hope that makes
sense<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.460> let<00:01:59.850> me<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> any
