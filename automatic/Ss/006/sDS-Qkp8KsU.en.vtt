so that actually adds a little bit of

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.440 
so that actually adds a little bit of
dimension<00:03:57.070> because<00:03:57.520> it's<00:03:57.670> not<00:03:57.760> simply<00:03:58.120> black

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
dimension because it's not simply black

dimension because it's not simply black
it<00:03:58.780> like<00:03:59.110> twists<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.590> game<00:03:59.800> up<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.100> little<00:04:00.130> bit

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
it like twists the game up a little bit

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.460 
it like twists the game up a little bit
it<00:04:00.760> kind<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.060> innovates<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.990> game<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.440> you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470
