00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.039
 how much more 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.640
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.770
 video in which I'll talk about the cube with the 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.910
 that I began to attract cubes 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.699
 rubik's this is a cube of the brand 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.089
 hasbro which I bought it just for 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.930
 teach my brother but the truth is 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.320
 a cube that I do not recommend at all 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.670
 due 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.150
 to what it offers you for a price that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.600
 for me it is very high because I do not 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.809
 offers you in comparison to other cubes 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.520
 that are a little cheaper this is not 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.369
 offers the cutting of corners neither the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.080
 reverse cut none of that has this 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.240
 cube so it's lousy to do 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.720
 speech 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.000
 the truth is very rigid of the first 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.750
 you take it out of the packaging 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.490
 comes very rigid and with the passage of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 time if it is loosening but that of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.590
 the cut of corners does not give you 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.470
 at least if you a little longer 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.770
 Actor then 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 Well, as I repeat, it was just a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 cube that I bought it to teach me to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 assemble the rubik's to teach me how to put together 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.110
 a rubik cube which I already know 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.630
 but the truth again I repeat that no 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 it's from a cube I like for nothing 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.660
 why 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.660
 comparing it with a diane sanchis 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170
 here I have it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.989
 comparing it with a widening 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.630
 the daliÃ¡n sanchis is very soft is very 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.540
 soft has the advantage that it has the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.620
 Corner cutting the reverse cut 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.620
 it's soft 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.170
 Another disadvantage that the hasbro has is 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.010
 that the stickers to the three days that the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.360
 use the three days of use and is 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:57.220
 they were lifting the stickers 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.050
 which then looks very ugly 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.050
 the bucket looks very ugly 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.969
 and good here is he 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.760
 the hasbro cube comes with its base comes 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:13.810
 with its instructions to assemble which 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.810
 the extra good 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:23.330
 more than anything I think that hasbro 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.530
 he made them as an exhibit as 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 collection as a souvenir of those 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.140
 times when the cube was invented 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:39.460
 rubik because he does not have any 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.460
 specific feature that can be highlighted 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.110
 succubus, I do not think that's why 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.850
 they just pulled out this cube so for 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.320
 fun because for nothing that is good 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.320
 this cube is very bad 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.159
