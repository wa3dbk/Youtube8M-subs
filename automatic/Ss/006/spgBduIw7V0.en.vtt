00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.510 
the I guess all the interviews it looks
very<00:04:52.490> arcane<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:54.379> don't<00:04:55.159> know<00:04:55.249> that's<00:04:55.460> just

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
very arcane and I don't know that's just

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.010 
very arcane and I don't know that's just
my<00:04:55.729> personal<00:04:56.090> opinion<00:04:56.150> yes<00:04:56.569> they<00:04:56.749> said<00:04:56.930> the

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
my personal opinion yes they said the

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.899 
my personal opinion yes they said the
pores<00:04:57.229> of<00:04:57.349> physics<00:04:57.710> are<00:04:57.860> there<00:04:58.159> but<00:04:59.060> it's<00:04:59.210> very

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
pores of physics are there but it's very

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.570 
pores of physics are there but it's very
very<00:05:01.909> light<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.919> don't<00:05:03.919> know<00:05:03.979> how<00:05:04.189> to<00:05:04.250> say<00:05:04.460> it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
very light I don't know how to say it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.519 
very light I don't know how to say it
but<00:05:04.759> I<00:05:05.060> don't<00:05:05.479> think<00:05:05.689> that<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:05.990> physics<00:05:06.379> are

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
but I don't think that the physics are

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.200 
but I don't think that the physics are
really<00:05:06.830> going<00:05:06.949> to<00:05:07.009> be<00:05:07.129> there<00:05:07.310> that's<00:05:08.090> your

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210
