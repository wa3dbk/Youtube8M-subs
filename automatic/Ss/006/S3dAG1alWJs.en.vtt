now the Giants knob is computer

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.680 
now the Giants knob is computer
generated<00:05:13.130> because<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:14.090> National<00:05:14.419> Trust

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
generated because the National Trust

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.330 
generated because the National Trust
didn't<00:05:14.930> want<00:05:15.080> us<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.199> film<00:05:15.470> on<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.770> real<00:05:15.919> thing

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
didn't want us to film on the real thing

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.860 
didn't want us to film on the real thing
because<00:05:16.729> they<00:05:16.910> didn't<00:05:17.120> want<00:05:17.270> people<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:17.720> in

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
because they didn't want people to in

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.510 
because they didn't want people to in
what<00:05:18.229> we're<00:05:18.410> doing<00:05:18.440> here<00:05:18.889> because<00:05:19.190> apparently

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
what we're doing here because apparently

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.219 
what we're doing here because apparently
they<00:05:19.699> did<00:05:19.910> do<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.780> that's<00:05:20.990> all

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
they did do it so that's all

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.950 
they did do it so that's all
computer-generated<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:22.310> giant<00:05:22.699> know<00:05:23.360> till

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
computer-generated that giant know till

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.270 
computer-generated that giant know till
he<00:05:24.050> really<00:05:24.320> do<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.500> but<00:05:24.800> where's<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.100> harm

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
he really do that but where's the harm

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.610 
he really do that but where's the harm
in<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.580> well<00:05:26.180> I<00:05:26.419> just<00:05:26.539> didn't<00:05:26.900> want<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.110> do<00:05:27.350> it

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
in that well I just didn't want to do it

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.230 
in that well I just didn't want to do it
so<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:27.979> to<00:05:28.070> say<00:05:28.220> as<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.460> credits<00:05:28.820> begin<00:05:29.090> to

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
so just to say as the credits begin to

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.230 
so just to say as the credits begin to
roll<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:31.010> was<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.160> helicopter<00:05:31.789> shot<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.180> the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
roll that was a helicopter shot and the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.520 
roll that was a helicopter shot and the
original<00:05:32.389> idea<00:05:32.810> was<00:05:32.930> we<00:05:33.080> would<00:05:33.260> start

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
original idea was we would start

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.070 
original idea was we would start
close-up<00:05:34.099> on<00:05:34.340> Hugh<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.699> jelly<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.690> pull

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
close-up on Hugh and jelly and and pull

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.260 
close-up on Hugh and jelly and and pull
away<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.470> reveal<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.099> giant<00:05:37.400> snob<00:05:37.639> but<00:05:37.849> it

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
away to reveal the giant snob but it

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.270 
away to reveal the giant snob but it
took<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:38.599> long<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:39.169> reveal<00:05:39.500> kind<00:05:39.860> of<00:05:39.979> you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
took so long that the reveal kind of you

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.830 
took so long that the reveal kind of you
know<00:05:40.310> was<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.699> bit<00:05:40.880> boring<00:05:41.060> so<00:05:41.300> we'd<00:05:41.449> started<00:05:41.720> to

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
know was a bit boring so we'd started to

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.740 
know was a bit boring so we'd started to
reverse<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.289> shot<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.490> we<00:05:44.000> zoom<00:05:44.419> in<00:05:44.599> on

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
reverse the shot and so we zoom in on

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.219 
reverse the shot and so we zoom in on
you<00:05:44.949> ah<00:05:45.949> and<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.820> very<00:05:47.000> cold<00:05:47.330> morning<00:05:47.930> you<00:05:48.199> and
