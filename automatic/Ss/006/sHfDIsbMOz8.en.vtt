even by whole wheat standards it is

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.460 
even by whole wheat standards it is
rather<00:01:02.940> dense<00:01:03.650> this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.920> regular<00:01:05.400> white<00:01:05.909> flour

white flour to about 4 cups four and
half<00:01:19.290> cups<00:01:19.619> however<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.310> takes<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
half cups however much it takes of the

half cups however much it takes of the
whole<00:01:21.299> wheat<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:22.140> also<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> double<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
whole wheat I'm also going to double the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
whole wheat I'm also going to double the
amount<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.090> yeast<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.990> effort<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
amount of yeast in an effort to get that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.160 
amount of yeast in an effort to get that
leavening<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> there<00:01:27.000> more<00:01:27.240> quickly<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
leavening in there more quickly to get a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
leavening in there more quickly to get a
better<00:01:28.320> rise<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.340> hopefully<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> much

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
better rise and hopefully get a much

mine my second batch to rise to about
there<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.140> see<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.470> rather<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bit

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
there you see it's rather it's a bit

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.280 
there you see it's rather it's a bit
like<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> brick<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.900> perfectly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
like a brick right now it's perfectly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
like a brick right now it's perfectly
acceptable<00:01:40.439> thats<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> style<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.000> the

pioneer<00:01:42.509> days<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.619> 2008<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> do

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
pioneer days but this is 2008 we can do

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.840 
pioneer days but this is 2008 we can do
better<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.590> first<00:01:46.860> thing<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.189> did<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.640> we

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
better the first thing we did was we

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
better the first thing we did was we
took<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.270> third<00:01:48.540> cup<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.869> water<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.950> 1

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
took one third cup of water with 1

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
took one third cup of water with 1
teaspoon<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:51.119> sugar<00:01:51.149> with<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> two<00:01:52.290> packets

of<00:01:52.890> yeast<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.460> combine<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.360> idea<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
of yeast we combine that the idea is to

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
looks like it's going to be meant they

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.420 
looks like it's going to be meant they
look<00:06:12.080> better<00:06:12.259> than<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.680> two<00:06:12.860> loaves<00:06:13.099> that<00:06:13.340> I

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
look better than the two loaves that I

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.029 
look better than the two loaves that I
made<00:06:13.639> before<00:06:13.789> without<00:06:14.479> the<00:06:14.810> white<00:06:15.020> flour<00:06:15.349> so

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
made before without the white flour so

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.350 
made before without the white flour so
I'm<00:06:16.340> just<00:06:16.460> going<00:06:16.610> to<00:06:16.699> pop<00:06:16.879> them<00:06:17.120> in<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.270> oven

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
I'm just going to pop them in the oven

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.559 
I'm just going to pop them in the oven
at<00:06:17.919> 400<00:06:18.919> fahrenheit<00:06:19.430> for<00:06:19.699> about<00:06:19.729> 30<00:06:20.300> minutes

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
at 400 fahrenheit for about 30 minutes

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.939 
at 400 fahrenheit for about 30 minutes
and<00:06:20.840> we'll<00:06:21.469> see<00:06:21.710> what<00:06:21.860> we<00:06:21.979> get<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:24.500> bread<00:06:24.740> is

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
and we'll see what we get the bread is

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.999 
and we'll see what we get the bread is
now<00:06:25.099> but<00:06:25.340> has<00:06:25.669> been<00:06:25.969> cooked<00:06:26.270> for<00:06:26.599> bait<00:06:27.110> for<00:06:27.500> 30

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
now but has been cooked for bait for 30

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.469 
now but has been cooked for bait for 30
minutes<00:06:28.280> and<00:06:28.550> I've<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:28.699> been<00:06:29.000> a<00:06:29.060> quickly

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
minutes and I've just been a quickly

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.980 
minutes and I've just been a quickly
brush<00:06:29.750> on<00:06:30.020> a<00:06:30.289> little<00:06:30.889> melted<00:06:31.879> butter<00:06:31.990> because

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
brush on a little melted butter because

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.070 
brush on a little melted butter because
the<00:06:33.889> top<00:06:34.099> is<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.460> bit<00:06:34.759> dry<00:06:35.000> out<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.479> the<00:06:35.569> oven<00:06:35.780> and

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
the top is a bit dry out of the oven and

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.260 
the top is a bit dry out of the oven and
if<00:06:36.530> you<00:06:36.650> don't<00:06:36.919> do<00:06:37.159> that<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.610> find<00:06:37.940> you<00:06:38.090> could

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
if you don't do that I find you could

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.559 
if you don't do that I find you could
break<00:06:38.509> your<00:06:38.690> teeth<00:06:39.490> it<00:06:40.490> still<00:06:40.909> it<00:06:41.180> does<00:06:41.389> not

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
break your teeth it still it does not

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.920 
break your teeth it still it does not
look<00:06:41.840> as<00:06:42.080> risen<00:06:42.529> as<00:06:42.800> perhaps<00:06:43.490> a<00:06:44.120> white<00:06:44.539> loaf<00:06:44.750> of

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
look as risen as perhaps a white loaf of

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.469 
look as risen as perhaps a white loaf of
bread<00:06:45.110> but<00:06:45.409> it<00:06:45.529> still<00:06:45.800> is<00:06:46.150> basically<00:06:47.150> a<00:06:47.180> whole

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
bread but it still is basically a whole

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.659 
bread but it still is basically a whole
wheat<00:06:47.719> loaf<00:06:47.930> of<00:06:48.110> bread<00:06:48.319> so<00:06:48.919> let's<00:06:49.430> see<00:06:49.639> what

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
wheat loaf of bread so let's see what

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.939 
wheat loaf of bread so let's see what
it's<00:06:49.969> like<00:06:50.180> when<00:06:50.750> I<00:06:50.810> turn<00:06:51.110> it<00:06:51.289> out<00:06:51.409> on<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:51.770> rack

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
it's like when I turn it out on the rack

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:54.629 
it's like when I turn it out on the rack
let<00:06:52.279> it<00:06:52.400> cool<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.909> then<00:06:52.969> we'll<00:06:53.270> cut<00:06:53.479> into<00:06:53.779> it

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
let it cool and then we'll cut into it

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.700 
let it cool and then we'll cut into it
well<00:06:55.639> we<00:06:55.940> had<00:06:56.240> it's<00:06:56.930> been<00:06:57.139> in<00:06:57.259> the<00:06:57.349> oven<00:06:57.500> for

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
well we had it's been in the oven for

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.760 
well we had it's been in the oven for
half<00:06:57.919> hour<00:06:58.370> is<00:06:58.729> now<00:06:59.029> cooled<00:06:59.479> and<00:06:59.870> I'm<00:07:00.500> going<00:07:00.710> to

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
half hour is now cooled and I'm going to

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.320 
half hour is now cooled and I'm going to
cut<00:07:00.979> into<00:07:01.250> this<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.639> we're<00:07:01.729> going<00:07:01.909> to<00:07:01.940> compare

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
cut into this and we're going to compare

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.959 
cut into this and we're going to compare
it<00:07:02.479> with<00:07:02.509> the<00:07:02.659> previous<00:07:03.259> loaf<00:07:03.589> I<00:07:03.860> think<00:07:04.639> Otto

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
it with the previous loaf I think Otto

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.890 
it with the previous loaf I think Otto
it<00:07:05.659> already<00:07:06.110> looks<00:07:06.229> like<00:07:06.589> it's<00:07:06.889> it's<00:07:07.339> lighter

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
it already looks like it's it's lighter

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.779 
it already looks like it's it's lighter
but<00:07:08.900> we'll<00:07:09.080> just<00:07:09.289> cut<00:07:09.529> through<00:07:09.740> it<00:07:09.979> and<00:07:10.129> just

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
but we'll just cut through it and just

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.700 
but we'll just cut through it and just
see<00:07:11.089> it's<00:07:11.389> not<00:07:11.599> going<00:07:11.900> to<00:07:11.990> be<00:07:12.110> store-bought

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
see it's not going to be store-bought

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.079 
see it's not going to be store-bought
light<00:07:13.039> because<00:07:14.000> it's<00:07:14.210> not<00:07:14.449> full<00:07:14.870> of

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.089 
light because it's not full of

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:19.450 
light because it's not full of
unpronounceable<00:07:17.199> chemicals<00:07:18.199> to<00:07:18.469> fluff<00:07:19.129> it<00:07:19.310> up

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
unpronounceable chemicals to fluff it up

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.749 
unpronounceable chemicals to fluff it up
and<00:07:19.789> this<00:07:20.120> is<00:07:20.270> all<00:07:20.479> natural<00:07:20.810> it<00:07:21.379> is<00:07:21.919> real<00:07:22.279> bread

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
and this is all natural it is real bread

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.409 
and this is all natural it is real bread
look<00:07:23.300> at<00:07:23.419> that<00:07:23.629> now<00:07:24.259> this<00:07:24.469> is<00:07:24.529> before<00:07:25.419> using

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 
look at that now this is before using

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:31.930 
look at that now this is before using
just<00:07:26.990> natural<00:07:28.779> whole<00:07:29.779> wheat<00:07:30.129> this<00:07:31.129> I<00:07:31.370> added

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
just natural whole wheat this I added

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.800 
just natural whole wheat this I added

double<00:07:36.169> packet<00:07:36.650> of<00:07:36.830> yeast<00:07:36.889> and<00:07:38.199> you<00:07:39.199> can<00:07:39.379> see

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 
double packet of yeast and you can see
