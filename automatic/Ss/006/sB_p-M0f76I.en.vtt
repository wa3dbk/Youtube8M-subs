00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.080 

thought<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:55.750> was<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> really<00:01:56.170> kind<00:01:56.650> of<00:01:57.090> pricing

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
thought it was a really kind of pricing

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.760 
thought it was a really kind of pricing
but<00:01:58.300> you<00:01:58.450> know<00:01:58.600> there<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:58.990> signature

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
but you know there is a signature

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.010 
but you know there is a signature
increase<00:02:00.370> their<00:02:02.010> value<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.570> if<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:07.990> a

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
increase their value so if you have a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.780 
increase their value so if you have a
look<00:02:08.260> quick<00:02:08.619> look<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.010> not<00:02:09.190> too<00:02:09.340> bad<00:02:09.460> but<00:02:09.640> if

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
look quick look is not too bad but if

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.040 
look quick look is not too bad but if
you<00:02:09.910> look<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.090> perspective<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.780> quite<00:02:11.020> a

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
you look the perspective is quite a

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
you look the perspective is quite a
disaster<00:02:11.380> but<00:02:11.770> anyway<00:02:12.160> their<00:02:13.120> riders<00:02:13.360> have

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
disaster but anyway their riders have

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.140 
disaster but anyway their riders have
not<00:02:14.040> fingers<00:02:15.040> when<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.760> picture<00:02:16.090> is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
not fingers when this picture is

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.460 
not fingers when this picture is
actually<00:02:16.270> there<00:02:16.690> was<00:02:16.780> no<00:02:16.930> exhaust<00:02:17.260> pipe

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
actually there was no exhaust pipe

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.160 
actually there was no exhaust pipe
thought<00:02:17.740> it's<00:02:17.920> an<00:02:18.100> electric<00:02:18.490> bike<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:20.020> there

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
thought it's an electric bike but there

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.750 
thought it's an electric bike but there
was<00:02:20.290> clutch<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.830> right<00:02:20.980> side<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.490> would

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
was clutch on the right side so I would

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.150 
was clutch on the right side so I would
I<00:02:22.000> was<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.080> really<00:02:23.230> sure<00:02:23.350> what<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> bike<00:02:23.950> was

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
I was not really sure what the bike was

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.360 
I was not really sure what the bike was
I<00:02:24.430> think<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.030> child<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.570> nine<00:02:25.930> ten<00:02:26.709> years<00:02:26.740> old

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
