00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.160 

so<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> pulley<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> rear<00:01:36.329> end<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.840> real

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
so the pulley on the rear end is real

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.609 
so the pulley on the rear end is real
small<00:01:37.469> now<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.390> wasn't<00:01:40.020> able<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> clear<00:01:40.469> all

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
small now and I wasn't able to clear all

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.099 
small now and I wasn't able to clear all
this<00:01:40.740> stuff<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.250> clutch<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:42.109> shifter

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
this stuff the clutch and the shifter

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:45.830 
this stuff the clutch and the shifter
mechanism<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> had<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.179> put<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> pole

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
mechanism there so I had to put a pole

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
mechanism there so I had to put a pole
just<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.289> idler<00:01:46.590> pulley<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.369> that's

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
just an idler pulley up here that's

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.209 
just an idler pulley up here that's
actually<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> serpentine<00:01:49.740> belt<00:01:49.799> that's

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
actually for a serpentine belt that's

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.319 
actually for a serpentine belt that's
for<00:01:50.459> a<00:01:50.659> 4.3<00:01:51.659> liter<00:01:51.869> Chevy<00:01:52.500> motor<00:01:52.939> but<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> seems

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
for a 4.3 liter Chevy motor but it seems

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
for a 4.3 liter Chevy motor but it seems
to<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.450> working<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.500> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to be working really good for this in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.740 
to be working really good for this in
the<00:01:56.280> front<00:01:56.490> bully<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.149> left<00:01:59.450> stock<00:02:00.450> pulley

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the front bully I just left stock pulley

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.690 
the front bully I just left stock pulley
I<00:02:06.140> disconnected<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> governor<00:02:08.610> room

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I disconnected the to the governor room

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.440 
I disconnected the to the governor room
which<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.940> right<00:02:09.269> here<00:02:10.880> no<00:02:11.880> longer<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
which is right here no longer is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
which is right here no longer is
connected<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> throttle<00:02:13.470> blade<00:02:13.650> which<00:02:13.860> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
connected to the throttle blade which is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.119 
connected to the throttle blade which is
right<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.569> use<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.170> brake

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
right here now I just use the brake

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.660 
right here now I just use the brake
cable<00:02:17.549> off<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.150> bicycle<00:02:19.340> seat<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:20.549> it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
cable off of a bicycle seat because it

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.150 
cable off of a bicycle seat because it
for<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.879> brake<00:02:21.660> lever<00:02:21.900> up<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.379> when<00:02:23.040> you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
for this brake lever up here when you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.479 
for this brake lever up here when you
move<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.519> lever<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:25.099> pulls<00:02:26.099> within<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
move that lever just pulls within the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.839 
move that lever just pulls within the
throttle<00:02:26.849> blade<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:29.310> way<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.459> don't<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.819> a

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
throttle blade that way I don't have a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.990 
throttle blade that way I don't have a
governor<00:02:30.920> it's<00:02:31.920> more<00:02:32.250> fun<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.489> drive<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.910> like

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
governor it's more fun to drive it like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.280 
governor it's more fun to drive it like
that<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:34.639> the<00:02:35.639> choke<00:02:35.940> which<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.329> this<00:02:36.510> back

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
that to the choke which is this back

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.020 
that to the choke which is this back
here<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:39.569> can<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.079> rod<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:41.459> spring<00:02:41.880> is

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
here you can see that rod that spring is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.140 
here you can see that rod that spring is
actually<00:02:42.180> one<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.690> added<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
actually one that I added to the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.390 
actually one that I added to the
throttle<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.739> throttle<00:02:47.069> returns

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
throttle so that the throttle returns

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.620 
throttle so that the throttle returns
itself<00:02:47.730> when<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> let<00:02:48.180> off<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.420> gas

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
itself when you let off the gas

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.819 
itself when you let off the gas
but<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.680> rod<00:02:49.950> goes<00:02:50.400> back<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:52.380> mechanism

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
but that rod goes back to this mechanism

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.170 
but that rod goes back to this mechanism
and<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.700> would<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.060> where<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.540> stock<00:02:55.380> choke

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
and that would be where the stock choke

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
and that would be where the stock choke
is<00:02:57.180> connected<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.859> you<00:02:59.010> watch<00:02:59.220> that<00:03:00.200> you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
is connected so if you watch that you

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.809 
is connected so if you watch that you
see<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.500> choke<00:03:01.799> getting<00:03:02.310> turned<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.609> off

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
see the choke getting turned on off

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.360 
see the choke getting turned on off
there<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.389> still<00:03:03.660> left<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.900> intact<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.310> I

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
there so I still left that intact so I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.610 
there so I still left that intact so I
can<00:03:05.519> use<00:03:05.669> that<00:03:05.700> as<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> choke<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.419> then<00:03:06.660> once

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
can use that as the choke and then once

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.140 
can use that as the choke and then once
the<00:03:07.769> engine<00:03:08.040> starts<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.609> just<00:03:08.730> pull<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the engine starts I can just pull that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.420 
the engine starts I can just pull that
off

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
off

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.370 
off
and<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:11.609> handy<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:15.569> handlebars<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
and that's handy the handlebars I just

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.120 
and that's handy the handlebars I just
used<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.769> big<00:03:17.010> nut<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:19.260> with<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
used a big nut and one with that to the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.509 
used a big nut and one with that to the
bars

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
bars

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.430 
bars
I<00:03:20.730> cut<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> bars<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.599> walled<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> nut<00:03:22.260> in

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
I cut the bars and walled of the nut in

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.470 
I cut the bars and walled of the nut in
and<00:03:22.739> then<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.280> took<00:03:23.370> this<00:03:23.639> sleeve<00:03:23.970> off<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.389> the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
and then I took this sleeve off of the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360 
and then I took this sleeve off of the
stock<00:03:24.720> steering<00:03:24.780> wheel<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.889> this<00:03:25.950> wallet<00:03:26.220> that

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
stock steering wheel on this wallet that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.289 
stock steering wheel on this wallet that
to<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.639> nut<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.370> gearing<00:03:29.669> on<00:03:29.970> these<00:03:30.180> marie's

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
to the nut the gearing on these marie's

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.610 
to the nut the gearing on these marie's
it's<00:03:33.299> actually<00:03:33.750> nice<00:03:33.959> whenever<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's actually nice whenever you have a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.309 
it's actually nice whenever you have a
steering<00:03:35.010> wheel<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.599> it's<00:03:36.599> easy<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.109> turn

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
steering wheel because it's easy to turn

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.199 
steering wheel because it's easy to turn
them<00:03:37.500> but<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.859> problem<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.939> put

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
them but the problem if you put

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.699 
them but the problem if you put
handlebars<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.959> there<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.349> have<00:03:40.439> to<00:03:40.560> turn

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
handlebars on there is you have to turn

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.920 
handlebars on there is you have to turn
the<00:03:40.860> handlebars<00:03:41.159> around<00:03:41.610> like<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:42.780> two

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the handlebars around like one or two

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.880 
the handlebars around like one or two
times<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.650> know

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
times you know

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.360 
times you know
to<00:03:44.069> get<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.430> thing<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.670> turn<00:03:44.990> so<00:03:46.220> what<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.250> did

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
to get the thing to turn so what I did

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.699 
to get the thing to turn so what I did
was<00:03:47.550> made<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.970> piece<00:03:48.840> longer<00:03:49.350> by<00:03:49.530> just

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
was made this piece longer by just

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.050 
was made this piece longer by just
welding<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.069> piece<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> metal<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.700> drilling

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
welding a piece of metal on it drilling

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.880 
welding a piece of metal on it drilling
a<00:03:51.150> hole<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:53.990> because<00:03:54.990> stock<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.590> bolt

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
a hole in it because stock this bolt

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.100 
a hole in it because stock this bolt
would<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.160> been<00:03:56.280> closer<00:03:56.730> in<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> pivot

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
would have been closer in to the pivot

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.390 
would have been closer in to the pivot
point<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.530> further<00:03:58.740> away<00:03:58.950> from<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.250> pivot

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
point the further away from the pivot

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.260 
point the further away from the pivot
point<00:03:59.550> you<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.000> make<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:02.580> faster<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
point you can make that the faster the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.870 
point you can make that the faster the
steering<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.690> going<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.580> did<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.700> same

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
steering is going to be I did the same

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.850 
steering is going to be I did the same
in<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> front<00:04:06.390> but<00:04:06.660> only<00:04:07.440> instead<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.770> moving

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
in the front but only instead of moving

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.490 
in the front but only instead of moving
it<00:04:08.100> away<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.640> was<00:04:08.820> far<00:04:09.660> away<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.900> moved<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.350> real

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
it away it was far away I moved it real

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.250 
it away it was far away I moved it real
close<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:11.420> now<00:04:12.420> whenever<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.959> move<00:04:13.110> the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
close so now whenever you move the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.780 
close so now whenever you move the
steering<00:04:14.270> see<00:04:15.270> just<00:04:15.450> moving<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.840> little<00:04:15.989> bit

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
steering see just moving it a little bit

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.419 
steering see just moving it a little bit
moves<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> wheel<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.180> lot
