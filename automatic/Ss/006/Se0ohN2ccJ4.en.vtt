00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
difference between the two is at 370 and

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.460 
difference between the two is at 370 and
at<00:05:57.990> 570<00:06:00.140> let's<00:06:01.140> see<00:06:01.410> in<00:06:01.500> terms<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.980> thickness

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
at 570 let's see in terms of thickness

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.900 
at 570 let's see in terms of thickness
how<00:06:04.470> much<00:06:04.650> do<00:06:04.800> they<00:06:04.920> differ<00:06:08.420> each<00:06:09.420> other

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
how much do they differ each other

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.970 
how much do they differ each other
correct<00:06:12.800> as<00:06:13.800> you<00:06:13.980> can<00:06:14.160> see<00:06:14.490> even<00:06:15.000> here<00:06:15.440> at<00:06:16.440> 570

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
correct as you can see even here at 570

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.020 
correct as you can see even here at 570
is<00:06:17.160> we<00:06:17.700> but<00:06:17.940> thicker<00:06:18.540> than<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.990> said<00:06:19.170> 370<00:06:20.030> not

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
is we but thicker than the said 370 not

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.230 
is we but thicker than the said 370 not
all<00:06:21.150> that<00:06:21.300> much<00:06:21.480> though<00:06:22.670> you<00:06:23.670> can<00:06:23.850> see<00:06:24.120> the

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
all that much though you can see the

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.240 
all that much though you can see the
difference<00:06:24.570> here<00:06:27.860> quite<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:28.890> neat<00:06:29.100> little

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 
difference here quite a neat little

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.990 
difference here quite a neat little
design<00:06:29.730> and

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
design and

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.340 
design and
for<00:06:31.570> people<00:06:31.870> who<00:06:32.020> are<00:06:32.400> more<00:06:33.400> conscious<00:06:33.850> about

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.350 
for people who are more conscious about

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.020 
for people who are more conscious about
portability<00:06:35.350> of<00:06:35.620> the<00:06:35.770> laptop<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.490> carrying

portability of the laptop and carrying

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.620 
portability of the laptop and carrying
it<00:06:37.120> around<00:06:37.590> then<00:06:38.590> about<00:06:38.770> 370<00:06:39.580> he<00:06:39.700> gives<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:40.090> very

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
it around then about 370 he gives a very

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.490 
it around then about 370 he gives a very
good<00:06:40.840> option<00:06:41.040> we're<00:06:42.040> in<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:43.750> power<00:06:44.050> that<00:06:44.350> is

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
good option we're in the power that is

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.640 
good option we're in the power that is
