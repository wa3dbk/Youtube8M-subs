here's a little brain and temple

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.709 
here's a little brain and temple
twisting<00:00:08.580> exercise<00:00:09.059> I'd<00:00:09.270> like<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.570> all<00:00:09.600> to

try we're gonna play this one with a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.820 
try we're gonna play this one with a
metronome<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.990> want<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.260> get<00:00:13.440> used<00:00:13.709> to

metronome and I want you to get used to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.099 
metronome and I want you to get used to
playing<00:00:13.980> two<00:00:14.279> quarters

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
playing two quarters

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.010 
playing two quarters
two<00:00:16.109> eighths<00:00:16.770> -<00:00:17.220> triplets<00:00:17.640> -<00:00:18.300> sixteenth<00:00:18.779> notes

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
two eighths - triplets - sixteenth notes

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.319 
two eighths - triplets - sixteenth notes
with<00:00:19.770> your<00:00:19.949> thumb<00:00:20.390> evenly<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.039> precisely

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
with your thumb evenly and precisely

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.279 
with your thumb evenly and precisely
we'll<00:00:24.329> do<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> first<00:00:24.839> with<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.079> bounce

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
we'll do it first with the bounce

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.259 
we'll do it first with the bounce
technique<00:00:25.829> and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.579> we'll<00:00:26.730> try<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:26.999> with<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
technique and then we'll try it with the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
technique and then we'll try it with the
up<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.710> know<00:00:28.829> start<00:00:29.189> these

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
up and down and you know start these

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.630 
up and down and you know start these
slow<00:00:29.759> to<00:00:30.720> make<00:00:30.839> sure<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> find<00:00:31.859> you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
slow to make sure that you can find you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.640 
slow to make sure that you can find you
know<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.790> correct<00:00:33.180> timing<00:00:33.720> sometimes<00:00:34.470> it's

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
know the correct timing sometimes it's

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.229 
know the correct timing sometimes it's
hard<00:00:34.860> at<00:00:34.980> first<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.310> go<00:00:35.489> from<00:00:35.700> triplets<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
hard at first to go from triplets to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.439 
hard at first to go from triplets to
quarter<00:00:36.540> notes<00:00:36.980> but<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.370> practice<00:00:38.699> it<00:00:39.090> or

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
quarter notes but if you practice it or

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.299 
quarter notes but if you practice it or
if<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.199> even<00:00:40.289> have<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> drum<00:00:40.920> machine<00:00:41.039> you

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
if you can even have a drum machine you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.939 
if you can even have a drum machine you
can<00:00:41.460> set<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.910> play<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.359> actual<00:00:42.719> time<00:00:42.989> so

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
can set up to play the actual time so

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.099 
can set up to play the actual time so
you<00:00:44.039> can<00:00:44.190> hear<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.519> difference<00:00:45.109> without

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
you can hear the difference without

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:47.959 
you can hear the difference without
rushing<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.859> think<00:00:47.250> it'll<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.519> real<00:00:47.760> help

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
rushing it I think it'll be a real help

00:00:47.969 --> 00:01:32.899 
rushing it I think it'll be a real help
so<00:00:48.359> let's<00:00:48.629> give<00:00:49.199> this<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.500> good<00:00:49.890> luck

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.490 

now<00:01:33.909> let's<00:01:34.119> try<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.450> with<00:01:34.750> our<00:01:34.780> up-and-down

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
now let's try it with our up-and-down

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.050 
now let's try it with our up-and-down
thumb<00:01:35.860> technic<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.880> wish<00:01:39.880> me<00:01:40.450> what
