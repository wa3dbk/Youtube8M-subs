00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
around with the rest of them is you

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.700 
around with the rest of them is you
could<00:00:51.699> actually<00:00:51.909> change<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.659> duration<00:00:53.199> of

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
could actually change the duration of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.130 
could actually change the duration of
the<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.670> speed<00:00:54.999> of<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.179> animation<00:00:55.269> you<00:00:55.989> see

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
the the speed of the animation you see

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.319 
the the speed of the animation you see
how<00:00:56.229> slow<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.679> is<00:00:56.800> now<00:00:57.069> it<00:00:57.579> was<00:00:57.879> much<00:00:58.059> faster

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
how slow it is now it was much faster

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.700 
how slow it is now it was much faster
before<00:00:58.749> so<00:00:59.589> you<00:00:59.679> go<00:00:59.829> ahead<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.069> you<00:01:00.219> just<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
before so you go ahead and you just and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.410 
before so you go ahead and you just and
there<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.069> go<00:01:03.100> I'm<00:01:03.789> going<00:01:03.909> to<00:01:03.999> go<00:01:04.089> ahead<00:01:04.120> and

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
there you go I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.680 
there you go I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.570> down<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.290> save<00:01:05.650> some<00:01:05.860> time<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:07.540> can

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
put that down to save some time you can

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.510 
put that down to save some time you can
go<00:01:07.840> ahead<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.020> enable<00:01:08.350> fade<00:01:08.770> while<00:01:09.040> animating

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
go ahead and enable fade while animating

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.210 
go ahead and enable fade while animating
you<00:01:09.940> could<00:01:10.090> also<00:01:10.270> add<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.659> doc<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.470> mean<00:01:12.010> add<00:01:12.190> a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
you could also add a doc I mean add a

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.760 
you could also add a doc I mean add a
row<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.030> springboard<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:14.050> requires<00:01:14.650> a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
row to the springboard that requires a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.430 
row to the springboard that requires a
respring<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.450> page<00:01:16.750> that's<00:01:17.110> where<00:01:17.380> you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
respring you have page that's where you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.990 
respring you have page that's where you
can<00:01:17.590> go<00:01:17.710> ahead<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:17.950> configure<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:18.760> want

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
can go ahead and configure if you want

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.790 
can go ahead and configure if you want
them<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.180> be<00:01:19.450> hide<00:01:19.720> if<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.140> want<00:01:20.320> them<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.500> move

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
them to be hide if you want them to move

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.100 
them to be hide if you want them to move
with<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.370> duck<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.940> here<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.080> have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
with the duck and here you have

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.020 
with the duck and here you have
activation<00:01:23.860> method<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.520> can<00:01:24.640> go<00:01:24.820> ahead<00:01:24.910> and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
activation method you can go ahead and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.090 
activation method you can go ahead and
select<00:01:25.300> activation<00:01:26.200> method<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:27.070> the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
select activation method but I like the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.150 
select activation method but I like the
default<00:01:27.610> method<00:01:27.790> when<00:01:28.450> I<00:01:28.510> just<00:01:28.780> swipe<00:01:29.110> down<00:01:29.800> on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
default method when I just swipe down on

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.950 
default method when I just swipe down on
my<00:01:30.310> duck<00:01:30.580> instead<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.150> having<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.540> do<00:01:31.780> that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
my duck instead of having to do that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.930 
my duck instead of having to do that
separately<00:01:32.380> here<00:01:33.160> you<00:01:33.340> can<00:01:33.460> go<00:01:33.700> ahead<00:01:33.790> and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
separately here you can go ahead and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.940 
separately here you can go ahead and
select<00:01:34.210> how<00:01:34.390> many<00:01:34.570> fingers<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.230> want<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.710> use

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
select how many fingers you want to use

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.760 
select how many fingers you want to use
you<00:01:36.370> can<00:01:36.490> use<00:01:36.550> two<00:01:37.030> or<00:01:37.240> three<00:01:37.600> or<00:01:37.810> one<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.410> lot

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
you can use two or three or one is a lot

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.340 
you can use two or three or one is a lot
more<00:01:39.010> convenient<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.820> also<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> lot<00:01:40.480> faster<00:01:41.020> so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
more convenient and also a lot faster so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.960 
more convenient and also a lot faster so
I'm<00:01:41.440> going<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.650> enable<00:01:41.920> add<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.340> row<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.880> then

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
I'm going to enable add a row and then

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.210 
I'm going to enable add a row and then
we<00:01:43.180> spring<00:01:43.420> my<00:01:43.540> device<00:01:43.870> and<00:01:44.260> as<00:01:44.740> you<00:01:44.860> guys<00:01:44.890> can

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
we spring my device and as you guys can

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.250 
we spring my device and as you guys can
see<00:01:45.280> after<00:01:45.670> my<00:01:46.000> device<00:01:46.360> has<00:01:46.600> really<00:01:46.930> sprung

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
see after my device has really sprung

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.220 
see after my device has really sprung
how<00:01:47.560> come<00:01:48.490> close<00:01:48.850> up<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.240> app<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:49.750> i<00:01:49.780> could<00:01:50.110> go

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
how come close up the app so i could go

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.460 
how come close up the app so i could go
ahead<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.530> probably<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:53.050> move<00:01:53.290> our

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
ahead and probably just go and move our

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.710 
ahead and probably just go and move our
appt<00:01:53.650> over<00:01:54.070> extremely<00:01:54.760> quickly<00:01:55.050> sbsettings
