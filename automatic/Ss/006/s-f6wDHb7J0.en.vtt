00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
cut it towards the bottom which would be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.160 
cut it towards the bottom which would be
wrong<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.960> the

that I cut it near the top which would

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.610 
that I cut it near the top which would
be<00:00:58.440> wrong<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:59.329> you<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> king

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
