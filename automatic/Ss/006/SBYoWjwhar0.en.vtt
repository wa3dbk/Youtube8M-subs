00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.670
 hello my dear, I 'm not a Sergio teacher 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.880
 bautzer our follow this is ours 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.560
 second class about the law 10 257/2001 good 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.740
 to the letter of the law 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.930
 Therefore, Law 10 357 establishes 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.890
 control and inspection of products 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.619
 chemicals that directly or indirectly 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.670
 can be used for the preparation and 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.250
 list of narcotic substances 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.290
 psychotropic disorders or which 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.030
 physical or psychological dependence and 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.300
 other measures 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.940
 like I told you it's the one we had 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.310
 over time an ordinance of the year of 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.380
 1981 of the last century 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.840
 It's good that you started controlling three 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.070
 chemicals used in the preparation and 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.060
 drug production 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.700
 then we had UN and water conventions 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.640
 and so to regulate listening to such 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.829
 conventions and for the greater fight against 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.479
 drug trafficking were edited law 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:13.000
 9,017 to 10,357 of 2001 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.710

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 control as planned 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.079
 in this law in its manufacture production 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.469
 storage packaging processing 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.049
 purchase / sale marketing acquisition is 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.060
 that I jumped possession donation loan 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.950
 question shipping distribution distribution 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 import export re-export 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.520
 recycling 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.840
 transfer use all 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.090
 chemical products that can be 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.139
 used as inputs in the preparation of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.770
 substance psychotropic drugs 

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:48.189
 or to determine psychotropic 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.529
 personal or physical psychic dependence 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.409
 we have the criminal law the difference 

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:55.709
 between raw material in disappear product 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.119
 chemical is just a matter of curiosity 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.759
 raw material to make this shirt 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.279
 of cotton is cotton the raw material 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.619
 or input is all that is going to be 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:07.749
 used in the production of this 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.860
 cotton all right then there is the article 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.500
 1 st 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.750
 come on old pardon article 1 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.630
 paragraph to the first sentence applies if 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 this article substances

 narcotics or psychotropic 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.790
 determines physical or psychic dependence 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.010
 which are not under the control of the

 Ministry of Health reminds us 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.040
 that remedy that there are some students

 but they use to sleep that they are with 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.609
 It's not that you're studying there. 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.500
 Can you relax and then that's right? 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.159
 administrative and functional logic 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.799
 Computing 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.909
 the subject to take rivotril and

 ethyl chloride it can be used as 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.659
 chemical indeed the very club 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.489
 shooting it has its role in the production and 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.769
 drug preparation but the procon 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.620
 thilo guides you to perfume him 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.930
 alone it 's a good drug

 station I worked I 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.129
 worked 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.109
 I'm working in the city today. 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.930
 satellite of santa maria personal us 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.840
 we made a pension a product that never 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.729
 he had seen soldering before and the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.040
 anti splash sun was being used 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.680
 It's just like the drugs the staff was complying with. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.349
 It is consumed before welding drop seems 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.859
 in that in the composition there chloride 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.629
 ethyl okay come on paragraph 2 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.579
 for the purpose of implementing the 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.010
 control and supervision provided for in this 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.690
 law is considered to be a chemical 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.840
 substances and formulations 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.799
 containing them in concentrations 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.840
 established in an ordinance in any 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.900
 physical state regardless of name 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.000
 of the product and its use ready to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.919
 which is intended as I said in our 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.479
 first class are four tables by 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.849
 less until the year 2010 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:15.159
 and you will not need to know unless 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.019
 in the future if you are going to give 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.620
 competition for people for expert scrivener 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.990
 and they cover the administrative acts 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.849
 which regulate this law here an article 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.639
 2nd most important 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.289
 the minister of justice of office without him 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.190
 to have anyone's provocation 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.449
 due to the dpf proposal of the 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.750
 Yes, the forgiveness 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.590
 the minister of justice or all 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.960
 well then himself 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.560
 justice without provocation from anyone or 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.450
 with the provocation of the dpf of sinad 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.490
 the anvisa define the ordinance the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.440
 chemicals to be controlled and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.050
 where necessary to promote its 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.910
 excluding update including products 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.940
 as well as to establish the criteria and 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.790
 form of personal control every day 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.910
 new drugs appear to simulate the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.320
 inspections of chemicals are 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.660
 contracted by large organizations 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.660
 to produce drugs 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.550
 As I said, only marijuana does not 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.870
 uses our own chemical in the 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.080
 its production 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.580
 slept with new drugs every day 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.190
 good if new drugs come every day is 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.680
 necessary to update the ordinances 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.660
 or updates are required 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.670
 Good ordinances, how will it work? 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.670
 this update the Minister of Justice 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.310
 himself or if he was provoked by the 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.610
 dpf federal police department 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.440
 by scenery or anvisa it will 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.090
 define by will be defined in ordinance the 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.000
 chemicals to be controlled and 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:50.680
 when necessary it will include one or 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.680
 delete everything ok
