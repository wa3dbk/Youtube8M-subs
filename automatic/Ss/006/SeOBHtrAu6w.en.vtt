will<00:01:52.740> admit<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.280> used<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.820> guilty<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
will admit to I used to be guilty of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.940 
will admit to I used to be guilty of
this<00:01:54.329> when<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:54.930> young<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.469> 19

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
this when I was really young like 19

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
this when I was really young like 19
when<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> first<00:01:56.220> learned<00:01:56.729> how<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.210> brows

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
when I first learned how to do my brows

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
when I first learned how to do my brows
but<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.039> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
but you want to make sure you do a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.770 
but you want to make sure you do a
gradient<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.909> gradient<00:02:00.060> has<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.539> go<00:02:00.630> in

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
gradient but the gradient has to go in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.090 
gradient but the gradient has to go in
the<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:00.960> direction<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.679> what<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the right direction so what you want to

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.460 
the right direction so what you want to
do<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.460> make<00:02:03.210> sure<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.810> lighter<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.409> of

look lifted and a lot of times what I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.660 
look lifted and a lot of times what I
see<00:02:27.930> happen<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.560> people<00:02:28.709> bring<00:02:29.489> their

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
see happen is people bring their
highlight<00:02:30.030> down<00:02:30.299> too<00:02:30.540> far<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> kind<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
highlight down too far so it kind of

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.490 
highlight down too far so it kind of
makes<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.640> under<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.510> brow<00:02:33.810> part<00:02:34.260> look

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
really really big and it accentuates it

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.240 
really really big and it accentuates it
just<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.380> bit<00:02:37.470> too<00:02:37.650> much<00:02:37.799> so<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.069> want

reverse raccoon look so I just took a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.030 
reverse raccoon look so I just took a
consumer<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.870> matched<00:04:58.110> my<00:04:58.350> skin<00:04:58.380> and
