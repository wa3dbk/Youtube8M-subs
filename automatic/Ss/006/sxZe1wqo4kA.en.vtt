00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:41.660
 Hydroparm is now a company that spreads such practices in Korea . 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:46.280
 Then you can just as true brothers up its production method is also defined legs, but imports 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:52.610
 Would happen should there be, depending on the productivity then we talk 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:59.479
 Productivity When I compare my thoughts in Korea, is it too different? 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:03.500
 For example, lettuce is an example . 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:09.290
 In our way, you will be producing grilled batteries. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.290
 It is the kind of farming method that can produce 20 seeds. 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.440
 There's no one to believe when you talk. 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:22.220
 Agriculture also has economies of scale 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:25.760
 And if you chat with the right farming method, you're competitive enough. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 It's a business that's profitable . 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.750
 I'm making a jar now to show these things. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:45.450
 Esu anuimyeon positive What for example in the space of the horizontal extent 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:46.920
 Safe and nutritious ingredients without fertilizer or pesticide 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.850
 Feed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 So-called winter , which can produce stable regardless of the weather regardless of the year 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 To say 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 Uh, we can feed the plant, one of the farmers buying plant rain about now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.940
 Save up to 50% 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:15.180
 Another Besides tooth for always above the soot radeunga the axis immunity 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:19.860
 Livestock competitiveness is getting stronger. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:25.770
 Because you are not accustomed, do what anyone has not done . 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.570
 There is no one to do so, so this is good for cattle. 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.910
 Reviews are also reduced to 10 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:36.080
 If you only have five cycles, the effect is very short 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080
 I think I will do this. 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.050
 Of course, the second system 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:50.060
 The intellectual property rights are well protected through the registration of the jet core . 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:56.900
 I have filed an application with the specialization agency directly at home in Korea . 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:00.890
 When I use it for two years, I pay 360,000 won per bird. 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.770
 So if you change this to a fresh investigation, 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.240
 Therefore , 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:13.340
 Private savings are $ 190 million 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:18.440
 I'm sorry, it will be close to 1,700,000 won . 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:23.300
 How much money they need to produce a hand in some of the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.770
 The labor cost is 4 won, 1 cost is 1 won 550 won 600 won 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.130
 About 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:33.440
 Next comes the imported hay 4, 500 won and 600 won. 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:38.510
 * Jogel I make one key, and the price is about 100 won 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.690
 Geureolkka the best bigger.Can said the price was a lot of day one 5900 1350 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:46.730
 The key is to think of the model 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.380
 4,700 M The smallest model produced at 250 kg is a 3700 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.890
 Degree 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.780
 Then, as you can see from the standpoint of farmers , 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.210
 5th floor 900 million one year old is when the number of times now already abroad 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 The second day of Season 2 is long. 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:10.820
 Everyone has been around for a decade or so, and Australia does not need this system 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:17.860
 There are already about 1000 in the market and the US British turkey seed is actually 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:19.889
 I think that our b0 income is just the cost and I intend to breathe . 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.650
 won 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:28.110
 The next big thing is now the financial goal 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:37.949
 There may be an intrinsic goal, a static goal 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:39.660
 Will produce 50 billion won in sales in three years . 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.110
 4 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:48.360
 Then , with that goal outside the budget , 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:52.470
 Bath whether the configuration is in everyone is now 60-50 itself 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.640
 What is our country now 50s 60s social structure is still rapid 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:01.110
 As it turns 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:05.210
 Now 1 6 70% is true and 10 house is the minimum cultivation that 1.5 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.190
 It is necessary to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.270
 Investment costs are lucky enough 15000000000 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:18.150
 80 that 80 percent say there are about a billion people 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.280
 Cover the company receives a loan from the rest of the information that they then jabudam 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.050
 Billions 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:28.710
 Although I had a variety of experiences in the past, 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.510
 These people give an opportunity to life, for example. 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:36.420
 So bring me that if each of 10,005 10 million won For the Company As Well 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.370
 While those shareholders 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.050
 With that employee 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:47.669
 9 million won in revenue to invest 50 million yuan 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:54.439
 It takes about 40 million won to pay 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:59.689
 Then it 's a very good model for return on investment. 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:06:04.099
 There's a place where we can continue to do more important things . 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:09.510
 So Hydro included two 50s and 60s who got a chance to chaos 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:12.990
 But at least through the name method 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:17.460
 People with enough experience in the second half 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.480
 It's enough to show you that you can play as a player 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.930
 It means something. 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.930
 Head marketing is stabbing somewhere. 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 U
