00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.500 
drive it once you're done messing around
you<00:05:26.890> can<00:05:27.070> drive<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.460> robot<00:05:27.640> into<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> tank<00:05:28.390> of

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
you can drive the robot into a tank of

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.260 
you can drive the robot into a tank of
acetone<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.380> will<00:05:29.590> entirely<00:05:29.979> dissolve<00:05:30.610> except

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270

for the magnet there's also possible to

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.130 
for the magnet there's also possible to
make<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:33.790> structural<00:05:34.270> layer<00:05:34.479> of<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.810> robot

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
make the structural layer of the robot

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.960 
make the structural layer of the robot
out<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.350> a<00:05:35.650> material<00:05:36.160> that<00:05:36.310> dissolves<00:05:36.850> in

out of a material that dissolves in
water<00:05:37.000> making<00:05:37.990> the<00:05:38.110> entire<00:05:38.320> robot<00:05:38.890> dissolve

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250

water making the entire robot dissolve
in<00:05:39.400> water<00:05:39.430> is<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.850> bit<00:05:40.150> trickier<00:05:40.570> but<00:05:41.020> the

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
in water is a bit trickier but the

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.719 
in water is a bit trickier but the
researchers<00:05:41.440> seem<00:05:41.770> confident<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.550> it<00:05:42.700> will

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
researchers seem confident that it will

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.060 
researchers seem confident that it will
