00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.830
 Hello everyone, today I start to spend 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.849
 lesson because how to make a gun 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.190
 a paper revolver the basis of me 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.889
 I had to throw out because it did not work 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.419
 calculate exactly 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.909
 location of main parts inside 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:26.599
 revolver designed a new one had 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:28.729
 use cardboard too much 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 of course did not have to spend time and 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:35.320
 to fit everything 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.590
 you calculate so don't say the details 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:47.660
 lined and knew how to see that inside 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:51.790
 enclosures the location of the future details so 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:56.270
 this is all a draft 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.930
 We will finish as it burns dad was 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.540

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.280

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.630

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.600

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.789
 attach it there the main frame 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.609

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.130
 later on 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.899

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.639

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 optional trigger 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:50.640
 I had it here right here 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 so as they say everything is done manually 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 to the touch 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.460
