00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 at e3 in los angeles for one of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 last time 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.580
 we are happy to tell you that we are coming 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.559
 to find the car that will us 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 take to the airport to get in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 France but we will especially enjoy it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.359
 to speak of force to motor sport 6 the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 latest version of the simulation of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 motor racing that honors the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 xbox one 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.890
 we could almost say if they forced 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 a little bit the trait that this is the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 first simulation next gen time he 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.640
 we thought there was a jump 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.250
 graphic in terms of quality between the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.550
 5 and this one the cars are over 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.290
 realistic wolves also on the slopes 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.789
 this tobacconist decorates everything 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.739
 the environment in fact and smooth puree 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 and seems more responsive when we hit 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.649
 dvno they will valdinguer stole a little 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 further 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.510
 finally really stopped there was a little 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.430
 jump there was a noticeable jump between 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.739
 it was this episode this new episode and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.890
 the previous one we also had a big 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.040
 pleasure to discover three circuits a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.290
 night circuit a two-day circuit and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.390
 a circuit in the rain and it is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 important to note that there is a real 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.049
 true driving difference 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.189
 so obviously depending on 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.060
 cars but also according to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.400
 weather conditions 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 for example the puddles will tend 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.090
 to provoke aquaplaning when they 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 are a bit too important and it's 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.430
 to say we are going to lose the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.799
 control of his vehicle in a bend 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 or even sometimes in a straight line or 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700
 in any case to lose a little bit of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.439
 wandering speed and all that can 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 change the way you have to react 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.729
 so as not to lose his place so as not to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.670
 simply lose the race and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 finish in the side of the gravel 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.970
 there is also to one thing that is enough 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.420
 interesting is that there are new 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.939
 circuits that are rather rather 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.540
 really nice technique to practice 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.950
 obviously it will take them 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.630
 wait for the the already the gamescom in August 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.550
 and then we follow the paris games week for 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.440
 what more people can do 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.630
 to make an opinion on more new and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.460
 more content but one thing is sure 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.250
 is that this edition will be released in 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.729
 end of the year is rather a very good 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.800
 vintage a very good a very good vintage and that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.320
 fans of the series and those who 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600
 are looking for a car simulation that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.640
 can take beginners by the hand 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.070
 and give satisfaction to the experts so 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 these people will find their happiness 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.930
 with forza motorsport 6
