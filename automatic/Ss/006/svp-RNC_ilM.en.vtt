00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.979
 how are dear techno friends 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.569
 Today I am in the city 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.910
 of coquimbo had to travel for a 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.340
 event that I brought this pater and that is a 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.110
 attached battery let's say one more battery 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.480
 for iphone 4 it is presented as a 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.099
 normal case and serves to feed the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.630
 phone battery we are going to make them to 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.500
 review with knowing if this is worth it 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.910
 have it or not here in texcoco not not worth 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.759
 It's worth having the truth immediately 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.520
 I tell them exactly what it is about 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.829
 1200 milliamps counts this battery 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.290
 external and said in the external box to 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.940
 toilet and for iphone 4 or iphone 4s that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.010
 we have the instructions and the goods 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 inside the box is this case and a 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.300
 cable that we have behind the one that says 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.130
 aesthetically it is beautiful however 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.930
 meets a requirement a case leaves 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.730
 exposed the glass and if the cell phone 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.920
 it falls, it can break us all 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.260
 ways at the top we have a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.720
 entry for the lock or mutate button 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.310
 calls and a space for 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.840
 connection of our hearing aids to 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.329
 side we have cut out the space 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.550
 accurate for our matteo button and 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.960
 the volume buttons and here we have the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.060
 connector for the phone and these two 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.440
 audio outputs are very important 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.420
 because I've seen other reviews 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.370
 and some of these keys do not bring them 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.290
 they say it's very hard to listen without 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.660
 those holes here we have the entrance 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
 of the usb that unfortunately is not the usb 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.180
 common one more difficulty and here we have 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.940
 the power button of our battery 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.230
 keys is very simple to work very 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 simple to apply the phone is 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.770
 Remove to the top and insert 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.080
 the phone in this way then 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.810
 we put this plastic part again 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 and we are ready to work for 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.910
 load our battery keys connect 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.040
 this usb normal to our computer and 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.230
 the other small end we connect 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.840
 directly to the back of the 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.360
 case ih and we will have a charge without 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.730
 problems 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.380
 good doing one more review 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.330
 detailed on the back that does not 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.710
 we missed we have this button that we 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.720
 indicates through the lights as 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.070
 more products so loaded is in 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.630
 this case we have the four lights 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.060
 lit so the case is 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.100
 100% charged and this little window 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 to be able to take photos an advantage that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.479
 they have also cut out the space for 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.880
 the flash now we see in this image very 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.580
 bad the truth surprised us sony 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.080
 bloggie as it records in low light but 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.450
 good in the camera that had brought well 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.040
 that we insert the iphone4 and it connects 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.840
 immediately all the other images 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.270
 they saw were recorded with this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.120
 iphone 4s why the difference compared to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.390
 the same amount of light milestone there is 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.220
 put the battery keys we see how it is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.640
 exposed the video we also see that it is 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.930
 100% charged and we will bring the camera closer 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.890
 now you are not going to realize 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.390
 because it is out of focus 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 unfortunately the bloggie does not 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.640
 favors but I show them a 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.140
 small picture there is and we are going to light 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.580
 our case so that you notice the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.870
 difference and how it starts to load 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.330
 immediately we go down and see 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.260
 immediately the effect that produces thus 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.090
 that we already had 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.799
 keys is not a very good option without 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.390
 But it serves for some emergency 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.770
 you wonder how I made for 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.570
 record this video look 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.950
 with this I only want to show you 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.750
 that if you want to make videos if 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.820
 you want to show off for the world of 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.810
 youtube only have to feel like 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.430
 and you can look for the way 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.860
 product review today 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.630
 battery keys for iphone 4 in this case 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.430
 they say it's an external battery of 1900 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 and the truth is not very good the truth 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.290
 it helps us for what it says it does not achieve 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.750
 load 100% music 50 percent on the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.280
 iphone 4 battery if it could serve in 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.570
 case an emergency call or 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.060
 you will need to bring it particularly 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.100
 urgent we could use this battery 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 keys but is not very good and does not recover 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.480
