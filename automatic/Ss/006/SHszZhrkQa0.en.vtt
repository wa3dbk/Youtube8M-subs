to do a lipo charge lipo slash the
lithium<00:00:28.289> ion<00:00:28.529> charge<00:00:29.599> I've<00:00:30.599> got<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> hooked<00:00:31.019> up

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
lithium ion charge I've got it hooked up

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.350 
lithium ion charge I've got it hooked up
into<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.679> um<00:00:33.110> battery<00:00:34.110> holder<00:00:35.030> let's<00:00:36.030> do

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
into this um battery holder let's do

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.350 
into this um battery holder let's do
let's<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.469> amps<00:00:40.670> these<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.850> supposed<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
let's do two amps these are supposed to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
let's do two amps these are supposed to
be<00:00:42.420> thirty<00:00:42.780> four<00:00:43.050> hundred<00:00:43.079> million<00:00:43.920> power

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
be thirty four hundred million power

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:54.639 
be thirty four hundred million power
battery<00:00:45.230> side<00:00:46.230> 2h<00:00:46.800> 2<00:00:47.520> amps<00:00:48.410> should<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.590> okay

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.930 

see<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:55.770> kind<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> voltage<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.550> started

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
see what kind of voltage they started

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.779 
see what kind of voltage they started
out<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.210> 3.62<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.530> looks<00:00:58.710> like<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> that'll

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
out with 3.62 it looks like so that'll

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.660 
out with 3.62 it looks like so that'll
probably<00:01:02.820> take<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> while<00:01:04.159> alright<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
probably take a while alright so this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.190 
probably take a while alright so this
cell<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> charged<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> looks<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.110> were

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
cell is charged it looks like we were

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
cell is charged it looks like we were
able<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> add<00:01:09.170> just<00:01:10.170> under<00:01:10.650> 1,800<00:01:11.270> milliamps

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
able to add just under 1,800 milliamps

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.219 
able to add just under 1,800 milliamps
which<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:14.100> quite<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> bit<00:01:14.720> and<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
which is quite a bit and that was from I

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.810 
which is quite a bit and that was from I
think<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> started<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.189> three<00:01:17.460> point<00:01:17.670> six

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
think it started around three point six

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.660 
think it started around three point six
four<00:01:18.150> volts<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.070> let's<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> discharge

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
four volts so now let's do a discharge

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.870 
four volts so now let's do a discharge
test<00:01:23.420> there's<00:01:24.420> discharge<00:01:25.369> one<00:01:26.369> end<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
test there's discharge one end so I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.590 
test there's discharge one end so I
can't<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.180> any<00:01:27.360> higher

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can't go any higher

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.399 
can't go any higher
woo<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:29.509> there<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> can't<00:01:31.320> go

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
woo you know there we go so I can't go

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
woo you know there we go so I can't go
any<00:01:31.560> higher<00:01:31.590> than<00:01:31.770> one<00:01:32.130> amp<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:33.119> what

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
any higher than one amp so that's what

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.569 
any higher than one amp so that's what
we're<00:01:33.420> gonna<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.810> let's<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.170> started

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.690 

alright<00:01:41.579> we'll<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.850> back<00:01:43.070> okay<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.460> done

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
alright we'll be back okay so it's done

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.620 
alright we'll be back okay so it's done
discharging<00:01:46.070> after<00:01:47.070> quite<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> while<00:01:47.670> two

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
discharging after quite a while two

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.280 
discharging after quite a while two
hundred<00:01:48.930> seven<00:01:49.229> minutes<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.149> it's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
hundred seven minutes or so it's

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.420 
hundred seven minutes or so it's
discharged<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> three<00:01:52.920> volts<00:01:53.250> looks

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
discharged down to three volts looks

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.510 
discharged down to three volts looks
like<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:54.470> little<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> middle

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
like a little bit of right in the middle

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.080 
like a little bit of right in the middle
of<00:01:56.640> 3,200<00:01:57.540> milliamps<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.939> is<00:02:01.729> which<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.880> say

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
of 3,200 milliamps which is which I say

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.469 
of 3,200 milliamps which is which I say
what<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.350> line<00:02:04.850> with<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:06.360> I've

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
what is probably in line with what I've

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.940 
what is probably in line with what I've
been<00:02:06.600> seen<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> web

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
been seen on the web

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
been seen on the web
so<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.240> have<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.849> NCR<00:02:11.989> 18650

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
so there we have it there's a NCR 18650

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.280 
so there we have it there's a NCR 18650
from<00:02:13.230> Panasonic<00:02:14.750> discharged<00:02:15.750> down<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.050> three

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
from Panasonic discharged down to three

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
from Panasonic discharged down to three
volts<00:02:16.620> at<00:02:17.250> 1<00:02:18.209> amp<00:02:19.550> about<00:02:20.550> 3200<00:02:21.239> milliamps

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
volts at 1 amp about 3200 milliamps

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.230 
volts at 1 amp about 3200 milliamps
thanks
