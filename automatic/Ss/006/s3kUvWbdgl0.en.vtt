00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.559
 full list of materials and where the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.230
 I bought first let's take our 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.719
 pet bottles and with the help of a cutter 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 very carefully we are going to cut the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
 bottom part of the bottle too 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.960
 you can help with scissors for 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.770
 facilitate work 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.439
 Y 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.479
 let's repeat these steps with all 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.460
 the peta bottles in this way 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.070
 we are going to form the trays of the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.780
 organizer with all the bottles and 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.780
 this is the result 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.050
 now we are going to give another cut in the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.230
 trays but now a little further down 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.150
 this is so that they have a flower shape and 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.880
 let's re-cut for everything 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.120
 around this step is completely 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.120
 optional 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.960
 now to be able to pass the fish in the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.450
 threaded rod let's make a 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.549
 hole in the middle part 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 We will do this by heating the needle with 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.580
 the lighter very carefully and let's go 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.799
 to pass the hot needle on the pp for 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.990
 make the little hole and we repeat 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.869
 these steps with all the trays of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.160
 pedra then let's paint them with 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.739
 our spray paint 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.020
 I decided to paint them a green color 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.680
 turquoise but you can do it the color 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.989

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.209
 We place on the rod to ensure 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.209
