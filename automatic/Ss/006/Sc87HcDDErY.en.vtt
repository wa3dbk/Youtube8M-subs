00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.230
 hello classmates, well, I love you 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.460
 present 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.460
 a neck knife 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 the brave necker 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 with its cover here from c's 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.430
 that fits perfectly 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 you see that it is logically tiny 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 I do not know how much has exactly d 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.730
 long but good 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.199
 I steel is bought in 1227 by 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.890
 that most American brands 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.890
 cabaret etc 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.810
 the steels they use are carbon and 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.280
 for me it's a disadvantage if it's a 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.870
 neck knife particularly that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.870
 sweated a lot no matter how much the cover of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.300
 Kleenex since he sweat a lot and transmits 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.010
 moisture and wear a good knife 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.980
 neck just stuck to the sweaty shirt 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.980
 and being carbon steel so good 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.270
 I'm wrong but 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.329
 but it was not what most 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.720
 I liked it and this one in particular because it is 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:31.290
 1227 steel like many Nordics 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.070
 how good river bar is empty 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.360
 concave 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.360
 and good will measure some 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.630
 6 centimeters of sheet or so is what the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.020
 made zipper fruit to support 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 the thumb 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.590
 you see what 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.990
 my hand is neither small nor big is a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.320
 medium term that comes to be a l of 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.320
 gloves 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.920
 the position is not forced from the finger 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.920
 thumb 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.140
 then he has the guard here 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 very secure 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.760
 -Barrio Bernays 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.620
 scanned 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.620
 usa 1227 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.950
 a subscriber has a red coating 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870
 rugged 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 moment as I did not used never 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.260
 I know how endure in 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.260
 beginning 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.079
 it is rough and holds that is to say to me and to you 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.129
 I tell me much gives me hands without 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.129
 However, it retains very well 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.240
 and good 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.370
 in the case as I say 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.260
 he has bleeding 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.349
 so that the moisture slips and falls down 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.990
 there it is perfectly coupled is fine 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.390
 made 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.360
 and well this cord was coupled to me 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.420
 and well let's try the vegetable 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.569
 to use him 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.040
 the stick that we used before 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.040
 with the gel 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.000
 just as wonderful 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.780
 this affects much more in the wood that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.380
 the gel 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.760
 I suppose it will be 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.760
 by the emptying that has 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.769
 in that aspect it is more incisive 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.769
 we'll see 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.219
 well here the bite of the 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.219
 famous beaver 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.850
 of course to do in which ions the 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.280
 wood is a wonder another thing is already 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.480
 for 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.480
 to peel and such 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.790
 if you have to be a long time peeling 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.790
 Well man I do not know now we'll see but 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.700
 and the kid something happens to him that is 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.700
 arriving 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.700
 and well then this in a jiffy 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.529
 very well let's think a little 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.950
 logically to be neck knife and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.080
 lack 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.280
 a mango 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.280
 powerful that we 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.949
 that comes our hand 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.949
 what man is to peel 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.470
 we do not do it as well as with a 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.640
 knife 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.640
 of the typical but 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:52.290
 but no 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.569
 the diameter the truth that very well all 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.559
 what is 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.529
 as well as for example with the fall level 1 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:05.759
 which is also neck but has 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:07.700
 a rubber handle and you can grab it 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.950
 best 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.630
 with that if you can wait in a way 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.630
 more comfortable with this not so much 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.650
 but as it regards influence 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.580
 timber 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.860
 I already say I think it will be by emptying 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.860
 very well you have already seen phenomenon 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.750
 Well, I'm telling you that leaves will be 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.530
 more or less like the blade of a knife 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.530
 normal and there 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.470
 not very comfortable 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.170
 the grip is good the only thing that does not 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.720
 it would be fine just like I put something to 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.330
 court for what 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.889
 to be something else and this is not 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.310
 so empty 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:52.370
 but good the feeling it gives is 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.670
 It's quality and good knife 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.670
 neck 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.900
 and good is an option 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.950
 so 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.229
 and let's try to see 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.430
 and 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:35.230
 dies in the love way of wood 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.230
 in a barbarous way 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.360
 how it hits you that many types of 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.529
 disks to the bank also like the bank and 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.339
 all 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:46.339
 it's very good 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.010
 Well, this is all that many 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.010
 thanks a greeting
