00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.379 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to
use<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.770> v-ray<00:00:08.160> renderer<00:00:08.640> and<00:00:08.760> how<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.059> set<00:00:09.360> up

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
use the v-ray renderer and how to set up

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.900 
use the v-ray renderer and how to set up
a<00:00:09.570> render<00:00:09.870> under<00:00:10.110> render<00:00:10.320> setup<00:00:10.710> so<00:00:11.430> first<00:00:11.700> go

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
a render under render setup so first go

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.410 
a render under render setup so first go
to<00:00:11.940> rendering<00:00:12.570> render<00:00:13.200> setup<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:15.180> first

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
to rendering render setup and the first

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.490 
to rendering render setup and the first
thing<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.660> want<00:00:15.840> to<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.020> sure<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
thing you want to make sure is that you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.440 
thing you want to make sure is that you
have<00:00:16.530> v-ray<00:00:16.980> setup<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> your<00:00:17.640> renderer<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.270> go

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
have v-ray setup is your renderer so go

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.900 
have v-ray setup is your renderer so go
to<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.720> common<00:00:19.110> tab<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.740> then<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.700> where<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to the common tab and then to where it

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.760 
to the common tab and then to where it
says<00:00:21.060> assign<00:00:21.390> renderer<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.110> under

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
says assign renderer and under

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.440 
says assign renderer and under
production<00:00:22.950> you<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> select<00:00:24.120> the<00:00:24.300> little

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
production you want to select the little

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.190 
production you want to select the little
Settings<00:00:24.870> button<00:00:25.050> hit<00:00:25.890> v-ray<00:00:26.340> advanced<00:00:27.200> ok

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
Settings button hit v-ray advanced ok

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.810 
Settings button hit v-ray advanced ok
and<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:29.010> should<00:00:29.220> make<00:00:29.400> sure<00:00:29.430> that<00:00:29.700> your

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and they should make sure that your

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.730 
and they should make sure that your
material<00:00:30.270> editor<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.660> also<00:00:31.080> v-ray<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.530> you

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
material editor is also v-ray so you

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990 
material editor is also v-ray so you
want<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.950> have<00:00:32.040> production<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> material

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
want to have production a material

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.360 
want to have production a material
editor<00:00:33.270> set<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.719> v-ray<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:35.010> next<00:00:35.250> thing

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
editor set up as v-ray the next thing

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.400 
editor set up as v-ray the next thing
you'll<00:00:35.520> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:36.749> sure<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.289> you're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you'll want to do is make sure if you're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.630 
you'll want to do is make sure if you're
rendering<00:00:37.589> a<00:00:37.800> single<00:00:38.129> frame<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.550> have

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
rendering a single frame they have

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
rendering a single frame they have
single<00:00:39.030> setup<00:00:39.410> that<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.499> have<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.820> view

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
single setup that you have the view

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.950 
single setup that you have the view
setup<00:00:42.179> so<00:00:42.329> that'll<00:00:42.510> render<00:00:42.749> the<00:00:42.870> entire

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
setup so that'll render the entire

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
setup so that'll render the entire
window<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> opposed<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> crop<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.820> will

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
window is opposed to crop which will

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.209 
window is opposed to crop which will
render<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.359> a<00:00:45.449> portion<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.989> window<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
render just a portion of the window you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.829 
render just a portion of the window you
also<00:00:47.370> want<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.609> change<00:00:47.850> your<00:00:47.940> output<00:00:48.120> size<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
also want to change your output size so

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:49.939 
also want to change your output size so
you<00:00:48.929> want<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.679> sure<00:00:49.710> your

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
you want you to make sure your

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.559 
you want you to make sure your
resolution<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.640> high<00:00:50.850> enough<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.329> when<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
resolution is high enough that when you

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.989 
resolution is high enough that when you
print<00:00:51.839> it<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.859> quality<00:00:53.309> will<00:00:53.429> still<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.850> there

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
print it the quality will still be there

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.689 
print it the quality will still be there
so<00:00:54.269> usually<00:00:55.069> you<00:00:56.069> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> somewhere

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so usually you want to be somewhere

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
so usually you want to be somewhere
around<00:00:56.850> 2000<00:00:57.719> 3000<00:00:58.379> but<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.589> should<00:00:58.769> really

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
around 2000 3000 but you should really

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.029 
around 2000 3000 but you should really
find<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.819> pixel<00:01:00.629> size<00:01:00.659> in<00:01:01.289> photoshop<00:01:01.829> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
find the pixel size in photoshop and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490 
find the pixel size in photoshop and
input<00:01:02.309> those<00:01:02.489> values<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> pixel

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
input those values here so this is pixel

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.340 
input those values here so this is pixel
dimension<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.129> inches<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.760> anything<00:01:06.350> next

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
dimension not inches or anything next

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
dimension not inches or anything next
you<00:01:07.620> want<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:09.860> under<00:01:10.860> v-ray

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you want to make sure that under v-ray

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.800 
you want to make sure that under v-ray
that<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.520> your<00:01:14.520> image<00:01:15.090> sampler<00:01:15.479> set<00:01:15.689> up

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that you have your image sampler set up

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.380 
that you have your image sampler set up
so<00:01:16.369> usually<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.520> by<00:01:17.729> default<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.299> on

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so usually out by default it's on

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.910 
so usually out by default it's on
adaptive<00:01:18.869> subdivision<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.500> usually<00:01:19.799> I'll

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
adaptive subdivision but usually I'll

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.889 
adaptive subdivision but usually I'll
set<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.219> adaptive<00:01:20.789> DMC<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> seems<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> be

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
set it to adaptive DMC it seems to be

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.529 
set it to adaptive DMC it seems to be
the<00:01:21.990> best<00:01:22.140> average<00:01:22.439> render<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:23.539> adaptive

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
the best average render or so adaptive

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.370 
the best average render or so adaptive
DMC<00:01:26.000> under<00:01:27.000> environment<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.229> sure

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
DMC under environment you can make sure

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
DMC under environment you can make sure
your<00:01:28.560> environment<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.310> reflections<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.030> on

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
your environment and reflections are on

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.020 
your environment and reflections are on
and<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.439> using<00:01:31.619> HDR<00:01:32.159> IMAP<00:01:32.640> you'd<00:01:32.850> want

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and if you're using HDR IMAP you'd want

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.899 
and if you're using HDR IMAP you'd want
to<00:01:33.090> plug<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:35.100> but

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to plug that map in here and here but

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
to plug that map in here and here but
for<00:01:36.149> now<00:01:36.210> we'll<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.539> leave<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.049> blank<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
for now we'll just leave them blank and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
for now we'll just leave them blank and
make<00:01:37.649> sure<00:01:37.799> they're<00:01:37.950> both<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
make sure they're both on and you can

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
make sure they're both on and you can
just<00:01:40.109> make<00:01:40.259> sure<00:01:40.439> these<00:01:40.560> other<00:01:40.770> things<00:01:41.039> are

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just make sure these other things are

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.929 
just make sure these other things are
all<00:01:41.399> set<00:01:42.170> according<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> their<00:01:43.409> defaults<00:01:43.979> next

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
all set according to their defaults next

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.069 
all set according to their defaults next
you<00:01:45.030> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> select<00:01:45.359> indirect<00:01:45.899> illumination

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you want to select indirect illumination

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.169 
you want to select indirect illumination
you<00:01:46.680> want<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> make<00:01:47.039> sure<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
you want to make sure this is on so this

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.319 
you want to make sure this is on so this
is<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> secondary<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.770> primary<00:01:50.310> balances<00:01:51.090> so

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
is the secondary and primary balances so

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630 
is the secondary and primary balances so
without<00:01:51.630> these<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.079> only<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.770> direct

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
without these you only have one direct

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.980 
without these you only have one direct
light<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> won't<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.719> first

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
light and you won't have the first

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.779 
light and you won't have the first
balance<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> primary<00:01:56.219> bounce<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
balance which is primary bounce in the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.090 
balance which is primary bounce in the
second<00:01:57.179> bounce<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.170> adds<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> sort<00:01:59.039> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
second bounce so this adds the sort of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.209 
second bounce so this adds the sort of
overall<00:02:00.590> ambient<00:02:01.590> lighting<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> essenes

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
overall ambient lighting to essenes

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.160 
overall ambient lighting to essenes
without<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> very<00:02:03.509> harsh<00:02:03.840> light

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
without this would be very harsh light

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.950 
without this would be very harsh light
so<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.189> general<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.909> default<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.390> radiance

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so in general the default is radiance

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.359 
so in general the default is radiance
and<00:02:07.140> map<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> set<00:02:08.100> mine<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and map I'm going to set mine to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.930 
and map I'm going to set mine to
irradiance<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> light<00:02:10.259> cache<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.850> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
irradiance and light cache it's just a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.809 
irradiance and light cache it's just a
faster<00:02:12.390> renderer<00:02:13.069> under<00:02:14.069> light<00:02:14.250> cache<00:02:14.519> I'll

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
faster renderer under light cache I'll

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.449 
faster renderer under light cache I'll
increase<00:02:15.090> my<00:02:15.150> subdivisions<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.080> 2500<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
increase my subdivisions to 2500 this

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.500 
increase my subdivisions to 2500 this
will<00:02:17.610> increase<00:02:17.909> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
will increase the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.210 
will increase the
just<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.989> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.620> also<00:02:19.769> increase

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
just a little bit you can also increase

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.089 
just a little bit you can also increase
the<00:02:20.640> sample<00:02:21.420> size<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.629> 0.01<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.799> you're<00:02:22.920> doing

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the sample size to 0.01 if you're doing

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.680 
the sample size to 0.01 if you're doing
a<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.400> high-quality<00:02:23.700> render<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
a really high-quality render you can

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.589 
a really high-quality render you can
change<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> point<00:02:25.470> zero<00:02:25.799> zero<00:02:25.860> five<00:02:26.599> but

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
change this to point zero zero five but

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.420 
change this to point zero zero five but
really<00:02:27.870> point<00:02:28.319> zero<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.709> seems<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.310> good

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
really point zero one seems to be good

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
really point zero one seems to be good
enough<00:02:29.670> I'll<00:02:30.239> also<00:02:30.420> click<00:02:30.690> show<00:02:31.019> calc<00:02:31.349> phase

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
enough I'll also click show calc phase

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.970 
enough I'll also click show calc phase
which<00:02:31.830> will<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.099> show<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.519> map<00:02:32.970> building

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
which will just show the map building

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.430 
which will just show the map building
under<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> radiance<00:02:35.400> map<00:02:35.840> hi<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.900> going<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.379> be

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
under a radiance map hi is going to be

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.759 
under a radiance map hi is going to be
pretty<00:02:37.650> high<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:39.260> initial<00:02:40.260> render<00:02:40.560> so

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
pretty high for a initial render so

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.039 
pretty high for a initial render so
usually<00:02:41.040> I'll<00:02:41.160> set<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.489> medium<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.269> render

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
usually I'll set this medium and render

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.930 
usually I'll set this medium and render
my<00:02:43.200> initial<00:02:43.590> passes<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.190> medium<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.849> then

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
my initial passes it medium and then

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
my initial passes it medium and then
when<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.090> want<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.360> render<00:02:45.569> my<00:02:45.690> final<00:02:46.170> rendering

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
when I want to render my final rendering

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
when I want to render my final rendering
I'll<00:02:46.709> switch<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.129> back<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.519> high<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.329> all

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
I'll switch this back to high but all

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.750 
I'll switch this back to high but all
the<00:02:48.510> default<00:02:48.870> settings<00:02:49.200> are<00:02:49.290> fine<00:02:49.610> again<00:02:50.610> I'll

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the default settings are fine again I'll

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
the default settings are fine again I'll
select<00:02:51.480> show<00:02:51.840> calc<00:02:52.140> phase<00:02:52.410> which<00:02:52.650> will<00:02:52.769> just

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
select show calc phase which will just

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.180 
select show calc phase which will just
show<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.250> map<00:02:53.459> being<00:02:53.879> built<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.739> that's<00:02:55.920> all

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
show the map being built and that's all

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.220 
show the map being built and that's all
for<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:57.510> menu<00:02:58.819> next<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.450> settings<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
for this menu next is the settings and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.690 
for this menu next is the settings and
this<00:03:01.470> shouldn't<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.799> much<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.190> need<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.489> change

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
this shouldn't be much we need to change

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.729 
this shouldn't be much we need to change
here<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.359> you<00:03:03.510> want<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.079> globally

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
here if you want to just globally

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.530 
here if you want to just globally
increase<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.280> quality<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.849> can<00:03:06.030> change<00:03:06.269> this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
increase the quality you can change this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.750 
increase the quality you can change this
global<00:03:07.319> subdivision<00:03:07.859> multiplier<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.640> right

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
global subdivision multiplier so right

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.089 
global subdivision multiplier so right
now<00:03:08.849> it's<00:03:08.970> at<00:03:09.060> one<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.599> select<00:03:10.140> two<00:03:10.379> it's

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
now it's at one if I select two it's

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.699 
now it's at one if I select two it's
going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.310> increase<00:03:12.019> everything<00:03:13.019> double<00:03:13.470> all

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
going to increase everything double all

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.440 
going to increase everything double all
my<00:03:14.099> settings<00:03:14.430> double<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.790> make<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.030> twice<00:03:15.390> as

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
my settings double so make it twice as

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.080 
my settings double so make it twice as
crisp<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.260> also<00:03:16.379> going<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.650> take

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
crisp but it's also going to take

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.069 
crisp but it's also going to take
exponentially<00:03:18.090> longer<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:18.690> usually<00:03:19.019> you

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
exponentially longer so usually you

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.930 
exponentially longer so usually you
don't<00:03:19.200> want<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> fuss<00:03:20.069> with<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.700> if<00:03:20.819> you

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
don't want to fuss with this but if you

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.449 
don't want to fuss with this but if you
want<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.620> really<00:03:22.620> make<00:03:22.739> everything<00:03:23.190> better

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
want to really make everything better

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.860 
want to really make everything better
you<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.849> increase<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:24.750> you're

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
you can increase this to but you're

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.839 
you can increase this to but you're
really<00:03:25.049> going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.319> quadruple<00:03:26.040> your<00:03:26.069> rendering

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
really going to quadruple your rendering

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.690 
really going to quadruple your rendering
time<00:03:27.090> under<00:03:28.049> render<00:03:28.260> elements<00:03:28.919> this<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.459> where

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
time under render elements this is where

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.509 
time under render elements this is where
you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.880> add<00:03:30.739> different<00:03:31.739> channels<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:32.430> you

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
you can add different channels so if you

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.699 
you can add different channels so if you
want<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.760> add<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.599> example<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.079> material<00:03:34.590> ID

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
want to add for example the material ID

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.800 
want to add for example the material ID
which<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.099> always<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.370> good<00:03:35.549> idea<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:36.720> will

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
which is always a good idea that will

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.800 
which is always a good idea that will
allow<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.950> select<00:03:38.459> numbers<00:03:39.450> for<00:03:39.720> each

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
allow you to select numbers for each

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.449 
allow you to select numbers for each
material<00:03:40.290> you're<00:03:40.440> using<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.889> if<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.069> open<00:03:41.190> up

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
material you're using so if you open up

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.089 
material you're using so if you open up
your<00:03:41.700> material<00:03:42.510> editor<00:03:42.709> each<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.919> these

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
your material editor each of these

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.309 
your material editor each of these
materials<00:03:44.639> has<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> number<00:03:45.359> assigned<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.109> so

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
materials has a number assigned to it so

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.170 
materials has a number assigned to it so
if<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.560> select<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.519> then<00:03:47.669> choose<00:03:48.150> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
if you select one and then choose a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.270 
if you select one and then choose a
number<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.870> choose<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.620> different<00:03:49.889> number<00:03:50.250> for

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
number and choose a different number for

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.000 
number and choose a different number for
each<00:03:50.549> material<00:03:51.440> those<00:03:52.440> materials<00:03:52.919> will

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
each material those materials will

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.319 
each material those materials will
render<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> separate<00:03:53.880> channel<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
render out as a separate channel that

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.780 
render out as a separate channel that
you<00:03:54.419> can<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:54.720> use<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.109> Photoshop<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:55.650> turn<00:03:56.639> on

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
you can then use in Photoshop to turn on

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.180 
you can then use in Photoshop to turn on
and<00:03:56.970> off<00:03:57.030> layers<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.290> crop<00:03:58.530> out<00:03:58.739> different

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
and off layers and crop out different

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.620 
and off layers and crop out different
materials<00:03:59.669> without<00:03:59.790> having<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.269> re<00:04:00.419> render

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
materials without having to re render

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.470 
materials without having to re render
everything<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.549> that's<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.849> basics<00:04:03.269> for

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
everything and so that's the basics for

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.560 
everything and so that's the basics for
render<00:04:03.750> setup<00:04:04.049> in<00:04:04.200> v-ray
