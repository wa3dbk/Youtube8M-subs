sometimes they don't work at all there

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.400 
sometimes they don't work at all there
are<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.180> few<00:01:49.420> things<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:49.960> do<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.230> make<00:01:50.380> it

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
are a few things you can do to make it

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.710 
are a few things you can do to make it
more<00:01:50.680> likely<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.250> achieve<00:01:51.580> these<00:01:51.730> medals<00:01:52.180> but

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
more likely to achieve these medals but

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.170 
more likely to achieve these medals but
trust<00:01:53.080> me<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.440> doesn't<00:01:53.740> always<00:01:54.010> work<00:01:54.180> clearly

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
trust me it doesn't always work clearly

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.090 
trust me it doesn't always work clearly
the<00:01:55.630> only<00:01:55.780> way<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.080> achieve<00:01:56.440> these<00:01:56.620> medals<00:01:56.980> is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
the only way to achieve these medals is

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.340 
the only way to achieve these medals is
by<00:01:57.280> dropping<00:01:57.850> some<00:01:58.090> sort<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.420> explosive<00:01:58.780> upon

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
by dropping some sort of explosive upon

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.290 
by dropping some sort of explosive upon
your<00:01:59.500> own<00:01:59.650> death<00:01:59.920> which<00:02:00.430> hopefully<00:02:00.730> will<00:02:01.090> blow

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
your own death which hopefully will blow

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.420 
your own death which hopefully will blow
up<00:02:01.420> your<00:02:01.540> enemy<00:02:01.840> while<00:02:02.140> you're<00:02:02.320> dead<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.220> the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
up your enemy while you're dead so the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.150 
up your enemy while you're dead so the
first<00:02:03.640> tip<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.420> must<00:02:04.630> always<00:02:04.990> watch<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
first tip you must always watch the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.369 
first tip you must always watch the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
killcam afterlife medals seem to be

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.680 
killcam afterlife medals seem to be
awarded<00:02:08.800> while<00:02:08.950> watching<00:02:09.190> these<00:02:09.489> killcams<00:02:10.060> it

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
awarded while watching these killcams it

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.240 
awarded while watching these killcams it
doesn't<00:02:11.080> seem<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.349> count<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:11.890> kill<00:02:12.099> them

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
doesn't seem to count if you kill them

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.729 
doesn't seem to count if you kill them
before<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.760> killcam<00:02:13.239> or<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.050> skip<00:02:14.469> the

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739

obtaining<00:02:16.749> these<00:02:17.200> medals<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.980> is<00:02:18.189> most

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
obtaining these medals this is most

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.350 
obtaining these medals this is most
likely<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.790> problem

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
likely a problem

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.240 
likely a problem
I<00:02:19.420> believe<00:02:20.050> how<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.350> works<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.770> anything

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
I believe how it works is that anything

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.270 
I believe how it works is that anything
you<00:02:21.400> leave<00:02:21.670> behind<00:02:21.880> including<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.810> grenade

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
you leave behind including a grenade

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.610 
you leave behind including a grenade
disappears<00:02:24.280> after<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.790> respawn<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:26.230> watching

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
disappears after you respawn so watching

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.650 
disappears after you respawn so watching
the<00:02:26.740> killcam<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:27.580> extends<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> time<00:02:28.510> of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
the killcam actually extends the time of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.930 
the killcam actually extends the time of
the<00:02:28.720> grenade<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.530> explosion<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.880> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the grenade and the explosion so you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.210 
the grenade and the explosion so you
need<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.210> quote<00:02:31.480> remain<00:02:32.080> dead<00:02:32.380> while<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.010> kill

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
need a quote remain dead while the kill

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.760 
need a quote remain dead while the kill
takes<00:02:33.520> place<00:02:33.820> if<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.900> instantly<00:02:35.440> respawn

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
takes place if you instantly respawn

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.770 
takes place if you instantly respawn

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
before the grenade goes off it will not

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.600 
before the grenade goes off it will not
count<00:02:38.670> okay<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:39.730> what<00:02:40.210> explosives<00:02:40.900> work<00:02:41.080> best

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610

as<00:03:07.090> mentioned<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.989> requires<00:03:08.410> cooking<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
as mentioned this requires cooking the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.910 
as mentioned this requires cooking the
grenade<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.360> be<00:03:10.510> risky<00:03:10.750> because<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.739> you

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
grenade this can be risky because if you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.620 
grenade this can be risky because if you
cook<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.280> for<00:03:12.430> too<00:03:12.580> long<00:03:12.610> you'll<00:03:13.390> blow

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
cook it for too long you'll blow

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.350 
cook it for too long you'll blow
yourself<00:03:14.050> up<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.489> conversely<00:03:15.489> if<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.120> cook

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
yourself up and conversely if you cook

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.510 
yourself up and conversely if you cook
it<00:03:16.480> for<00:03:16.630> too<00:03:16.810> short<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.680> enemy<00:03:18.070> will<00:03:18.280> be<00:03:18.310> able

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
it for too short the enemy will be able

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.090 
it for too short the enemy will be able
to<00:03:18.640> dodge<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.209> explosion<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.500> with<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.800> said

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
to dodge the explosion so with that said

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.190 
to dodge the explosion so with that said
I<00:03:21.340> recommend<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.090> semtex<00:03:22.360> grenade<00:03:22.900> for<00:03:23.050> this

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
I recommend the semtex grenade for this

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.410 
I recommend the semtex grenade for this
challenge<00:03:23.470> semtex<00:03:24.430> grenades<00:03:24.670> work<00:03:25.180> better

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
challenge semtex grenades work better

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.940 
challenge semtex grenades work better
because<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:25.959> essentially<00:03:26.410> cook<00:03:26.799> it

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
