the original Mad Max trilogy and

the original Mad Max trilogy and
obviously<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.250> as<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.760> say<00:00:51.910> Mel<00:00:52.660> Gibson's<00:00:52.960> was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
obviously is as you say Mel Gibson's was

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.350 
obviously is as you say Mel Gibson's was
rather<00:00:53.320> defining<00:00:53.920> back<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.700> character<00:00:55.149> so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
rather defining back on a character so

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.110 
rather defining back on a character so
there's<00:00:56.020> no<00:00:56.320> point<00:00:56.710> in<00:00:56.980> trying<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.730> step<00:00:58.000> into

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
there's no point in trying to step into

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.510 
there's no point in trying to step into
summer<00:00:58.329> shoes<00:00:58.630> or<00:00:58.840> fill<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.440> void<00:00:59.710> or<00:01:00.010> try<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.309> do

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
summer shoes or fill a void or try to do

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.790 
summer shoes or fill a void or try to do
something<00:01:00.730> better<00:01:01.030> than<00:01:01.210> or<00:01:01.630> create<00:01:02.020> or<00:01:02.260> know

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
something better than or create or know

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.389 
something better than or create or know
that<00:01:02.829> whatsoever

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
that whatsoever

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.419 
that whatsoever
I<00:01:03.550> think<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:03.940> saving<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:05.609> practical<00:01:08.399> side<00:01:09.399> to

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
I think the saving and practical side to

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:12.359 
I think the saving and practical side to
that<00:01:10.030> for<00:01:10.630> appeasing<00:01:11.259> any<00:01:11.439> essence<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.130> trying

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
that for appeasing any essence of trying

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.209 
that for appeasing any essence of trying
to<00:01:12.639> lie<00:01:13.539> be<00:01:13.749> have<00:01:13.960> an<00:01:14.079> ego<00:01:14.469> in<00:01:14.710> try<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.009> new

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
to lie be have an ego in try a new

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.739 
to lie be have an ego in try a new
better<00:01:15.460> alternatives<00:01:15.999> I<00:01:16.030> mean<00:01:16.149> it's<00:01:16.600> about

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
better alternatives I mean it's about

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.359 
better alternatives I mean it's about
the<00:01:16.869> George<00:01:17.079> Miller<00:01:17.289> created<00:01:17.770> Mad<00:01:17.950> Max<00:01:18.219> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the the Intel for where the character

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.640 
the the Intel for where the character
was<00:02:11.209> at<00:02:11.450> any<00:02:11.569> given<00:02:11.780> moment<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.260> any<00:02:12.380> given

scene so we work closely in that respect
and<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.170> course<00:02:15.380> trying<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:16.840> not<00:02:17.840> let<00:02:17.959> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
and of course trying to not let the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.870 
and of course trying to not let the
audience<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.830> see<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.160> switch<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.700> when

audience in and see the switch and when

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.690 
audience in and see the switch and when
when<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.420> was<00:02:20.510> Tom<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:20.989> was<00:02:21.080> myself<00:02:21.230> and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
when it was Tom when it was myself and

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.160 
when it was Tom when it was myself and
of<00:02:22.700> course<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.030> film's<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.959> playing

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
I think you've been before Tom with

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.160 
I think you've been before Tom with
lawless<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.330> what<00:02:29.510> does<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.630> mean<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.140> a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
