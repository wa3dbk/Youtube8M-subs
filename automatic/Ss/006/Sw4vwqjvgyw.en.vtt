00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.210
 4 guys today blades sur venes a pokemon 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 of the week this time who has won 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.290
 I liked jitmol and it was clear the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.150
 last week he was about to take 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.680
 the victory and this is has also led 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.210
 I have to say that for very little 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.910
 won sanamein but good we go 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 catching lee what but of all guys is 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.550
 a little introduced the first 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.140
 generation of the ancients of the ancients 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.570
 of those who want it with much much 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 more love than sometimes to other pokemon and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 it is one of the three evolved forms 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.750
 of shooting and it's together with simon chan and in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
 bike you know that to evolve affirmed 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.380
 ntx before must have more defense to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.790
 evolve football and should have more 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 attack and it will evolve towards an amount 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.719
 he has to have attack and defense in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 these in equal parts his name 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 comes from the words hit hit in 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.200
 English and monde monster 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 and read thanks to the honor and it's done 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.460
 obviously the well-known actor fighter of 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.129
 martial arts and teacher of 10 when 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.180
 bruce lee is a bit of fight guy and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 let's go with your guys skills 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.910
 flexibility skills immunity to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 the paralysis this stability to more 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 from one to look like a little 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.890
 useless or a little in that it does not work 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.240
 skills of the most important to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.760
 a weaver physics that can not 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.340
 stop is worth your second skill is bold 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 who sees their power increased from all 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.770
 the movements that cause damage to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.910
 kick as kick assault by 20% 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.430
 interesting and with the skill 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.560
 hidden for me is the best quotes that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 you can put physical but also light 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.300
 We've already talked about it and it's 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.430
 that doubles increases the increase of 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.990
 speed one hundred percent if the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.479
 pokemon consumes the object that carries 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.460
 equipped how can we make you consume 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 objects thanks to a fence or a gem 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 that this generation does not exist but 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.550
 before this hand but you know a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.310
 fence we can make it spend that 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.800
 object and he can or with a grass object 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.229
 the object is unique and you have imagined that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.630
 we put a two-turn attack to jen 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.910
 mol and I would do it in a turn and already 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.410
 we would be that object and they gave 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.580
 multiply the speed by a hundred 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.710
 one hundred worth 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 we go to football stadiums and they are 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.450
 life ps 50 attack 120 what you have to 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 have a physical lewis one of those things 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.350
 fundamentals are the attack obviously 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.960
 defense 53 very short in defense 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.520
 I watch a fast and 87 I have to say 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.070
 that to be a wii physics but it's not 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.540
 that is very fast is what what 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.610
 it fails a little let's leave liquid is 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.070
 fast or if you say it's quick but there 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.570
 physics the wipers that surpass them and 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.730
 because the best does not abound so much 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.310
 we are going with your special attacks attack now 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.480
 has 35 nothing we do not want at all 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.610
 as if I had 10 is not absolutely 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.590
 equal special defense 110 this does 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.300
 well, what do we have in mind without 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.040
 Moli because a defense of 110 in a 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.170
 little more than fight type is the truth is 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.310
 that is a bit weird is like 0 that 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.130
 tamÃ©n has a lot of defense eta is worth 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.510
 special devesa 110 pretty enough 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 high ballistic along with its attack and 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.620
 speed is nothing else until that 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.560
 'hat trick' of stats let's go guys now 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.150
 with the mobile sets that I have thought 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 for agile moli I think they are the most 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.450
 most convenient the core of all 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.760
 guys we're going to petar with the first one 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.340
 it is with flexibility the commune 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.239
 Immune paralysis firm nature 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 eps 252 in attack 205 2 in speed and 6 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.970
 in ps the object obviously we put 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.510
 life sphere we will increase 30 points of 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.070
 year all your attacks are all worth it and now 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.860
 we go with the four attacks that I 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.300
 would put together with this set that is ultra 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.700
 fist he learns with egg movement 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.950
 thanks to lemon chan kick super high 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 or point-blank one of those three like 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.390
 fight type attack then we would put rock 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.180
 sharp to cover earthquake flyers 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.110
 and igneous kick for plants to bugs 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.709
 etc 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.900
 this is would be his four attacks 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.630
 fundamental for this set with life 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.250
 sphere the strategy of this set is 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.050
 leave and burst before dying with 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.690
 physical attacks that cover countless 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.970
 types and with flexibility not if you're not 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.350
 thanks to that ability they can not 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.150
 stop the wave turn if we put them in 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.650
 compromis is constitutionally that 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.030
 is one let's put more leader that is used 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.340
 commitment and the only thing it does is 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.470
 reflex shift thanks to this we can 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.610
 take out gedemol and that we can not can not 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.230
 paralyze 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.050
 and now let's go guys with their second 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.900
 mobile set that is with the libya skill 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.870
 do not hide it, we do not put skill 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.359
 libya do not sign this I do not have is in 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.700
 attack 252 in speeds is in ps the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.190
 same as the same as before object 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.860
 go to citron with the low life heals 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.630
 and we would already be the objects would be activated 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.430
 the light ability we have the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.680
 We 100% ability and faster 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.290
 because pokemon the field is something that we 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.450
 will paralyze with the other is no longer valid 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.510
 we had flexibility we had light and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.640
 now the attacks would be ultra fist fist 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.770
 increase for is super high oa 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.210
 point-blank one of those four I've 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.460
 bet by fist we increase it seems 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.260
 this an increase after an attack 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.540
 sharp rock avalanche of the most liked 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.790
 risk as a precision and that gives 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.580
 more life and secure more accurately and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.230
 remove less life earthquake and kick 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.400
 india for de ignia is an attack that does not 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.200
 they are expected to learn more than the cic in 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.330
 gall and it's very good because it covers us 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.460
 spikes the plants is an attack that does not 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.500
 is contracted as the fire type and more with 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.450
 a physical attack that has to moli is 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.460
 quite dangerous it's worth and now we're going to 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.830
 strategy of these of this mobile set 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.020
 that hidden ability of jilin can 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.280
 afford 100% speed when losing the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.169
 object that it has equipped and the rival does not 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.880
 he finds out he will not find out since 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.160
 no warning message appears during 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.319
 the fight does not appear we do 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.530
 fist example increase we increase by 1 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.900
 our attack and then if they hit us already 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.569
 we are the fence heals life up 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.210
 the object we have 100% speed 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:41.520
 You can also put on if we like the fist 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.110
 increase can put ultra fist then 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.429
 there are also options like the bull that 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.139
 you can put it instead of the plug I'm going to 

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:47.789
 put corpulence instead of 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.309
 example igneous kick to increase 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.800
 earthquake you put it corpulence 80 is the 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.719
 attack and defense there are many more buses 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.740
 but I think these two that Moli is 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:59.969
 a whipple physics comes out and sticks clear 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.099
 then there are also others that in molÃ­ that 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.559
 it's not , I did not say it's the one 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:07.169
 backwards on the reverse the physical than what 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:09.240
 does is return the damage of an attack 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.959
 physical with endurance and then we can 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.610
 investment the we are stuck we take off 

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:15.930
 a lot of life we are left with we stayed 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.029
 with a life thank you endure and I'll 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.860
 we return with investment do not write 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.930
 by day yes or yes but I think it's a 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.300
 strategy to me it seems I do not like it 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.559
 I like more what the pokemon does 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.270
 what do you have to do that is if it 's kind of 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:28.769
 fight and is good at physical attacks that 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.449
 stick 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.610
 and that he cures us guys 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.499
 and then chose to take it I hope you 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.779
 you like guys these times of the 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:38.610
 week this is football and it's a pokemon to 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.409
 keep in mind I like it very much and I think 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.719
 that you trust in the we arrived guys with 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:46.979
 the next 5 pokemon that are ferro 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:49.020
 Gastro carr lion author acosta gift or 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.400
 cussler these the five that you have 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.159
 voted for a week of the week 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.469
 next to see who wins that the five 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.689
 they are very strange, but everything is 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:59.400
 a little more abundant not in the goal game 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.860
 but the other four did not know much 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.050
 more the boys arrived before 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.150
 say goodbye to special crusaders standing 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.550
 because geniuses of twitter one is kevin 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.909
 alexis then another so special greeting 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:17.389
 for baiuca game and so much state that by 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:17.389
 I really love your hairstyle guys
