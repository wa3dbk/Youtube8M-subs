00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:11.870
 Today is play as you know the current imac is 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:15.960
 Various input terminal is out I'm on the back side of the body Although this side is what 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:23.380
 So Toka usb memory say this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 When I tried to insert and remove the sd card, I looked into it from above 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:34.520
 It is necessary to insert and remove this . 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:38.450
 Seto- san also had the same trouble but only finally we have anchor usb hub and sd 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:44.570
 I think I was solved by buying a card reader 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 Mac system that I would say to be reading, everyone else a while ago it is and no iphone 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.300
 On the blog 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.570
 I bought immediately thought Jan This is called in these things had been introduced 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.740
 Those that have come from the manufacturer that the product names are going to Ina though I'm a little long 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:08.020
 It was about 2400 yen in the Amazon 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:08.020
 But I I'm telling the other the product names and cat illustration is all that let's out in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:20.510
 Yes I feel like this is pretty texture is very design- 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:26.680
 It feels like it's good, the content is really only this 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.810
 There are 3 ports of usb 3.0 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.940
 here 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:38.320
 There is a sd card reader 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:42.700
 The table is relatively short and quite thick and hard . It may be difficult to trimmer. 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:47.800
 I put this usb on a PC, but with such an adapter attached 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.930
 Such as to be in or with and refer to this android terminal Toka Well smartphone 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.360
 It has become a micro usb terminal 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.159
 Hmm 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.380
 I try to connect a little 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.840
 What do frequently of course this kind of mobile hard disk, which now looks like 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.439
 What to insert and remove 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.439
 Even if stabbed 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.830
 Standing 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.800
 It will be good 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.870
 Yes recognized 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.860
 Sd card to say this and then from here 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.860
 It does not mean 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:27.970
 Yes I also recognized this kind of sd card reader 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:31.920
 Whether knows about the client to further 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.920
 Though it is sound at the same time 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.680
 It recognizes as 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 Yes 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.340
 It seems that both can be used properly 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:50.230
 Now imac back side and sd card reader and it and it now - 3 sd 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.910
 I have inserted a card 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:59.330
 I'm aware of all this 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:04.850
 I wonder if it was good or not, I don't get into the back of things like this everyday use 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:08.280
 Is to say can be inserted and removed in your hand I thought I wonder if after all convenient 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:14.370
 If Well dare mention the shortcomings 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.250
 Overwintering usb port is facing upwards, so it is easy to get dust when not in use 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.640
 Or 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:27.070
 Then this cable is quite thick, so it may be difficult to manage 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.110
 After this length is very short, some people may say that there is no ant. 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.240
 May 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.420
 In for those who are using a laptop because it is this compactness and say which way or 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.410
 I think it's very good 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.770
 Well personally, the design is really cool too 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:51.880
 I think that I wonder if well look you in the imac 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:51.880
 So we were able to introduce us USB hub with Inatech's sd card reader
