Tripoli<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.450> don't<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:24.720> know<00:03:24.900> how<00:03:24.989> well<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
Tripoli I don't really know how well I

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.790 
Tripoli I don't really know how well I
think<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.520> looks<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:27.380> another<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.650> looks

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
think it looks I another think it looks

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.180 
think it looks I another think it looks
like<00:03:29.070> great<00:03:30.620> but<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.830> said<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.160> can

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
like great but like I said you can

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.370 
like great but like I said you can
replace<00:03:32.520> some<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.910> with<00:03:33.120> cyan<00:03:33.360> if<00:03:34.110> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
replace some of this with cyan if you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.110 
replace some of this with cyan if you
want<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.920> think<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.310> just<00:03:35.400> adds<00:03:35.610> way<00:03:36.060> too
