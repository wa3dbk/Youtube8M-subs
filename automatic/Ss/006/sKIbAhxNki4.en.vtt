00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240 
aluminum come to tell which at this time
seems<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> most<00:01:08.820> durable<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
seems to be the most durable and the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.420 
seems to be the most durable and the
best<00:01:11.520> choice<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.850> our<00:01:12.210> weather<00:01:12.450> conditions

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
best choice for our weather conditions

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
best choice for our weather conditions
could<00:01:14.430> make<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> painted<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> after

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
could make the painted here and after

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
could make the painted here and after
the<00:01:16.560> surface<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.700> includes<00:01:18.150> landing<00:01:18.990> them

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the surface that includes landing them

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.100 
the surface that includes landing them
down<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.670> then<00:01:20.670> covering<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:21.360> without<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
down and then covering them without a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.460 
down and then covering them without a
very<00:01:22.619> high-end<00:01:23.450> primer<00:01:24.450> bonder<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
very high-end primer bonder which is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.840 
very high-end primer bonder which is
almost<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> glue<00:01:27.770> is<00:01:28.770> 16<00:01:29.220> pounds<00:01:29.640> though

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
almost like a glue is 16 pounds though

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
almost like a glue is 16 pounds though
is<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.350> together

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is that when you put them all together

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
is that when you put them all together
it's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> huge<00:01:32.189> area<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.880> quite

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's a huge area so it's quite

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.530 
it's a huge area so it's quite
intimidating<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.380> begin<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
intimidating to begin and so I had to

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.850 
intimidating to begin and so I had to
launch<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.079> some<00:01:40.229> point<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.680> was

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
launch into it at some point and I was

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.780 
launch into it at some point and I was
August<00:01:41.250> eleventh<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.750> year<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
August eleventh of this year that I

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.859 
August eleventh of this year that I
began<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> project<00:01:45.149> knowing<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
began the project knowing that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
began the project knowing that
everything<00:01:46.619> had<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.130> done<00:01:47.369> by<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> mounted

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
everything had to be done by and mounted

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.200 
everything had to be done by and mounted
and<00:01:49.170> ready<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.649> go<00:01:49.850> prepared<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> ribbon

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and ready to go prepared for the ribbon

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.420 
and ready to go prepared for the ribbon
cutting<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.810> November<00:01:52.530> 11<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> had<00:01:53.100> three

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
cutting on November 11 so I had three

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
cutting on November 11 so I had three
months<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> complete<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.930> these<00:01:55.320> paintings

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
months to complete all these paintings

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
months to complete all these paintings
and<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.340> delivered<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.030> them

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and get them delivered and get them

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
and get them delivered and get them
mounted<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> wall

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
mounted on the wall

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
mounted on the wall
it's<00:01:59.280> hard<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.700> getting<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.510> into<00:02:00.690> it

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's hard to get getting right into it

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.290 
it's hard to get getting right into it
so<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> found<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.220> best<00:02:02.460> approach<00:02:02.820> was

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
so I found the the best approach was

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.240 
so I found the the best approach was
justly<00:02:03.720> grab<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.110> large<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.620> paintbrush<00:02:05.010> as

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
justly grab as large a paintbrush as

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.040 
justly grab as large a paintbrush as
possible<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.940> just<00:02:06.030> stick<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.720> can<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
possible and just stick it in a can of

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.859 
possible and just stick it in a can of
paint<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.500> slap<00:02:07.800> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.039> pinkest<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:09.479> much

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
paint just slap on the pinkest as much

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.020 
paint just slap on the pinkest as much
as<00:02:10.050> i<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.229> adjust<00:02:10.530> cover<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.009> huge<00:02:11.340> area<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
as i can adjust cover a huge area and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.610 
as i can adjust cover a huge area and
