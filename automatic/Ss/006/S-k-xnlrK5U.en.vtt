00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.150 

the<00:00:04.230> great<00:00:04.440> thing<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.650> working<00:00:05.130> with

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the great thing about working with

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.340 
the great thing about working with
subdivisions<00:00:05.790> in<00:00:05.910> modo<00:00:06.150> aside<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.200> adding

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
subdivisions in modo aside from adding

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.110 
subdivisions in modo aside from adding
detail<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.309> also<00:00:08.550> deform<00:00:08.910> our

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
detail is that we can also deform our

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.549 
detail is that we can also deform our
objects<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.750> some<00:00:09.929> really<00:00:10.410> cool

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
objects and have some really cool

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.830 
objects and have some really cool
interesting<00:00:11.160> shapes<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.240> what<00:00:12.450> I'm<00:00:12.540> gonna<00:00:12.630> do

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
interesting shapes so what I'm gonna do

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900 
interesting shapes so what I'm gonna do
here<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.170> use<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> column<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.549> from<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
here is use the column one from the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.810 
here is use the column one from the
previous<00:00:15.179> video<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.310> before<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.640> anything

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
previous video and before I do anything

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.720 
previous video and before I do anything
else<00:00:17.940> I'm<00:00:18.119> gonna<00:00:18.240> save<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.980> column<00:00:20.460> two

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
else I'm gonna save this as column two

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.109 
else I'm gonna save this as column two
and<00:00:21.650> that<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> won't<00:00:23.160> override<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:24.029> I've

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
and that way I won't override what I've

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.660 
and that way I won't override what I've
already<00:00:24.359> done<00:00:24.769> these<00:00:25.769> new<00:00:26.010> changes<00:00:26.250> how<00:00:26.640> we

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
already done these new changes how we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.220 
already done these new changes how we
deform<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.570> actually<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
deform this will actually be in a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.109 
deform this will actually be in a
separate<00:00:28.560> model<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.460> what<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.699> gonna<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.970> now

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
separate model so what I'm gonna do now

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.609 
separate model so what I'm gonna do now
is<00:00:30.300> come<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.050> I'm<00:00:31.140> gonna<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
is come in here and I'm gonna go up to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
is come in here and I'm gonna go up to
the<00:00:31.740> top<00:00:32.059> first<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the top first thing I want to do is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.220 
the top first thing I want to do is
taper<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:35.219> inlets<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:37.079> way<00:00:37.170> I'm

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
taper in these inlets and the way I'm

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.270 
taper in these inlets and the way I'm
going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:37.860> sure<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.190> an

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
going to do that is make sure I'm an

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340 
going to do that is make sure I'm an
edge<00:00:38.460> mode<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.719> double<00:00:40.200> click

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
edge mode and I'm gonna double click

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
edge mode and I'm gonna double click
each<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.100> these<00:00:41.219> loops<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.149> hold<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
each of these loops and I'm gonna hold a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.740 
each of these loops and I'm gonna hold a
shift<00:00:42.570> key<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> add<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.260> selection<00:00:44.750> I'm

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
shift key to add to my selection I'm

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.350 
shift key to add to my selection I'm
gonna<00:00:46.530> hold<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> alt<00:00:47.160> option<00:00:47.550> key<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.120> rotate

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
gonna hold the alt option key to rotate

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
gonna hold the alt option key to rotate
around<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.840> hold<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> shift<00:00:49.440> key<00:00:49.649> again<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
around and hold the shift key again and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
around and hold the shift key again and
just<00:00:51.149> make<00:00:51.570> sure<00:00:51.600> each<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.410> loops

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
just make sure each one of these loops

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.920 
just make sure each one of these loops
is<00:00:52.860> selected<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.940> accidentally<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.750> some

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is selected if you accidentally get some

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.410 
is selected if you accidentally get some
edges<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.430> selected<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
edges that you don't want selected just

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.090 
edges that you don't want selected just
hold<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> ctrl<00:00:58.230> key<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> click<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.980> on

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
hold the ctrl key and click right on

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.310 
hold the ctrl key and click right on
them<00:00:59.309> then<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.390> press<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.600> scale<00:01:01.109> command

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
them then if I press the scale command

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
them then if I press the scale command
you<00:01:01.980> would<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.730> might<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you would think that might do what you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.649 
you would think that might do what you
want<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.799> quite<00:01:05.129> suzune<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.180> form<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
want but not quite suzune to form it a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.230 
want but not quite suzune to form it a
little<00:01:06.810> bit<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.640> sides<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.939> still

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
little bit and these sides are still

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
little bit and these sides are still
just<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.810> thick<00:01:10.140> they're<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.799> pulled<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
just as thick they're just pulled in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
just as thick they're just pulled in
that's<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that's not what I want I want them to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.170 
that's not what I want I want them to
taper<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:14.220> instead<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.700> doing<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:14.939> one

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
taper in well instead of doing that one

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
taper in well instead of doing that one
at<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> time<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.080> very<00:01:16.259> simply<00:01:16.590> come<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> my

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
at a time I can very simply come to my

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.179 
at a time I can very simply come to my
action<00:01:17.369> centers<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.909> choose<00:01:18.450> local<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> what

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
action centers and choose local and what

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.539 
action centers and choose local and what
that<00:01:20.369> allows<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> do<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:22.100> scale<00:01:23.100> them<00:01:23.369> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that allows me to do is scale them in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.020 
that allows me to do is scale them in
and<00:01:23.790> they'll<00:01:24.780> work<00:01:24.990> independently<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.030> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and they'll work independently and so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
and they'll work independently and so
now<00:01:27.180> I've<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.540> flattened<00:01:28.080> out<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.439> end<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now I've just flattened out that end and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310 
now I've just flattened out that end and
if<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.640> turn<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:29.970> action<00:01:30.329> center<00:01:30.570> off<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.200> by

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
if I turn my action center off just by

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
if I turn my action center off just by
clicking<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.799> local<00:01:31.979> again<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> uncheck<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
clicking on local again to uncheck it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.179 
clicking on local again to uncheck it
and<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:34.530> scale<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.549> whole<00:01:35.880> group<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:37.159> now<00:01:38.159> I

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and I scale this whole group in now I

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
and I scale this whole group in now I
get<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> look<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.939> want<00:01:39.210> which<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
get the look that I want which is a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.490 
get the look that I want which is a
tapered<00:01:40.470> bevel<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.259> I'll<00:01:43.259> turn

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
tapered bevel all the way in I'll turn

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.880 
tapered bevel all the way in I'll turn
off<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:44.780> scale<00:01:45.780> tool<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.350> click<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> blank

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
off my scale tool and I'll click a blank

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
off my scale tool and I'll click a blank
area<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> deselect<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.020> notice<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
area to deselect and notice that it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670 
area to deselect and notice that it
looks<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.909> we've<00:01:51.570> only<00:01:51.780> subdivided

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
looks really good we've only subdivided

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.800 
looks really good we've only subdivided
this<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> level<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.579> two<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this to a level of two down here in the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
this to a level of two down here in the
item<00:01:55.079> properties<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.670> actually

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
item properties so I'm gonna actually

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.630 
item properties so I'm gonna actually
change<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> four<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.460> how

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
change that to four and you can see how

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179 
change that to four and you can see how
much<00:01:59.790> cleaner<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.360> smoother<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
much cleaner and smoother this is and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.350 
much cleaner and smoother this is and
remember<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> previous<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.329> we

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
remember in the previous video we

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
remember in the previous video we
actually<00:02:03.630> weighted<00:02:04.320> these<00:02:04.469> edges<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.759> they

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
actually weighted these edges but they

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
actually weighted these edges but they
picks<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.240> subdivisions<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.380> get

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
picks our subdivisions and so now we get

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.520 
picks our subdivisions and so now we get
a<00:02:07.619> nice<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.280> clean<00:02:08.550> molded<00:02:09.209> shape<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
a nice very clean molded shape so it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.229 
a nice very clean molded shape so it
looks<00:02:10.679> good<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.000> time

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
looks good let's do this one more time

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.010 
looks good let's do this one more time
and<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.349> press<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.680> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
just to sharpen that out and create some

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.370 
just to sharpen that out and create some
unique<00:03:23.620> shapes<00:03:24.240> so<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.540> choice<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.930> yours<00:03:25.959> but

unique shapes so the choice is yours but
we<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> very<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.520> nice<00:03:27.730> geometric<00:03:28.630> shape

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
we have a very very nice geometric shape

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.720 
we have a very very nice geometric shape
to<00:03:28.990> work<00:03:29.170> with<00:03:29.380> it's<00:03:29.860> not<00:03:30.040> overly<00:03:30.400> built

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
to work with it's not overly built

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.180 
to work with it's not overly built
there's<00:03:31.510> enough<00:03:31.840> edges<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.500> enough<00:03:32.680> polygons

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
there's enough edges and enough polygons

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.820 
there's enough edges and enough polygons
that<00:03:33.310> create<00:03:33.610> some<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:34.030> fine<00:03:34.480> details<00:03:34.990> so

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
that create some really fine details so

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.710 
that create some really fine details so
work<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.640> play<00:03:37.150> around<00:03:37.300> with<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> and

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
work with that play around with it and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.570 
work with that play around with it and
have<00:03:37.810> some<00:03:37.959> fun<00:03:37.990> with<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.320> but<00:03:38.890> for<00:03:39.070> now<00:03:39.100> let's

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
have some fun with it but for now let's

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.190 
have some fun with it but for now let's
create<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.970> rest<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.270> our<00:03:40.390> column<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.170> our

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
create the rest of our column for our

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.310 
create the rest of our column for our
banister<00:03:41.800> we've<00:03:42.700> got<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.030> shape<00:03:43.240> we<00:03:43.390> want<00:03:43.540> I'm

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
banister we've got the shape we want I'm

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.290 
banister we've got the shape we want I'm
gonna<00:03:44.500> save<00:03:44.770> this<00:03:44.920> one<00:03:45.160> more<00:03:45.340> time<00:03:45.550> before<00:03:46.060> I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
gonna save this one more time before I

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.170 
gonna save this one more time before I
deform<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.780> again<00:03:47.020> and<00:03:47.380> I'll<00:03:47.560> do<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> save<00:03:47.980> as

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
deform it again and I'll do a save as

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.470 
deform it again and I'll do a save as
column<00:03:49.180> 3<00:03:50.010> these<00:03:51.010> files<00:03:51.340> are<00:03:51.550> very<00:03:51.580> very<00:03:52.120> small

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
column 3 these files are very very small

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.110 
column 3 these files are very very small
so<00:03:52.900> it's<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.500> really<00:03:53.800> good<00:03:53.920> idea<00:03:54.160> just<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.490> keep

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so it's a really good idea just to keep

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.370 
so it's a really good idea just to keep
in<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.360> habit<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.720> saving<00:03:55.959> different

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
in the habit of saving different

tools we have for this one I'm going to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.550 
tools we have for this one I'm going to
choose<00:04:03.280> twist<00:04:03.760> now<00:04:04.510> when<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.660> activate<00:04:04.959> this

you<00:04:05.770> might<00:04:05.920> think<00:04:06.100> there's<00:04:06.490> a<00:04:06.580> lot<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.880> tools

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
you might think there's a lot of tools

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.150 
you might think there's a lot of tools
there<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.570> lot<00:04:07.959> of<00:04:08.080> people<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.320> know<00:04:08.500> kind<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:08.890> get

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
there a lot of people I know kind of get

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.560 
there a lot of people I know kind of get
freaked<00:04:09.400> out<00:04:09.490> with<00:04:09.670> all<00:04:09.790> these<00:04:09.940> commands<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
freaked out with all these commands and

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.390 
freaked out with all these commands and
all<00:04:10.660> these<00:04:10.810> handles<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:11.860> really<00:04:12.130> very

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
all these handles but it's really very

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.550 
all these handles but it's really very
simple<00:04:12.700> once<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.120> take<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.540> look<00:04:13.690> at<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:14.020> I'm

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
simple once you take a look at it I'm

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.990 
simple once you take a look at it I'm
going<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.739> open<00:04:14.860> up<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> properties<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:15.850> pull

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
going to open up the properties and pull

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
going to open up the properties and pull
those<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.180> just<00:04:16.390> like<00:04:16.750> that

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
those up just like that

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.979 
those up just like that
well<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:18.070> want<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.400> action<00:04:18.910> axis<00:04:19.540> to<00:04:19.690> be<00:04:19.810> on

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
well we want the action axis to be on

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.159 
well we want the action axis to be on
the<00:04:20.380> Y<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.919> want<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.250> actually<00:04:21.549> twist<00:04:21.790> this<00:04:22.180> so

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
the Y we want to actually twist this so

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.409 
the Y we want to actually twist this so
we're<00:04:23.350> changing<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.950> Y<00:04:24.180> we're<00:04:25.180> not<00:04:25.300> going

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
we're changing that to Y we're not going

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.880 
we're changing that to Y we're not going
to<00:04:25.479> use<00:04:25.570> any<00:04:25.720> snapping<00:04:26.290> at<00:04:26.380> this<00:04:26.530> point<00:04:26.800> so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
to use any snapping at this point so

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.810 
to use any snapping at this point so
we'll<00:04:26.979> close<00:04:27.220> that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
we'll close that

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.150 
we'll close that
and<00:04:28.450> then<00:04:28.960> you'll<00:04:29.080> see<00:04:29.290> this<00:04:29.470> handle<00:04:29.890> here<00:04:30.070> at

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
and then you'll see this handle here at

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.070 
and then you'll see this handle here at
the<00:04:30.250> bottom<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.760> at<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.000> top<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.450> if<00:04:31.990> you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
the bottom and at the top and if you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080 
the bottom and at the top and if you
look<00:04:32.260> closely<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.830> I'll<00:04:32.920> zoom<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.700> top<00:04:33.910> is

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
look closely and I'll zoom in the top is

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.720 
look closely and I'll zoom in the top is
very<00:04:34.360> narrow<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.500> bottom<00:04:35.920> is<00:04:36.040> very<00:04:36.130> thick

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
very narrow and the bottom is very thick

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.390 
very narrow and the bottom is very thick
and<00:04:37.120> what<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.780> means<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.740> tool<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
and what that means is this tool the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.460 
and what that means is this tool the
twist<00:04:39.700> tool<00:04:39.940> will<00:04:40.600> have<00:04:40.810> more<00:04:41.110> influence

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
twist tool will have more influence

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.380 
twist tool will have more influence
where<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:42.160> tool<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.580> thick<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.090> less

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
where that tool is thick and less

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.380 
where that tool is thick and less
influenced<00:04:44.020> where<00:04:44.230> it's<00:04:44.350> not<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.550> let<00:04:46.090> me<00:04:46.180> just

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
influenced where it's not so let me just

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.870 
influenced where it's not so let me just
click<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.990> drag<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.460> actually<00:04:48.610> see

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
click and drag this you can actually see

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.600 
click and drag this you can actually see
the<00:04:49.000> degrees<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:49.420> there<00:04:49.810> or<00:04:50.470> very<00:04:51.130> simply<00:04:51.550> you

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
the degrees in there or very simply you

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.760 
the degrees in there or very simply you
can<00:04:51.730> come<00:04:51.910> into<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.300> angle<00:04:52.690> itself<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.470> type

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
can come into the angle itself and type

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.180 
can come into the angle itself and type
in<00:04:53.980> exactly<00:04:54.850> what<00:04:55.030> you<00:04:55.060> want<00:04:55.180> 180<00:04:55.810> degrees<00:04:56.230> but

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
in exactly what you want 180 degrees but

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.430 
in exactly what you want 180 degrees but
if<00:04:57.580> I<00:04:57.850> wanted<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.360> use<00:04:58.540> these<00:04:58.690> handles<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.260> can

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
if I wanted to use these handles I can

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.670 
if I wanted to use these handles I can
do<00:04:59.530> two<00:04:59.710> things<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:00.160> can<00:05:00.340> hit<00:05:00.460> reverse<00:05:01.680> which

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
do two things I can hit reverse which

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.500 
do two things I can hit reverse which
twists<00:05:03.190> more<00:05:03.580> at<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.730> top<00:05:03.910> and<00:05:04.150> less<00:05:04.270> at<00:05:04.420> the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
twists more at the top and less at the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.780 
twists more at the top and less at the
bottom<00:05:04.920> doesn't<00:05:05.920> make<00:05:06.010> much<00:05:06.310> difference<00:05:06.340> for

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
bottom doesn't make much difference for

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.150 
bottom doesn't make much difference for
this<00:05:06.910> model<00:05:07.210> very<00:05:07.480> similar<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.770> how<00:05:08.890> we<00:05:08.950> use

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
this model very similar to how we use

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.370 
this model very similar to how we use
the<00:05:09.310> bend<00:05:09.550> tool<00:05:09.730> earlier<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.390> then<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.140> can

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
the bend tool earlier and then I can

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.860 
the bend tool earlier and then I can
actually<00:05:11.860> move<00:05:12.250> this<00:05:12.490> handle<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:13.750> would

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
actually move this handle and it would

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.010 
actually move this handle and it would
not<00:05:14.020> affect<00:05:14.500> beneath<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.490> at<00:05:15.610> all<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.930> would

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
not affect beneath it at all it would

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.460 
not affect beneath it at all it would
only<00:05:17.140> be<00:05:17.290> twisting<00:05:17.680> from<00:05:17.890> that<00:05:18.070> one<00:05:18.220> point

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
only be twisting from that one point

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.890 
only be twisting from that one point
which<00:05:20.470> really<00:05:20.980> adds<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.370> lot<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.580> cool<00:05:22.510> details

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
which really adds a lot of cool details

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.950 
which really adds a lot of cool details
to<00:05:23.110> your<00:05:23.230> shape<00:05:23.670> so<00:05:24.670> for<00:05:25.030> this<00:05:25.150> one<00:05:25.390> though<00:05:25.570> we

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
to your shape so for this one though we

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.050 
to your shape so for this one though we
do<00:05:26.140> want<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:26.470> twist<00:05:26.920> the<00:05:27.130> whole<00:05:27.310> thing<00:05:27.640> so<00:05:27.970> I'm

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
do want to twist the whole thing so I'm

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.440 
do want to twist the whole thing so I'm
gonna<00:05:28.150> bring<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.420> all<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.690> way<00:05:28.780> back<00:05:28.930> down

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
gonna bring this all the way back down

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.120 
gonna bring this all the way back down
and<00:05:31.450> that<00:05:32.140> will<00:05:32.260> turn<00:05:32.470> off<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.710> twist<00:05:32.950> tool

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
and that will turn off the twist tool

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.680 
and that will turn off the twist tool
and<00:05:33.510> we<00:05:34.510> have<00:05:34.750> our<00:05:35.020> column<00:05:36.300> I'm<00:05:37.300> going<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.510> zoom

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
and we have our column I'm going to zoom

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.210 
and we have our column I'm going to zoom
in<00:05:37.840> so<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.020> can<00:05:38.200> see<00:05:38.230> how<00:05:38.560> much<00:05:38.710> detail<00:05:39.070> we've

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
in so you can see how much detail we've

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.760 
in so you can see how much detail we've
created<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.390> just<00:05:40.630> by<00:05:40.750> creating<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.230> very<00:05:41.410> basic

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
created so just by creating a very basic

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.310 
created so just by creating a very basic
cylinder<00:05:42.360> beveling<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.480> edges<00:05:43.810> waiting

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
cylinder beveling the edges waiting

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.640 
cylinder beveling the edges waiting
using<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.760> scale<00:05:46.180> on<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.840> edges<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.320> the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
using the scale on the edges and the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.220 
using the scale on the edges and the
local<00:05:48.400> action<00:05:48.910> center<00:05:49.180> we've<00:05:49.720> created<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:50.200> very

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
local action center we've created a very

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.800 
local action center we've created a very
detailed<00:05:50.790> very<00:05:51.790> nice<00:05:52.000> column<00:05:52.420> that<00:05:52.540> we<00:05:52.660> can

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
detailed very nice column that we can

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.100 
detailed very nice column that we can
work<00:05:52.990> with<00:05:53.190> now<00:05:54.190> in<00:05:55.060> order<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.420> get<00:05:55.660> more

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
work with now in order to get more

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.830 
work with now in order to get more
detail<00:05:56.880> we<00:05:57.880> can<00:05:58.030> actually<00:05:58.180> go<00:05:58.420> ahead<00:05:58.450> and

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
detail we can actually go ahead and

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.690 
detail we can actually go ahead and
bevel<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.170> top<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.040> we'll<00:06:00.130> do<00:06:00.250> one<00:06:00.490> more

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
bevel the top so we'll do one more

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.400 
bevel the top so we'll do one more
detail<00:06:01.650> I'm<00:06:02.650> gonna<00:06:02.860> take<00:06:03.100> this<00:06:03.280> top<00:06:03.700> polygon

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.990 

and<00:06:08.410> I<00:06:08.530> want<00:06:08.710> to<00:06:08.770> bevel<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.190> but<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.790> don't

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
and I want to bevel this but I don't

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.750 
and I want to bevel this but I don't
want<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.300> do<00:06:10.390> a<00:06:10.420> simple<00:06:10.690> bevel<00:06:11.520> we're<00:06:12.520> gonna<00:06:12.610> do

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
want to do a simple bevel we're gonna do

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.700 
want to do a simple bevel we're gonna do
something<00:06:12.940> a<00:06:13.030> little<00:06:13.210> more<00:06:13.240> complex<00:06:13.720> and<00:06:14.050> I'm

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
something a little more complex and I'm

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.230 
something a little more complex and I'm
also<00:06:14.860> going<00:06:15.040> to<00:06:15.100> come<00:06:15.310> back<00:06:15.520> here<00:06:15.790> very

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
also going to come back here very

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.940 
also going to come back here very
quickly<00:06:16.510> and<00:06:16.780> change<00:06:16.930> my<00:06:17.110> subdivision<00:06:17.380> back

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
quickly and change my subdivision back

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.250 
quickly and change my subdivision back
down<00:06:18.160> to<00:06:18.310> level<00:06:18.550> two<00:06:18.820> and<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.870> reason<00:06:20.170> I'm

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
down to level two and the reason I'm

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.050 
down to level two and the reason I'm
doing<00:06:20.380> that<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.800> because<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:21.190> can<00:06:21.520> sense<00:06:21.940> that

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
doing that is because I can sense that

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.000 
doing that is because I can sense that
my<00:06:22.330> computer<00:06:22.750> is<00:06:22.810> starting<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.350> slow<00:06:23.980> down

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
my computer is starting to slow down

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.710 
my computer is starting to slow down
just<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.430> little<00:06:24.460> bit<00:06:24.790> as<00:06:24.970> we're<00:06:25.420> adding<00:06:25.630> more

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
just a little bit as we're adding more

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.410 
just a little bit as we're adding more
detail<00:06:26.140> and<00:06:26.320> twisting<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:27.400> what<00:06:28.300> the

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
detail and twisting and what the

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.730 
detail and twisting and what the
subdivisions<00:06:28.960> are<00:06:29.020> doing<00:06:29.230> remember<00:06:29.560> it's

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
subdivisions are doing remember it's

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.710 
subdivisions are doing remember it's
subdividing<00:06:30.280> every<00:06:30.550> polygon<00:06:30.910> in<00:06:31.120> here<00:06:31.330> by

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
subdividing every polygon in here by

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.410 
subdividing every polygon in here by
this<00:06:31.780> amount<00:06:32.310> so<00:06:33.310> the<00:06:33.490> less<00:06:33.700> amount<00:06:33.940> I<00:06:34.180> have

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
this amount so the less amount I have

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.600 
this amount so the less amount I have
you<00:06:34.870> can<00:06:34.990> even<00:06:35.140> change<00:06:35.350> this<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.710> zero<00:06:35.980> you'll

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
you can even change this to zero you'll

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.730 
you can even change this to zero you'll
see<00:06:36.790> a<00:06:36.820> very<00:06:36.970> chunky<00:06:37.240> model<00:06:37.720> and<00:06:37.870> that's<00:06:38.470> also

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
see a very chunky model and that's also

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.620 
see a very chunky model and that's also
the<00:06:38.919> advantage<00:06:39.340> of<00:06:39.490> subdivisions<00:06:40.030> is<00:06:40.180> that

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
the advantage of subdivisions is that

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.510 
the advantage of subdivisions is that
you<00:06:40.840> can<00:06:40.990> work<00:06:41.260> on<00:06:41.500> a<00:06:41.680> very<00:06:41.890> very<00:06:42.130> simple<00:06:42.490> model

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
you can work on a very very simple model

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.610 
you can work on a very very simple model
and<00:06:43.210> when<00:06:43.330> you're<00:06:43.420> ready<00:06:43.570> to<00:06:43.690> go<00:06:43.810> up<00:06:44.050> that<00:06:44.320> for

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
and when you're ready to go up that for

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.680 
and when you're ready to go up that for
your<00:06:44.740> render<00:06:45.040> so<00:06:45.970> in<00:06:46.060> this<00:06:46.150> case<00:06:46.360> we'll<00:06:46.570> just

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
your render so in this case we'll just

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.090 
your render so in this case we'll just
keep<00:06:46.810> it<00:06:46.900> at<00:06:47.050> 2<00:06:47.230> so<00:06:47.410> you<00:06:47.500> can<00:06:47.650> see<00:06:47.830> what<00:06:47.980> we're

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
keep it at 2 so you can see what we're

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.660 
keep it at 2 so you can see what we're
doing<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.690> with<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.990> bevel<00:06:50.200> before<00:06:51.160> I<00:06:51.430> pull

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670 
doing and with the bevel before I pull

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.910 
doing and with the bevel before I pull
this<00:06:51.820> up<00:06:52.060> we're<00:06:52.780> gonna<00:06:52.870> come<00:06:53.080> all<00:06:53.320> the<00:06:53.650> way<00:06:53.740> up

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
this up we're gonna come all the way up

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.080 
this up we're gonna come all the way up
and<00:06:54.100> look<00:06:54.310> what's<00:06:54.490> down<00:06:54.640> here

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
and look what's down here

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.940 
and look what's down here
there's<00:06:55.270> something<00:06:55.570> called<00:06:55.690> Profiles<00:06:56.320> and

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
there's something called Profiles and

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.580 
there's something called Profiles and
you<00:06:57.790> can<00:06:57.940> pop<00:06:58.390> this<00:06:58.570> up<00:06:58.750> if<00:06:58.900> you<00:06:58.930> want<00:06:59.170> and<00:06:59.380> look

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
you can pop this up if you want and look

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.680 
you can pop this up if you want and look
at<00:06:59.740> the<00:06:59.950> different<00:07:00.700> options<00:07:00.820> for<00:07:01.240> door<00:07:01.510> edges

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
at the different options for door edges

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
quite a few in there but if I choose a

quite a few in there but if I choose a
profile<00:07:07.540> what<00:07:08.140> that<00:07:08.380> will<00:07:08.590> allow<00:07:08.770> me<00:07:08.920> to<00:07:08.950> do

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.340 
profile what that will allow me to do
and<00:07:09.340> I'll<00:07:09.430> just<00:07:09.550> choose<00:07:09.730> one<00:07:09.940> of<00:07:09.970> these<00:07:10.320> when<00:07:11.320> I

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
and I'll just choose one of these when I

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.290 
and I'll just choose one of these when I
click<00:07:11.770> to<00:07:12.040> bevel<00:07:12.400> watch<00:07:12.610> what<00:07:12.820> happens<00:07:13.120> when<00:07:13.270> I

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
click to bevel watch what happens when I

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.260 
click to bevel watch what happens when I
pull<00:07:13.540> the<00:07:13.630> shift<00:07:14.070> it<00:07:15.070> actually<00:07:15.460> bevels<00:07:15.910> based

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
pull the shift it actually bevels based

pull the shift it actually bevels based
on<00:07:16.570> this<00:07:16.870> shape<00:07:18.060> I'm<00:07:19.060> going<00:07:19.120> to<00:07:19.300> undo<00:07:19.540> a<00:07:19.570> couple

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
on this shape I'm going to undo a couple

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.220 
on this shape I'm going to undo a couple
of<00:07:19.990> times<00:07:20.200> and<00:07:20.500> choose<00:07:21.190> another<00:07:21.430> one<00:07:22.110> click<00:07:23.110> to

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
of times and choose another one click to

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.790 
of times and choose another one click to
activate<00:07:23.410> the<00:07:23.740> bevel<00:07:24.810> it<00:07:25.810> creates<00:07:26.200> all<00:07:26.440> these

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
activate the bevel it creates all these

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.290 
activate the bevel it creates all these
different<00:07:27.190> profiles<00:07:28.050> for<00:07:29.050> that<00:07:29.230> bevel<00:07:29.530> and

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
different profiles for that bevel and

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.520 
different profiles for that bevel and
those<00:07:31.300> ship<00:07:31.630> with<00:07:31.780> modo<00:07:31.990> so<00:07:32.260> those<00:07:32.410> are

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:32.530 
those ship with modo so those are

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.840 
those ship with modo so those are
installed<00:07:32.860> when<00:07:33.010> you<00:07:33.040> install<00:07:33.130> your<00:07:33.520> program

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:33.850 
installed when you install your program

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.850 
installed when you install your program
so<00:07:34.540> by<00:07:34.660> starting<00:07:34.930> with<00:07:35.080> a<00:07:35.170> simple<00:07:35.560> cylinder

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
so by starting with a simple cylinder

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.090 
so by starting with a simple cylinder
waiting<00:07:36.760> the<00:07:36.850> edges<00:07:37.240> beveling<00:07:38.200> using<00:07:38.890> some

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.100 
waiting the edges beveling using some

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.100 
waiting the edges beveling using some
selection<00:07:39.580> sets<00:07:39.790> tapering<00:07:40.510> the<00:07:40.660> ends<00:07:40.960> with

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110 
selection sets tapering the ends with

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.050 
selection sets tapering the ends with
the<00:07:41.200> local<00:07:41.530> action<00:07:41.860> center<00:07:42.190> and<00:07:42.370> then

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.060 
the local action center and then

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.660 
the local action center and then
applying<00:07:43.390> a<00:07:43.570> deform<00:07:44.050> of<00:07:44.290> twist<00:07:44.770> we've

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:45.670 
applying a deform of twist we've

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.580 
applying a deform of twist we've
actually<00:07:45.880> created<00:07:46.180> a<00:07:46.480> very<00:07:46.750> nice<00:07:47.020> unique

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590 
actually created a very nice unique

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.680 
actually created a very nice unique
object<00:07:48.070> that<00:07:48.460> we<00:07:48.580> can<00:07:48.700> then<00:07:48.820> build<00:07:49.060> into<00:07:49.480> a

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:49.690 
object that we can then build into a

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.440 
object that we can then build into a
larger<00:07:50.230> mesh
