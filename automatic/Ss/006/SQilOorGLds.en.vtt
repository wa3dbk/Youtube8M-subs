challenging a lot of our preconceptions

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.620 
challenging a lot of our preconceptions
about<00:00:16.080> robots<00:00:16.619> there's<00:00:17.550> quite<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> source<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
about robots there's quite a source of

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.390 
about robots there's quite a source of
press<00:00:18.869> about<00:00:19.140> robots<00:00:19.619> we've<00:00:19.800> been<00:00:19.949> imagining

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
press about robots we've been imagining

press about robots we've been imagining
robots<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.119> our<00:00:21.240> lives<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> number<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
robots in our lives for a number of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.859 
robots in our lives for a number of
years<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:23.250> are<00:00:23.400> really<00:00:23.670> not<00:00:23.880> yet<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
years these are really not yet to

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
years these are really not yet to
materialize<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:26.099> any<00:00:26.250> meaningful<00:00:26.519> form<00:00:27.029> we

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
materialize in any meaningful form we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.179 
materialize in any meaningful form we
have<00:00:27.300> vacuum<00:00:28.080> cleaner<00:00:28.320> robots<00:00:28.769> that's<00:00:28.980> about

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
have vacuum cleaner robots that's about

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.500 
have vacuum cleaner robots that's about
as<00:00:29.310> good<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.609> gets<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.330> very

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
as good as it gets it's very very

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
as good as it gets it's very very
different<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:30.929> we<00:00:31.199> imagined<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.340> what

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
different to what we imagined so what

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
different to what we imagined so what
we've<00:00:32.700> done<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.059> sort<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.750> analyzed<00:00:34.110> why<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
we've done is sort of analyzed why that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.200 
we've done is sort of analyzed why that
might<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.280> pitched<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.760> series<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
might be and pitched this series of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
might be and pitched this series of
robots<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.989> challenge<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.739> question<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
robots to really challenge to question a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.720 
robots to really challenge to question a
lot<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.360> stereotype<00:00:39.989> ideas<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.489> initially

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lot of stereotype ideas and we initially

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
lot of stereotype ideas and we initially
started<00:00:43.129> interacting<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.550> Bristol

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
started interacting with Bristol

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.380 
started interacting with Bristol
robotics<00:00:45.420> lab<00:00:45.629> who<00:00:45.870> were<00:00:46.160> developing

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
robotics lab who were developing

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.700 
robotics lab who were developing
microbial<00:00:48.390> fuel<00:00:48.600> cell<00:00:48.930> powered<00:00:49.289> robots

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
microbial fuel cell powered robots

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.319 
microbial fuel cell powered robots
that'sthat's<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> device<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> turns

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that'sthat's the device that turns

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.900 
that'sthat's the device that turns
organic<00:00:51.809> matter<00:00:52.020> into<00:00:52.770> electrical<00:00:53.219> energy<00:00:53.370> we

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
organic matter into electrical energy we

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.479 
organic matter into electrical energy we
started<00:00:54.300> exploring<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> idea<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
started exploring the idea of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
started exploring the idea of the
carnivorous<00:00:56.789> side<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.899> get

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
carnivorous side of them how they get

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
carnivorous side of them how they get
afraid<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.710> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.039> things<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.430> might

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
afraid what kind of things they might

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
afraid what kind of things they might
eat<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> turning<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.100> form<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
eat and turning that into a form of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
eat and turning that into a form of
entertainment<00:01:02.719> but<00:01:03.719> also<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.409> wanted

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
entertainment but also we really wanted

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
entertainment but also we really wanted
the<00:01:04.860> objects<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.540> fit<00:01:06.540> into<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> home<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the objects to fit into the home so the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
the objects to fit into the home so the
aesthetics<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.520> very<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
aesthetics are very very different the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
aesthetics are very very different the
way<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.479> look<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.170> operate<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
way they look the way they operate the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
way they look the way they operate the
way<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.100> interact<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.729> very<00:01:12.000> different

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
way we interact with them very different

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
way we interact with them very different
the<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> wall<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> fly

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the one on the wall here is the fly

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.480 
the one on the wall here is the fly
paper<00:01:14.549> robotic<00:01:15.210> flock<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.369> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
paper robotic flock what we have here is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
paper robotic flock what we have here is
a<00:01:17.520> belt<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.960> white<00:01:19.170> beans<00:01:19.439> about<00:01:19.590> that's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
a belt the white beans about that's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.310 
a belt the white beans about that's
covered<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.340> honey<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.570> operates<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.140> like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
covered in honey so operates just like

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
covered in honey so operates just like
standard<00:01:22.799> fly<00:01:23.009> paper<00:01:23.250> flies<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.600> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
standard fly paper flies would be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
standard fly paper flies would be
attracted<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> honey<00:01:25.650> they'd<00:01:25.920> land<00:01:26.130> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
attracted to that honey they'd land on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.270 
attracted to that honey they'd land on
the<00:01:26.430> belt<00:01:26.780> get<00:01:27.780> stuck<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.130> it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the belt get stuck as you can see it's

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
the belt get stuck as you can see it's
moving<00:01:29.549> down<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.780> slowly<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
moving down but very very slowly and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
moving down but very very slowly and
right<00:01:32.340> underneath<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> blade

that<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> become<00:01:36.720> stuck<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> honey<00:01:37.590> they

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that have become stuck to the honey they

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
that have become stuck to the honey they
fall<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> microbial<00:01:39.600> fuel<00:01:39.780> cell

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
fall into the microbial fuel cell

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
fall into the microbial fuel cell
underneath<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> device<00:01:41.490> that
