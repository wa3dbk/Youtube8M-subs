00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
super super strong it was real real

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
suspension I mean the only time that it

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.460 
suspension I mean the only time that it
worked<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.670> me<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.000> when<00:02:07.510> that<00:02:07.690> when<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.259> road

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
worked for me is when that when the road

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.360
