00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.810
 and then let's wait for it to open 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.280
 Well, I just watched the forum open 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.830
 and then he tells me that I can not use it 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.410
 until I update what would be my 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.410
 photos and well then actually I have a 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.830
 lots of photos here in the forum 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.860
 Well, if I do, it would take me 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.560
 more or less with about two or three hours in 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.760
 that are updated so well then for 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.460
 avoid this mess but we will see it 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.240
 it came out so well then let's see what 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.780
 of command as it would be what you get here 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.740
 is motionless let's see what is in 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.400
 the first view of the site in boston that 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.650
 they are just completely there are good mobile and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.800
 is already opening what will be mobile 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.160
 and then at first glance we see that 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.520
 he changed a lot 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.160
 I mean that welcomes us 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.440
 let's continue 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:07.690
 who do want the new design and already 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:12.970
 they give us to share movies fast 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:16.020
 and trailers 22 themes to create movies 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.020
 in hd 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.160
 et cetera so let's start 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:33.190
 It may be later and good as since 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:37.870
 we have would not be what it would be there is mobile 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:41.950
 the 2013 version that they returned to 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:46.120
 Polish to throw and well then now as 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.530
 we already saw is perfectly ordered that 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.200
 we have the library that we have the 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.620
 cinema opacity here we can import here 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.500
 we can create a new 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.199
 library here we can improve the 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.470
 videos here we can adjust here 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.449
 we can look for the same as we can 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.479
 import things and we have all the 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.699
 events that we have and well then very 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.610
 complete this application and it 's 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:16.070
 perfectly ordered now let's see 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:19.080
 how is what would be expensive already going 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:23.400
 Well, you can say that it will take 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.919
 a little more than 93 more minutes and for 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.970
 well actually I had seen this 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.740
 application and changes several things like that 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.919
 Well, I'm going to omit filing 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.979
 because it's really going to be very 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.590
 long and well then well here I go to 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.900
