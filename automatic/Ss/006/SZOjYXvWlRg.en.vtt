Hero 4 microphone let's plug this in and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.389 
Hero 4 microphone let's plug this in and
see<00:01:32.310> how<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.460> goes

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
see how it goes

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.889 
see how it goes
with<00:01:36.399> this<00:01:36.610> see<00:01:37.000> if<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.149> can<00:01:37.329> notice<00:01:37.659> any

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
with this see if you can notice any

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.620 
with this see if you can notice any
difference<00:01:38.409> with<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> sound<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.450> can

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
difference with the sound you can

I'm touching the camera and those of you
with<00:01:46.479> GoPros<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.430> I'm<00:01:49.180> approximately

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
with GoPros know that I'm approximately

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.870 
with GoPros know that I'm approximately
at<00:01:50.979> an<00:01:51.219> arm's<00:01:51.579> length<00:01:51.960> okay<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.500> let's<00:01:54.009> get<00:01:54.729> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
at an arm's length okay so let's get the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.499 
at an arm's length okay so let's get the
other<00:01:55.000> one<00:01:55.290> attached<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.939> noticed<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:58.659> far

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
other one attached I have noticed so far

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.300 
other one attached I have noticed so far
so<00:02:01.509> I'm<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.630> look<00:02:01.899> just<00:02:02.380> plug<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.829> into<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.159> USB

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
so I'm a look just plug it into the USB

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:19.280 
so I'm a look just plug it into the USB
there

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.839 

now<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.349> last<00:02:20.590> clip<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.040> fast-forwarded

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
now the last clip we fast-forwarded

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.300 
now the last clip we fast-forwarded
because<00:02:22.270> there<00:02:22.569> was<00:02:22.660> no<00:02:22.810> sound<00:02:23.140> I've<00:02:23.470> stopped

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
because there was no sound I've stopped

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.229 
because there was no sound I've stopped
the<00:02:24.370> video<00:02:25.110> reattached<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.970> microphone<00:02:27.970> and

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
the video reattached the microphone and

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.320 
the video reattached the microphone and
this<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.620> next<00:02:30.040> test<00:02:30.280> how<00:02:30.700> does<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.120> sound

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
this is the next test how does it sound

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.650 
this is the next test how does it sound
if<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:32.110> hear<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> at<00:02:32.920> all<00:02:33.280> well<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
if you can hear it at all well if you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.050 
if you can hear it at all well if you
can't<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.140> won't<00:02:35.470> plate<00:02:35.769> which<00:02:36.459> means<00:02:36.730> this

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
can't I won't plate which means this

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.390 
can't I won't plate which means this
sentence<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.599> useless<00:02:38.019> unless<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:39.069> can<00:02:39.190> hear

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
sentence is useless unless you can hear

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.580 
sentence is useless unless you can hear
it<00:02:39.519> then<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.390> tell<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.930> sound<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.350> any

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
it then you can tell if the sound is any

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.890 
it then you can tell if the sound is any
different<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.459> for<00:02:42.790> comparison<00:02:43.180> sake<00:02:43.630> just

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
different just for comparison sake just

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
different just for comparison sake just
in<00:02:44.019> case<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.410> did<00:02:44.680> work<00:02:44.860> I'm<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.670> take

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
in case this did work I'm going to take

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.039 
in case this did work I'm going to take
the<00:02:46.330> microphone<00:02:46.660> out<00:02:46.930> now<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:49.049> continue

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
the microphone out now and continue

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.570 
the microphone out now and continue
talking<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.069> if<00:02:51.130> there's<00:02:51.370> any

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
talking so you can see if there's any

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.030 
talking so you can see if there's any
kind<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:52.000> difference<00:02:52.500> right<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.739> I've<00:02:53.830> played

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
kind of difference right so I've played

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.070 
kind of difference right so I've played
it<00:02:54.190> back<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.459> myself<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:55.000> I've<00:02:55.150> noticed<00:02:55.660> as

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
it back to myself and I've noticed as

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.960 
it back to myself and I've noticed as
you<00:02:56.260> guys<00:02:56.530> probably<00:02:56.860> have<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.340> marked

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
you guys probably have a marked

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.240 
you guys probably have a marked
difference<00:02:58.209> now<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.290> still<00:02:59.620> not<00:02:59.769> convinced

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
difference now I'm still not convinced

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.789 
difference now I'm still not convinced
by<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> reliability<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.569> somebody's<00:03:02.500> got<00:03:02.680> an

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
by the reliability if somebody's got an

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.699 
by the reliability if somebody's got an
idea<00:03:03.190> why<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.580> doesn't<00:03:03.819> always<00:03:04.150> work<00:03:04.530> let<00:03:05.530> me

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
idea why it doesn't always work let me

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.410 
idea why it doesn't always work let me
know<00:03:05.890> maybe<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.610> have<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.819> do<00:03:06.910> something<00:03:07.330> with

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
know maybe I have to do something with

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.850 
know maybe I have to do something with
the<00:03:07.540> connection<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.049> very<00:03:08.290> interested<00:03:08.830> to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
the connection I'm very interested to

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.699 
the connection I'm very interested to
hear<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> one<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:10.930> bought<00:03:11.230> it

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
hear but this is the one I bought it

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.800 
hear but this is the one I bought it
looks<00:03:12.010> like<00:03:12.220> it's<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.519> very<00:03:12.730> simple<00:03:13.030> lav

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
looks like it's a very simple lav

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.340 
looks like it's a very simple lav
microphone<00:03:15.060> apparently<00:03:16.060> it's<00:03:16.239> very<00:03:16.540> useful

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
microphone apparently it's very useful

and<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.859> read<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> recommendation<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.030> make<00:03:19.120> sure

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
and I read a recommendation to make sure

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.470 
and I read a recommendation to make sure
the<00:03:19.420> mics<00:03:19.600> as<00:03:19.750> close<00:03:19.959> as<00:03:20.170> possible

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the mics as close as possible
