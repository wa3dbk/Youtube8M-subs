00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
system to combat this first let's talk

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
system to combat this first let's talk
about<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> LFR<00:00:30.150> loop<00:00:30.449> works<00:00:30.720> right

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
about the way the LFR loop works right

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.870 
about the way the LFR loop works right
now<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.859> gonna<00:00:31.980> use<00:00:32.130> dragon<00:00:32.489> roast<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.790> an

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
now we're gonna use dragon roast as an

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
now we're gonna use dragon roast as an
example<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.750> rag<00:00:34.020> nose<00:00:34.200> isn't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
example and I know rag nose isn't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990 
example and I know rag nose isn't
possible<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:35.040> alafar<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.880> can't

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
possible in alafar but I really can't

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
possible in alafar but I really can't
draw<00:00:36.270> deathwing<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.899> deal<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.860> right

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
draw deathwing so deal with it so right

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
draw deathwing so deal with it so right
now<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.910> works<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> boss

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
now the way it works is that the boss

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
now the way it works is that the boss
dies<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> game<00:00:41.100> randomly<00:00:41.610> chooses

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
dies then the game randomly chooses

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
dies then the game randomly chooses
which<00:00:42.210> items<00:00:42.570> drop<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> bosses<00:00:43.680> loot
