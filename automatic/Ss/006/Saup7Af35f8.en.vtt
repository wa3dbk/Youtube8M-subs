flashbacks to Peters family history and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.990 
flashbacks to Peters family history and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
sense to me that they would go for

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.910 
sense to me that they would go for
someone<00:00:21.359> who<00:00:21.600> looks<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.199> Martin<00:00:22.590> Sheen

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.729 
and I'm still in the camp that he did
not<00:02:15.840> go<00:02:16.109> crazy<00:02:16.260> he<00:02:17.069> knew<00:02:17.189> exactly<00:02:18.620> he<00:02:19.620> knew

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
exactly what he was doing and he did it

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.989 
exactly what he was doing and he did it
for<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> reason<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.620> my<00:02:22.889> decision<00:02:23.099> stickin

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:23.999 
for a reason that's my decision stickin

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.699 
for a reason that's my decision stickin
to<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> think<00:02:24.540> he<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> great<00:02:25.170> actor<00:02:25.530> I

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
to it but I think he is a great actor I

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.319 
to it but I think he is a great actor I
think<00:02:25.920> we've<00:02:26.069> seen<00:02:26.310> him<00:02:26.519> do<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.999> of<00:02:27.030> really

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
think we've seen him do a lot of really

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.149 
think we've seen him do a lot of really
fun<00:02:27.510> things<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.109> think<00:02:28.349> he's<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:29.129> know

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
fun things I think he's you know

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.830 
fun things I think he's you know
somebody<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.969> would<00:02:30.239> bring<00:02:30.450> something<00:02:30.810> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
somebody that would bring something to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.979 
somebody that would bring something to
the<00:02:30.989> table<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.159> you<00:02:32.340> said<00:02:32.489> he's<00:02:32.760> his<00:02:33.719> dad

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
the table and like you said he's his dad

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.229 
the table and like you said he's his dad
is<00:02:34.319> there<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.950> why<00:02:35.129> not<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.579> casting<00:02:35.969> would<00:02:36.090> be

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
is there so why not the casting would be

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.580 
is there so why not the casting would be
perfect<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.989> would<00:02:37.109> make<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> lot<00:02:37.409> of<00:02:37.469> sense

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
perfect and it would make a lot of sense

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.099
