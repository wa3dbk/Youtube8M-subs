and you know a little bit mad it kind of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.880 
and you know a little bit mad it kind of
dry<00:01:35.939> looking<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.350> tossed<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
dry looking to me so I just I tossed it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.410 
dry looking to me so I just I tossed it
cuz<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> curly<00:01:38.579> wigs<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> keep

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
cuz of curly wigs I don't like to keep

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
cuz of curly wigs I don't like to keep
them<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.590> doesn't

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
them I think it's kind of like doesn't

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
them I think it's kind of like doesn't
make<00:01:41.520> sense<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.909> keep<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.180> curly<00:01:42.509> wig<00:01:42.689> once<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
make sense to keep a curly wig once it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
make sense to keep a curly wig once it
starts<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> rat<00:01:43.680> up<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:46.649> wig<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.700> very

gonna have a very very secure fit with
this<00:03:58.959> way<00:03:59.169> this<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.310> know<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.549> cap<00:04:00.729> is

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
this way this is you know the cap is

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.629 
this way this is you know the cap is
decent<00:04:01.530> now<00:04:02.530> as<00:04:02.650> far<00:04:02.829> as<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.159> parting<00:04:03.519> space

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
decent now as far as the parting space

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.059 
decent now as far as the parting space
on<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.359> is<00:04:04.629> it<00:04:04.959> doesn't<00:04:05.169> really<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.799> great

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
on it it is it doesn't really have great

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.129 
on it it is it doesn't really have great
parting<00:04:06.549> I<00:04:06.639> put<00:04:06.879> some<00:04:07.060> powder<00:04:07.269> in<00:04:07.419> here<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.989> try

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
parting I put some powder in here to try

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.289 
parting I put some powder in here to try
to<00:04:08.199> give<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.590> Scop<00:04:08.829> effect<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.430> would<00:04:10.000> say

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
to give it this Scop effect I would say

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.020 
to give it this Scop effect I would say
the<00:04:10.449> part<00:04:10.780> stops<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.560> lace<00:04:11.859> stops<00:04:12.310> about

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
the part stops the lace stops about

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.240 
the part stops the lace stops about
right<00:04:13.689> here<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.290> it's<00:04:14.500> probably<00:04:14.829> less<00:04:15.189> than

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
right here so it's probably less than

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.430 
right here so it's probably less than
half<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.729> an<00:04:15.879> inch<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.209> parting<00:04:16.599> space<00:04:16.720> and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
half of an inch of parting space and

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.479 
half of an inch of parting space and
then<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.519> has<00:04:18.729> like<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.090> skin<00:04:19.690> top<00:04:20.109> that's<00:04:21.070> right

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
then it has like a skin top that's right

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.159 
then it has like a skin top that's right

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.959

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
give it probably about maybe a little

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.390 
give it probably about maybe a little
bit<00:04:25.270> more<00:04:25.419> than<00:04:25.599> an<00:04:25.719> inch<00:04:26.050> if<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.919> use<00:04:27.219> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400

guys look how long this is I'm five two
and<00:05:56.500> this<00:05:57.460> reaches<00:05:58.060> down<00:05:58.389> to<00:05:58.960> my<00:05:59.110> bud<00:05:59.349> I<00:05:59.560> mean

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
and this reaches down to my bud I mean

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.149 
and this reaches down to my bud I mean
it<00:05:59.889> it<00:06:00.279> stops<00:06:00.759> literally<00:06:01.479> like<00:06:02.349> literally<00:06:02.979> in

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
it it stops literally like literally in

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.149 
it it stops literally like literally in
the<00:06:03.339> middle<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:04.180> my<00:06:04.569> but<00:06:04.779> it's<00:06:05.139> that<00:06:05.529> long<00:06:05.770> it's

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
the middle of my but it's that long it's

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.200 
the middle of my but it's that long it's
so<00:06:06.520> long<00:06:06.789> so<00:06:07.060> do<00:06:07.449> not<00:06:07.779> like<00:06:08.439> long<00:06:08.680> hair<00:06:09.210> don't

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
so long so do not like long hair don't

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.610 
so long so do not like long hair don't
even<00:06:10.599> think<00:06:10.779> about<00:06:10.870> getting<00:06:11.289> this<00:06:11.409> way

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
even think about getting this way

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.350 
even think about getting this way
because<00:06:11.949> it<00:06:12.099> is<00:06:12.129> just<00:06:12.490> it's<00:06:12.729> a<00:06:12.819> lot<00:06:13.029> of<00:06:13.060> hair

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
because it is just it's a lot of hair

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.409 
because it is just it's a lot of hair
it's<00:06:13.839> not<00:06:13.990> too<00:06:14.379> thick<00:06:14.800> as<00:06:15.009> you<00:06:15.159> can<00:06:15.339> see<00:06:15.639> it's

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
it's not too thick as you can see it's

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.290 
it's not too thick as you can see it's
not<00:06:16.659> too<00:06:16.960> thick<00:06:17.319> but<00:06:18.099> it's<00:06:18.430> it's<00:06:18.909> a<00:06:19.000> lot<00:06:19.270> of

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
not too thick but it's it's a lot of

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.149 
not too thick but it's it's a lot of
hair<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.599> deal<00:06:19.870> with<00:06:20.080> and<00:06:20.259> I<00:06:20.349> would<00:06:20.529> it<00:06:21.129> just

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
hair to deal with and I would it just

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:22.829 
hair to deal with and I would it just
doesn't<00:06:21.610> make<00:06:21.699> sense<00:06:21.759> to<00:06:22.089> buy<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.240> wig<00:06:22.509> this

00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:22.839 
doesn't make sense to buy a wig this

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.269 
doesn't make sense to buy a wig this
long<00:06:23.110> and<00:06:23.409> then<00:06:23.500> have<00:06:23.649> to<00:06:23.680> cut<00:06:23.949> it<00:06:24.039> because

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
long and then have to cut it because

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:25.860 
long and then have to cut it because
there's<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:24.669> many<00:06:24.849> options<00:06:25.120> out<00:06:25.569> there

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
there's so many options out there

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.139 
there's so many options out there
especially<00:06:26.289> with<00:06:26.620> synthetic<00:06:27.069> wigs<00:06:27.310> you<00:06:28.000> could

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:28.149 
especially with synthetic wigs you could

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:30.510 
especially with synthetic wigs you could
just<00:06:28.330> buy<00:06:28.960> a<00:06:28.990> wig<00:06:29.349> that<00:06:29.589> shorter<00:06:30.099> and<00:06:30.370> it's

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
just buy a wig that shorter and it's

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.249 
just buy a wig that shorter and it's
good<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.330> know<00:06:31.360> they<00:06:31.569> have<00:06:31.719> wigs<00:06:31.959> with<00:06:32.139> the

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
good you know they have wigs with the

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.019 
good you know they have wigs with the
same<00:06:32.500> you<00:06:32.860> know<00:06:32.979> curl<00:06:33.279> pattern<00:06:33.610> in<00:06:33.759> it<00:06:33.819> so<00:06:33.940> it

00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:34.029 
same you know curl pattern in it so it

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:35.680 
same you know curl pattern in it so it
doesn't<00:06:34.180> make<00:06:34.360> sense<00:06:34.389> about<00:06:34.899> with<00:06:35.139> this<00:06:35.349> long

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
doesn't make sense about with this long

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.270 
doesn't make sense about with this long
and<00:06:35.900> just<00:06:36.110> cut<00:06:36.290> it<00:06:36.320> unless<00:06:36.710> that's<00:06:36.890> just<00:06:37.160> what

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
and just cut it unless that's just what

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.980 
and just cut it unless that's just what
you<00:06:37.400> want<00:06:37.430> to<00:06:37.640> do<00:06:37.790> that's<00:06:38.480> what<00:06:38.660> you<00:06:38.750> want<00:06:38.930> to

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
you want to do that's what you want to

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.940 
you want to do that's what you want to
do<00:06:39.110> do<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.770> boo<00:06:39.980> but<00:06:40.820> anywho<00:06:41.210> I<00:06:42.020> just<00:06:42.770> wanted

you<00:06:44.420> guys<00:06:44.510> this<00:06:44.900> week<00:06:45.110> I<00:06:45.290> give<00:06:45.890> her<00:06:46.280> three

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.620 
you guys this week I give her three
stars<00:06:47.540> out<00:06:47.900> of<00:06:47.960> five<00:06:48.290> three<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:49.760> one<00:06:50.180> reason

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
stars out of five three and one reason

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.600 
stars out of five three and one reason
why<00:06:50.660> I'm<00:06:50.870> not<00:06:50.900> giving<00:06:51.320> her<00:06:51.470> a<00:06:51.890> more<00:06:52.310> higher

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
why I'm not giving her a more higher

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.390 
why I'm not giving her a more higher
star<00:06:53.150> is<00:06:53.870> because<00:06:54.350> of<00:06:54.500> the<00:06:54.590> parting<00:06:54.920> space<00:06:55.040> I'm

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
star is because of the parting space I'm

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.340 
star is because of the parting space I'm
not<00:06:55.700> feeling<00:06:56.180> the<00:06:56.390> parting<00:06:56.720> space<00:06:56.960> on<00:06:57.200> this

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 
not feeling the parting space on this

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.590 
not feeling the parting space on this
week<00:06:57.560> I<00:06:57.920> think<00:06:58.790> maybe<00:06:59.030> they<00:06:59.210> could<00:06:59.360> have<00:06:59.420> done

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
week I think maybe they could have done

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.910 
week I think maybe they could have done
a<00:06:59.630> little<00:06:59.780> bit<00:07:00.020> of<00:07:00.110> a<00:07:00.200> better<00:07:00.380> job<00:07:00.620> with<00:07:00.800> the

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920 
a little bit of a better job with the

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.570 
a little bit of a better job with the
parting<00:07:01.220> space<00:07:01.370> but<00:07:02.000> I<00:07:03.220> think<00:07:04.220> it's<00:07:04.370> an

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
parting space but I think it's an

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.970 
parting space but I think it's an
excellent<00:07:05.120> week<00:07:05.240> I<00:07:05.450> will<00:07:05.660> buy<00:07:05.840> another<00:07:06.140> one<00:07:06.380> if

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
I could get my hands on another one I

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.150 
I could get my hands on another one I
will<00:07:08.720> buy<00:07:08.840> another<00:07:08.990> one<00:07:09.350> of<00:07:09.440> these<00:07:09.590> units<00:07:10.010> I
