if it went to one tenth that means

if it went to one tenth that means
$1,500<00:00:50.530> silver<00:00:51.010> from<00:00:51.339> just<00:00:51.609> $18.00

I'm<00:00:52.809> not<00:00:53.139> guaranteeing<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.800> that's<00:00:54.100> going

I'm not guaranteeing that that's going

I'm not guaranteeing that that's going

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
to happen these are just numbers but I

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.009 
to happen these are just numbers but I
do<00:00:58.299> expect<00:00:59.049> you<00:00:59.920> know<00:01:00.399> in<00:01:00.519> 1980<00:01:00.999> it<00:01:01.149> was<00:01:01.179> 1/16

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
do expect you know in 1980 it was 1/16

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.740 
do expect you know in 1980 it was 1/16
of<00:01:02.199> gold's<00:01:02.829> price<00:01:03.100> I'm<00:01:03.819> expecting<00:01:04.540> better

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
of gold's price I'm expecting better

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.400 
of gold's price I'm expecting better
than<00:01:05.050> 1/16<00:01:05.880> most<00:01:06.880> likely<00:01:07.390> better<00:01:07.600> than<00:01:07.870> 1/10

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
than 1/16 most likely better than 1/10

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.480 
than 1/16 most likely better than 1/10
so<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.180> 1/10<00:01:10.690> would<00:01:10.870> mean<00:01:11.050> $1,500<00:01:11.890> silver<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
so and 1/10 would mean $1,500 silver and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.470 
so and 1/10 would mean $1,500 silver and
that<00:01:12.640> that's<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:13.210> lot<00:01:13.870> I<00:01:14.680> know<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.430> don't<00:01:16.180> expect

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
that that's a lot I know I don't expect

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.870 
that that's a lot I know I don't expect

it to stay there Silver's mining costs

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.810 
it to stay there Silver's mining costs
are<00:01:19.000> significantly<00:01:19.600> below<00:01:19.840> gold<00:01:20.550> but<00:01:21.550> mining
