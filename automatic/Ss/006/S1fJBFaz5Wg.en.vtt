passes<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.670> realized<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.879> Dallas<00:00:39.300> defense<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
passes I realized this Dallas defense is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
passes I realized this Dallas defense is
on<00:00:40.079> pace<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> be<00:00:40.860> all-time<00:00:41.489> worst<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.090> yards

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
allowed and I realized that this Dallas

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.100 
allowed and I realized that this Dallas
defense<00:00:47.250> Stephen<00:00:47.789> Highsmith<00:00:48.180> has<00:00:48.510> already

defense Stephen Highsmith has already
given<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.950> most<00:00:49.980> fourth-quarter<00:00:50.879> points

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

think that's pretty significant the
people<00:01:03.149> who<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> oddsmakers<00:01:03.899> are

saying they're a little better than the

saying they're a little better than the
Washington<00:01:06.510> Redskins

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Washington Redskins

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.399

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
NFC's this year and within those

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
NFC's this year and within those
division<00:01:16.560> games<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.580> point<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
division games just a little point of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210 
division games just a little point of
order<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.479> they've<00:01:19.259> only<00:01:19.590> allowed<00:01:19.950> an

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
order here they've only allowed an

average of 17.7 points per game in the
four<00:01:24.060> division<00:01:24.479> games<00:01:24.659> I'd<00:01:24.840> say<00:01:25.049> that's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
four division games I'd say that's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.490 
four division games I'd say that's
highly<00:01:25.920> respectable<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.780> long<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.350> they're

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
highly respectable so as long as they're

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910 
highly respectable so as long as they're
playing<00:01:29.180> within<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.420> division<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
playing within the division down to the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
playing within the division down to the
competition<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> division<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.930> my

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
competition of the division I like my

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
competition of the division I like my
Cowboys<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.270> I'll<00:01:36.270> give<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.810> Kirk

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
Cowboys and I'll give you this Kirk

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
Cowboys and I'll give you this Kirk
Cousins<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.829> they'll<00:01:38.009> throw<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.460> his<00:01:38.579> 400

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
Cousins don't they'll throw for his 400

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
Cousins don't they'll throw for his 400
yards<00:01:39.450> I'm<00:01:39.600> sure<00:01:39.840> he'll<00:01:40.350> throw<00:01:40.590> three

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
yards I'm sure he'll throw three

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
yards I'm sure he'll throw three
touchdown<00:01:41.310> passes<00:01:41.340> he<00:01:42.240> also<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.899> throw<00:01:43.140> two

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
touchdown passes he also will throw two

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.270 
touchdown passes he also will throw two
interceptions

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
interceptions

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.310 
interceptions
and<00:01:44.369> I'll<00:01:44.790> say<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> Redskins<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.780> lose<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and I'll say the Redskins will lose to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560 
and I'll say the Redskins will lose to
other<00:01:46.350> turnovers<00:01:47.100> by<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> fumble<00:01:47.880> because

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
other turnovers by a fumble because

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.710 
other turnovers by a fumble because
Dallas<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.380> still<00:01:49.799> plus<00:01:50.310> 11<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.240> turnovers

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Dallas is still plus 11 in turnovers

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
Dallas is still plus 11 in turnovers
which<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.079> second<00:01:52.560> best<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.070> NFL<00:01:53.430> tied<00:01:54.060> for

understand
so<00:04:41.039> those<00:04:41.189> few<00:04:41.550> hours<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.659> you<00:04:42.810> listen<00:04:43.139> to

so those few hours that you listen to

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.020 
so those few hours that you listen to
cowboy<00:04:43.500> nation<00:04:44.159> saying<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:44.550> could<00:04:44.699> get<00:04:44.849> it<00:04:44.939> was

Oh then they ruin it it would fall right

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.659 
Oh then they ruin it it would fall right
into<00:04:48.840> my<00:04:49.020> thinking<00:04:49.349> for<00:04:49.919> exactly<00:04:50.370> who<00:04:50.550> the

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
into my thinking for exactly who the

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.459 
into my thinking for exactly who the
Cowboys<00:04:51.120> had<00:04:51.360> proved<00:04:51.629> it<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.990> be<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.229> really

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
Cowboys had proved it to be it's really

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.869 
Cowboys had proved it to be it's really
not<00:04:52.560> my<00:04:52.710> thinking<00:04:53.039> it's<00:04:53.310> something<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.759> I've

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
not my thinking it's something that I've

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.379 
not my thinking it's something that I've
proven<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.659> a<00:04:54.810> fact<00:04:55.169> but<00:04:55.740> it's<00:04:56.430> reversed<00:04:56.909> the

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
proven it's a fact but it's reversed the

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.390 
proven it's a fact but it's reversed the
Cowboys<00:04:57.840> have<00:04:57.990> 2<00:04:58.110> 1<00:04:58.289> o'clock<00:04:58.500> game<00:04:58.860> now<00:04:59.099> and

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
Cowboys have 2 1 o'clock game now and

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.300 
Cowboys have 2 1 o'clock game now and
eagles<00:05:00.330> have<00:05:00.479> denied<00:05:00.900> game<00:05:01.199> so<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:01.979> a<00:05:02.069> little

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
eagles have denied game so it's a little

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.790 
eagles have denied game so it's a little
bit<00:05:02.610> different<00:05:02.939> could<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.199> Cowboys

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
bit different could I see the Cowboys

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.959

regular-season game that's the one I
wait<00:05:29.789> for<00:05:30.000> right<00:05:30.210> there<00:05:30.419> because<00:05:30.979> that's<00:05:31.979> the

wait for right there because that's the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.029 
wait for right there because that's the
scenario<00:05:32.460> that's<00:05:33.270> near<00:05:33.659> see<00:05:33.960> if<00:05:34.050> Dallas<00:05:34.289> loses

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
scenario that's near see if Dallas loses

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.999 
scenario that's near see if Dallas loses
and<00:05:35.550> an<00:05:35.699> Eagles<00:05:36.180> win<00:05:36.449> then<00:05:37.349> the<00:05:37.440> last<00:05:37.620> game<00:05:37.979> of

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
and an Eagles win then the last game of
