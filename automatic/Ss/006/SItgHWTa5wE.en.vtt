00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of games come as well and I had to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
of games come as well and I had to
completely<00:01:56.939> change<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.630> approach<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
completely change up my approach to the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
completely change up my approach to the
arena<00:01:59.100> mode<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.329> running

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
arena mode because I was just running

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.850 
arena mode because I was just running
out<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.930> getting<00:02:01.170> picked<00:02:01.380> off<00:02:01.500> wasn't

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
out there getting picked off wasn't

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.020 
out there getting picked off wasn't
really<00:02:02.009> working<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.460> team<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> wasn't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
really working my team I wasn't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999 
really working my team I wasn't
communicating<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.530> other<00:02:04.649> team<00:02:04.829> was

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
communicating so the other team was

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.350 
communicating so the other team was
really<00:02:05.250> organized<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.850> was<00:02:05.969> saying<00:02:06.149> where

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
really organized I was saying where

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
really organized I was saying where
everyone<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.740> just<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:08.039> destroyed

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
everyone was and we just got destroyed

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.300 
everyone was and we just got destroyed
in<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> first<00:02:09.149> game<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.599> think<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.310> 27

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
in the first game I think it was like 27

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.059 
in the first game I think it was like 27
to<00:02:11.610> us

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
to us

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.699 
to us
50<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.519> them<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.969> we<00:02:13.239> got<00:02:13.420> pretty<00:02:13.719> warped<00:02:14.290> over

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
50 to them so we got pretty warped over

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.319 
50 to them so we got pretty warped over
and<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.280> gameplay<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.670> guys<00:02:15.969> are<00:02:16.150> watching

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
and the gameplay you guys are watching

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.039 
and the gameplay you guys are watching
was<00:02:16.930> my<00:02:17.439> team's<00:02:18.010> personal<00:02:18.849> best<00:02:19.480> game<00:02:19.810> where<00:02:20.019> I

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
was my team's personal best game where I

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.170 
was my team's personal best game where I
think<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.349> won<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> from<00:02:20.829> like<00:02:21.010> about<00:02:21.249> 50<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.879> 20

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
think we won it from like about 50 to 20

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.089 
think we won it from like about 50 to 20
kills<00:02:22.450> had<00:02:22.930> tons<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.230> fun<00:02:23.379> but<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.829> biggest

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
kills had tons of fun but the biggest

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.949 
kills had tons of fun but the biggest

tip I can give you is communication if
you're<00:02:26.079> working<00:02:26.319> together<00:02:26.620> if<00:02:26.889> you're

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
you're working together if you're

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.949 
you're working together if you're
helping<00:02:27.280> each<00:02:27.549> other<00:02:27.670> pick<00:02:27.939> up<00:02:28.090> kills<00:02:28.359> you're

helping each other pick up kills you're

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.869 
helping each other pick up kills you're
far<00:02:29.349> more<00:02:29.379> likely<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:30.099> win<00:02:30.219> the<00:02:30.370> game<00:02:30.579> because

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
far more likely to win the game because

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.910 
far more likely to win the game because
you<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.540> say<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.019> you've<00:02:32.290> got<00:02:32.409> an<00:02:32.500> opponent<00:02:32.889> on

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
you can say if you've got an opponent on

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.679 
you can say if you've got an opponent on
one<00:02:33.099> shot<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.430> your<00:02:33.579> teammate<00:02:34.090> knows<00:02:34.329> they<00:02:34.540> can

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
one shot so your teammate knows they can

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.780 
one shot so your teammate knows they can
change<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.170> pick<00:02:35.319> up<00:02:35.439> that<00:02:35.590> kill<00:02:35.889> and<00:02:36.129> it's<00:02:36.670> an

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
change a pick up that kill and it's an

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.240 
change a pick up that kill and it's an
amazing<00:02:37.439> progression<00:02:38.439> of<00:02:38.560> how<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:38.799> start

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
amazing progression of how you start

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
working with your team in arena because
