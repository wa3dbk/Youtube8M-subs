00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
easy you know sometimes you know but

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
easy you know sometimes you know but
when<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> slide<00:01:06.960> couple<00:01:07.380> times<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
when you when you slide couple times and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
when you when you slide couple times and
I<00:01:07.920> will<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.610> used<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> yeah<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.750> about<00:01:09.810> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I will get used to yeah what about like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
I will get used to yeah what about like
drop<00:01:10.350> shots<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.830> more<00:01:11.040> drop<00:01:11.250> shots<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> clay

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
drop shots a lot more drop shots on clay

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.820 
drop shots a lot more drop shots on clay
but<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.200> more<00:01:13.619> drop

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
but you have to use you know more drop

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280 
but you have to use you know more drop
shot<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.820> hard-code<00:01:15.420> or<00:01:15.630> grass<00:01:16.049> club

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
shot than then hard-code or grass club

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010 
shot than then hard-code or grass club
because<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> doesn't<00:01:18.240> bounce<00:01:18.689> high

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
because you know it doesn't bounce high

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
because you know it doesn't bounce high
as<00:01:19.350> much<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.250> hardcore<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.299> think

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
as much as you know hardcore and I think

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.260 
as much as you know hardcore and I think
it's<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.290> effective<00:01:22.560> than<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:23.430> surface

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.210 

you<00:01:30.270> don't<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.410> of<00:01:31.560> topspin<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> your

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you don't put a lot of topspin on your

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
you don't put a lot of topspin on your
shots<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.730> obviously<00:01:33.360> topspin<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.960> big

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
shots but obviously topspin is a big

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.060 
shots but obviously topspin is a big
part<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> clay<00:01:34.650> court<00:01:34.890> tennis<00:01:35.060> it's<00:01:36.060> more

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
part of clay court tennis it's more

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.380 
part of clay court tennis it's more
effective<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.700> hot<00:01:38.970> cool<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
effective than you know hot cool you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.800 
effective than you know hot cool you
know<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:40.680> bounce<00:01:40.830> high<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
know you can bounce high and you can you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
know you can bounce high and you can you
can<00:01:42.960> make<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.950> know<00:01:43.980> stay<00:01:44.490> stay<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:45.000> so
