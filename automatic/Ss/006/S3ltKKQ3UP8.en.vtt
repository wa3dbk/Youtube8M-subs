 notches compared with the previous 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 model differences can be said

 standby set of video inputs in this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 model is identical to that of pei 238 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.800
 displayport with dima gevei and in g as well 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.380

 audio output made as minijack 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
 the first thing you notice when 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.549
 looking at the monitor this massive 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 stand he weighs more than five kilograms 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.060

 a scale is also attached to its base 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 allowing you to measure the angle of rotation in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.430
 the whole construction was tough 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 calculate a little 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 the monitor does not work out even specially when 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 delivery can be disconnected 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.619
 mounting screws so this rubber 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 caps and hang the monitor on the wall

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 one of the color temperature modes 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 some items may not be available in 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.090
 depending on the selected mode in it 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.709
 usb tape menu image you can 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.390

 proprietary technology triz free 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.519
 allowing to reduce the response time in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.349
 section of the sound you can change the level

 to factory settings and some 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.040
 other options 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.240

 also the outlines of documents of various 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.220
 sizes in this monitor are used 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.590
 hilt matrix with a diagonal of 23 inches 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.350
 aspect ratio of 16 9 and native 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.240
 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.550
 claimed response time of 6 milliseconds 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.230
 viewing angles traditionally for the pes matrix 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.640
 great with increasing viewing angle 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 brightness decreases slightly 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.910

 plane heads effect practically 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.740
 missing 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.760

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.760
 reasonably moderate 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.530
 unlike the fairies 238 tk, the new model does not 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.790
 undergoing factory calibration so 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.540
 if the monitor will be used for 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.240
 work with color 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 it will have to be calibrated manually asus 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.930
