00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.540 

axel<00:01:04.120> market<00:01:04.980> so<00:01:05.980> we<00:01:06.070> know<00:01:06.190> what<00:01:06.340> we're<00:01:06.460> going

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
axel market so we know what we're going

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.880 
axel market so we know what we're going
to<00:01:06.670> sand<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.210> of<00:01:08.200> course<00:01:08.410> rather<00:01:08.650> than

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
to sand and of course rather than

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.640 
to sand and of course rather than
rerouting<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.750> edge<00:01:10.750> here<00:01:11.050> which<00:01:11.350> would<00:01:11.470> be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
rerouting the edge here which would be

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.310 
rerouting the edge here which would be
tremendous<00:01:12.190> amount<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.460> time<00:01:12.700> and<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.320> risk

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
tremendous amount of time and it risk

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.160 
tremendous amount of time and it risk
the<00:01:14.410> possibility<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:16.020> ruining<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.140> whole

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
the possibility of ruining the whole

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.230 
the possibility of ruining the whole
piece<00:01:17.470> altogether<00:01:17.920> we're<00:01:18.670> simply<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.120> to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
piece altogether we're simply going to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.830 
piece altogether we're simply going to
sand<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.800> bottom<00:01:21.130> edge<00:01:21.610> here<00:01:22.150> or<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.450> walnut

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
sand the bottom edge here or the walnut

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.680 
sand the bottom edge here or the walnut
too<00:01:23.440> much<00:01:23.619> softer<00:01:24.040> wood<00:01:24.280> shouldn't<00:01:25.000> take<00:01:25.479> too

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
too much softer wood shouldn't take too

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.840 
too much softer wood shouldn't take too
much<00:01:25.900> time<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.380> trouble<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.860> then<00:01:27.640> hopefully

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
much time of trouble and then hopefully

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.370 
much time of trouble and then hopefully
we're<00:01:28.450> going<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.660> have<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> nice<00:01:29.020> sleep<00:01:31.380> take

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
we're going to have a nice sleep take

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.450 
we're going to have a nice sleep take
our<00:01:32.560> chisel

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
our chisel

00:01:34.460 --> 00:02:09.450 
our chisel
and<00:01:34.940> just<00:01:35.120> little<00:01:35.659> by<00:01:35.840> little
