loan TV clip on noise cancelling which
covers<00:01:23.820> off<00:01:23.939> some<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.630> more

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
covers off some of that in a bit more

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.090 
covers off some of that in a bit more
detail<00:01:27.020> pretty<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.170> all<00:01:28.290> speakers<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
detail pretty well all speakers have to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
detail pretty well all speakers have to
have<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> voice<00:01:29.520> coil<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.119> order<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
have a voice coil in order for them to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.249 
have a voice coil in order for them to
work<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.390> unique

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
work in this way and so what is unique

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
work in this way and so what is unique
about<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.860> speakers<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.240> what's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
about these speakers is they have what's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
about these speakers is they have what's
called<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.720> dual<00:01:37.020> voice<00:01:37.229> coil<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> dual

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
called a dual voice coil and a dual

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
called a dual voice coil and a dual
voice<00:01:38.729> coil<00:01:39.060> essentially<00:01:39.750> means<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
voice coil essentially means that you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.499 
voice coil essentially means that you
have<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.920> those<00:01:41.100> rounds<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> wire<00:01:41.820> wrapped

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
have two of those rounds of wire wrapped

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.080 
have two of those rounds of wire wrapped
in<00:01:42.720> around<00:01:43.229> behind<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> speaker<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
in around behind the speaker now the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.639 
in around behind the speaker now the
main<00:01:45.329> benefit<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.350> gives<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.619> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
main benefit of that is it gives you a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
main benefit of that is it gives you a
great<00:01:46.950> deal<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.189> flexibility<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> way

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
great deal more flexibility in the way

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
great deal more flexibility in the way
you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:48.990> wire<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:50.100> subwoofers

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you can actually wire these subwoofers

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
you can actually wire these subwoofers
and<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.450> particularly<00:01:52.110> relevant<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and it's particularly relevant because a

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
and it's particularly relevant because a
subwoofer<00:01:53.490> since<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.600> using<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.350> much

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
subwoofer since it is using so much

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
subwoofer since it is using so much
energy<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.100> drive<00:01:56.310> such<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> large<00:01:57.030> speaker

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
energy to drive such a large speaker

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920 
energy to drive such a large speaker
requires<00:01:58.890> some<00:01:59.640> additional<00:01:59.759> flexibility<00:02:00.689> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
requires some additional flexibility in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.929 
requires some additional flexibility in

you<00:02:30.709> would<00:02:30.920> do<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.219> for<00:02:31.430> example<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.969> you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
you would do this for example is you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.849 
you would do this for example is you
might<00:02:32.239> use<00:02:32.389> a<00:02:32.420> single<00:02:32.870> amplifier<00:02:33.139> with

audio<00:03:23.719> circuit<00:03:24.199> is<00:03:24.319> very<00:03:24.949> similar<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.639> that<00:03:25.759> of

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
audio circuit is very similar to that of

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.420 
audio circuit is very similar to that of
resistance<00:03:26.689> and<00:03:26.930> for<00:03:27.500> example<00:03:27.739> your<00:03:28.220> home

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
resistance and for example your home

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.259 
resistance and for example your home
wiring<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:30.049> by<00:03:30.620> reducing<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.280> impedance<00:03:31.790> you

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
wiring so by reducing the impedance you

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.210 
wiring so by reducing the impedance you
can<00:03:32.419> actually<00:03:32.720> get<00:03:32.900> more<00:03:33.169> efficiency<00:03:33.859> out<00:03:34.129> of

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
can actually get more efficiency out of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.939 
can actually get more efficiency out of
the<00:03:34.310> amplifier<00:03:34.759> and<00:03:34.970> therefore<00:03:35.389> more<00:03:35.540> power

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
the amplifier and therefore more power

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.309

now<00:03:36.949> this<00:03:37.129> is<00:03:37.250> great<00:03:37.489> because<00:03:38.019> amplifiers<00:03:39.019> and

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
now this is great because amplifiers and

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.469 
now this is great because amplifiers and
subwoofers<00:03:40.280> are<00:03:40.430> actually<00:03:40.849> best<00:03:41.120> matched
