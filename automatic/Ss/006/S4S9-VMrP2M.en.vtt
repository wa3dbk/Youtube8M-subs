from scratch you need two products 1 is
hydrogen<00:00:37.270> peroxide<00:00:37.660> i<00:00:38.320> got<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.650> 20<00:00:38.890> volume

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
hydrogen peroxide i got the 20 volume

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.310 
hydrogen peroxide i got the 20 volume
you<00:00:39.520> can<00:00:39.579> buy<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:39.850> at<00:00:40.060> Sally's<00:00:40.630> Beauty<00:00:41.140> Supply

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
that's what the other is some clear

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.100

ammonia<00:00:45.160> but<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.120> moni<00:00:46.360> does<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.960> it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
ammonia but the moni does is it

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.810 
ammonia but the moni does is it
accelerates<00:00:47.770> the<00:00:47.920> action<00:00:48.340> of<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.520> hydro

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
accelerates the action of the hydro

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.680 
accelerates the action of the hydro
peroxide<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.530> I'm<00:00:50.829> going<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:51.160> fill<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
peroxide so I'm going to fill this

now I'm going to put a little bit of

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.530 
now I'm going to put a little bit of
ammonia<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.430> here<00:01:00.610> to<00:01:01.260> accelerate<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.410> I<00:01:03.540> like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
ammonia in here to accelerate it I like

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.250 
ammonia in here to accelerate it I like
to<00:01:04.629> go<00:01:04.780> about<00:01:04.989> five<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.530> one<00:01:07.020> doesn't<00:01:08.020> have<00:01:08.140> to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
to go about five to one doesn't have to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
to go about five to one doesn't have to
be<00:01:08.410> exact<00:01:08.800> will<00:01:09.070> mix<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.430> up
