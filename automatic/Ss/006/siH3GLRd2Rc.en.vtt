00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.559
 Hi there, people Mushkin did not do everything 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.559
 tutorial on the back yener 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.439
 Now I will explain all the stages on 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.800
 this element is a little technical 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:38.020
 a little complicated well as anyone in the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:43.780
 Now let's look at the principle like 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:47.140
 interpretation so here and here first tires 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.600
 workouts this here is such a pier once wow 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.510
 so time 2 that is here we sit like this 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.320
 we need to unfold the hull and pushed 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.719
 so this is the first that he and 3 minutes still 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.750
 The main feature in this item is 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.879
 When I studied, I thought that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.460
 most importantly kicked off when 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.100
 you saw when employees do that 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.710
 that is, in the same place there are no them but no 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.800
 push your legs that is the more you 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.720
 you will make this element 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.729
 sharpen make everything ok beautiful 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.009
 then you can even do without jolt 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.460
 legs that is but for now mother we are learning 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.100
 do 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.659
 pushing the legs that is we train it 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.960
 movement and 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.299
 as if touching the very essence of this 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.330
 we turned out an element we develop 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.000
 the case is 180 degrees to here on 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.500
 90 0 expand the body 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 slightly touch your foot against the wall and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.729
 Spinning around for help hands that is due to 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 hands we bang and spinning 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.070
 in principle, that's the best I can still affected 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.320
 on this element we are spinning just for 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.720
 account hands helping myself with my feet 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.750
 we can under Mahmud there is still the main feature 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.030
 so we do not need much 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.189
 set your foot high over the fence 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.409
 what can expand and you husband do 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.070
 already straight and let's forget how to blame and 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.310
 that is, much to insert some well 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.310
 here 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.850
 here that is when i did i admit 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 some such mistakes when i did 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.530
 because I started well, that's just like that here 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.900
 forget my hand without straightening 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.370
 wait what you need to do right 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.200
 the pattern on hand renounces feed 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.660
 here so I can and it's a trick 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.830
 that is, they made an element 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.280
 so now try to show you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.070
 at the side 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.980
 so guys here again explain fucking 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.480
 10 times we look at our well here we sit 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.250
 and so right we unfold the body 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 stretch a little bit in your hand like this not 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.500
 much so hand pull it she was 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.600
 together again and a little bit away and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 wipe your hand here we lay here already 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.250
 somewhere but not very high him never 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.650
 not at all because you can not 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.670
 encounter a tour of the past second hand 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.950
 and about somewhere narrow on the table hands 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.020
 set zero, that is, measure like this 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.210
 as it is convenient for someone and I am doing right now 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.660
 I will show you how to do it 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.660
 look 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.710
 This is how the element itself is done. 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.350
 I can't say more 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.040
 then the element is incomprehensible to write in 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.440
 komente if I tell you something, I think 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.130
 I wonder you will be this tutorial on 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.650
 this element 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.520
 the element is beautiful his wanted to learn 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.030
 I learned how to inspire 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.030
 develop try 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.250
 what questions we write subscribe to 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.590
 I order tutorials on the channel all 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.590
 did everything to everyone bye
