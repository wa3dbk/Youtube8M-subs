pattern he's on final action I think I

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
pattern he's on final action I think I
see<00:00:26.170> him<00:00:26.260> down<00:00:26.470> on<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.680> ground<00:00:26.770> right<00:00:27.130> now

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
see him down on the ground right now

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.790 
see him down on the ground right now
everything<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:28.420> looking<00:00:28.750> good<00:00:28.960> but<00:00:29.230> what<00:00:29.710> I'm

everything is looking good but what I'm

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.840 
everything is looking good but what I'm
going<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:29.950> do<00:00:30.100> is<00:00:30.310> I'm<00:00:30.490> going<00:00:30.580> to<00:00:30.640> get<00:00:30.760> to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
going to do is I'm going to get to

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.339 
going to do is I'm going to get to
pattern<00:00:31.210> altitude<00:00:31.539> which<00:00:31.690> is<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:31.840> thousand

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
pattern altitude which is a thousand

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.319 
pattern altitude which is a thousand
feet<00:00:32.469> in<00:00:32.590> this<00:00:32.680> case<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.789> I'm<00:00:34.000> going<00:00:34.270> to

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
feet in this case and I'm going to

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.260 
feet in this case and I'm going to
maintain<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:35.200> thousand<00:00:35.920> feet<00:00:36.129> until<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.730> am<00:00:37.059> on

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
maintain a thousand feet until I am on

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.990 
maintain a thousand feet until I am on
final<00:00:37.899> let's<00:00:38.379> just<00:00:38.590> say<00:00:38.739> listen<00:00:39.100> we<00:00:39.610> all<00:00:39.640> come

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
final let's just say listen we all come

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.460 
final let's just say listen we all come
in<00:00:40.090> high<00:00:40.270> sometimes<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.960> need<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.170> get<00:00:41.320> down

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
in high sometimes you need to get down

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.810 
in high sometimes you need to get down
what<00:00:41.710> can<00:00:41.829> we<00:00:41.920> do<00:00:42.100> to<00:00:42.220> get<00:00:42.310> down<00:00:42.520> I'm<00:00:42.640> going<00:00:42.760> to

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
what can we do to get down I'm going to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.640 
what can we do to get down I'm going to
show<00:00:42.910> you<00:00:42.970> guys<00:00:43.150> a<00:00:43.360> forward<00:00:43.840> slip<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.380> landing

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
show you guys a forward slip to landing

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.770 
show you guys a forward slip to landing
now<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.770> wind<00:00:45.070> is<00:00:45.579> from<00:00:45.910> zero<00:00:46.210> five<00:00:46.420> zero<00:00:46.450> so

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
now the wind is from zero five zero so

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.090 
now the wind is from zero five zero so
the<00:00:46.870> winds<00:00:47.050> right<00:00:47.320> down<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.620> runway<00:00:47.890> so<00:00:47.950> this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
the winds right down the runway so this

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.190 
the winds right down the runway so this
may<00:00:48.220> fairly<00:00:48.489> easy<00:00:48.850> typically<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:49.810> start<00:00:49.870> kind

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
may fairly easy typically you start kind

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.170 
may fairly easy typically you start kind
of<00:00:50.320> slipping<00:00:50.680> into<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.980> wind<00:00:51.250> initially

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
of slipping into the wind initially

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.340 
of slipping into the wind initially
we'll<00:00:52.300> be<00:00:52.390> able<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.570> slip<00:00:52.720> both<00:00:52.960> directions

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
we'll be able to slip both directions

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.380 
we'll be able to slip both directions
I'll<00:00:53.620> be<00:00:53.739> able<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.890> show<00:00:54.130> you<00:00:54.190> that<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.640> I've

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
I'll be able to show you that so I've

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.240 
I'll be able to show you that so I've
approached<00:00:55.780> my<00:00:55.960> altitude<00:00:56.170> here<00:00:56.530> about<00:00:57.130> to

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250

through final and all of a sudden I'm
looking<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:27.840> saying<00:03:28.050> man<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.830> are<00:03:29.010> awfully

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
looking I'm saying man we are awfully

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.510 
looking I'm saying man we are awfully
high<00:03:29.760> one<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.300> earth<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:31.020> do<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.980> get<00:03:32.190> down

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
but without picking up a ton of airspeed

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
but without picking up a ton of airspeed
because<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:34.920> just<00:03:35.070> nosed<00:03:35.340> down

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
because I just nosed down

direction now I'll go ahead and apply
some<00:04:02.490> right<00:04:03.090> pedal<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:03.870> some<00:04:04.500> left<00:04:04.890> aileron

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
some right pedal and some left aileron

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.370 
some right pedal and some left aileron
that's<00:04:05.760> pretty<00:04:05.970> cool<00:04:06.150> huh<00:04:06.210> as<00:04:06.600> we're<00:04:07.140> coming
