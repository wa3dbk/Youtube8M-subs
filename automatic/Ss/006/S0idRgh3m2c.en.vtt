00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
which sucks but the good thing is they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
which sucks but the good thing is they
do<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> money<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:28.340> sell<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.520 
do make a lot of money you can sell the
meat<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.060> give<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:31.049> vendor

meat that they give you to a vendor

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.240 
meat that they give you to a vendor
which<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.030> insane<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.590> meat<00:01:34.829> itself

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
which is insane because the meat itself

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.679 
which is insane because the meat itself
pretty<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.970> pays<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> water<00:01:37.079> buffalo

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
pretty much pays for the water buffalo

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.010 
pretty much pays for the water buffalo
which<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.930> crazy<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> vendor<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.720> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
which is crazy just from a vendor if do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.560 
which is crazy just from a vendor if do
you<00:01:43.049> decide<00:01:43.320> us<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:43.979> make<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> profit

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
you decide us out you will make a profit

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.940 
you decide us out you will make a profit
but<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.899> problem<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.409> people<00:01:46.770> don't

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
but the only problem is people don't

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550 
but the only problem is people don't
really<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.430> pay<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.350> meat

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really want to pay a lot just for meat

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.469 
really want to pay a lot just for meat
just<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.369> level<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.909> cooking<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.360> don't

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just a level up there cooking I don't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
just a level up there cooking I don't
think<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.899> special<00:01:52.170> recipes<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.009> need

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think there's any special recipes I need

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.950 
think there's any special recipes I need
it<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:55.070> would<00:01:56.070> definitely<00:01:57.259> do<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.500> until

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
it so I would definitely do this until

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.109 
it so I would definitely do this until
they<00:02:00.740> hotfix<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.549> cuz<00:02:01.700> I<00:02:01.729> feel<00:02:01.880> like<00:02:02.030> they're

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
they hotfix it cuz I feel like they're

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.910 
they hotfix it cuz I feel like they're
gonna<00:02:02.240> fix<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:02.690> eventually<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.740> is

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
gonna fix it eventually because this is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.080 
gonna fix it eventually because this is
