so always descent really slowly
don't<00:04:57.430> put<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.789> throttle<00:04:58.000> down<00:04:58.180> below<00:04:58.960> 10%<00:05:00.000> if

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
don't put the throttle down below 10% if

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.629 
don't put the throttle down below 10% if
you<00:05:01.210> have<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.570> do<00:05:01.750> it<00:05:01.900> just<00:05:02.110> do<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.770> for<00:05:03.220> a<00:05:03.250> brief
