00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
sounds a little weird so what it is is
basically<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.369> dance<00:01:38.670> around<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
basically you dance around and you have

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
basically you dance around and you have
I<00:01:40.829> guess<00:01:41.280> different<00:01:41.700> levels<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I guess different levels you can get and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
I guess different levels you can get and
just<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.799> Guitar<00:01:44.130> Hero

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just like Guitar Hero

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.440 
just like Guitar Hero
you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.149> great<00:01:45.720> perfect<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:47.450> weak

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you have great perfect and weak

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.440 
you have great perfect and weak
different<00:01:49.229> ratings<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.180> after<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.299> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
different ratings and after that you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
different ratings and after that you
also<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.869> missed<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.159> exact<00:01:53.579> like
