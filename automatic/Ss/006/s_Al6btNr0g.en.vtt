this also ups your draw distance just a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.490 
this also ups your draw distance just a
little<00:02:36.700> bit<00:02:36.850> because<00:02:37.209> there's<00:02:37.600> no<00:02:37.870> more<00:02:38.140> blur

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
little bit because there's no more blur

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.040 
little bit because there's no more blur
all<00:02:38.920> over<00:02:39.459> things<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.850> are<00:02:40.030> far<00:02:40.239> away<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.870> my

all over things that are far away in my
opinion<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.650> games<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.100> gives<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> game<00:02:42.550> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
opinion it games it gives the game a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.820 
opinion it games it gives the game a
little<00:02:42.819> bit<00:02:43.030> more<00:02:43.090> depth<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> better<00:02:44.380> feel
