this<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> based<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.000> how<00:01:21.180> cool<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> shot<00:01:21.990> is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this one based on how cool the shot is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.620 
this one based on how cool the shot is
so<00:01:22.350> trick<00:01:22.650> shots<00:01:22.979> behind<00:01:23.580> shots<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.509> know

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
so trick shots behind shots you know

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
so trick shots behind shots you know
stuff<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> looks<00:01:25.530> generally<00:01:25.860> cooler<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
stuff that looks generally cooler and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.190 
stuff that looks generally cooler and
it's<00:01:26.880> way<00:01:27.030> harder<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.450> pull<00:01:27.600> off<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> probably

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it's way harder to pull off is probably

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's way harder to pull off is probably
more<00:01:28.320> likely<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.860> picked<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
more likely to get picked for the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.219 
more likely to get picked for the
challenge<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.390> yeah<00:01:30.600> all<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> is
