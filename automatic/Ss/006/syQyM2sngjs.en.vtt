00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this and I always apply way too much at

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.560 
this and I always apply way too much at
first<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.340> looks<00:00:32.550> kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> yellow<00:00:33.149> but

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
first and it looks kind of yellow but

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
first and it looks kind of yellow but

it's okay just rub it all in and it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's okay just rub it all in and it
looks<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:39.530> because<00:00:40.530> I've<00:00:40.680> raised<00:00:40.829> my

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
but it definitely minimizes the Grand

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130

my<00:01:12.000> face<00:01:12.150> here<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.869> tell<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.469 
my face here so you can tell the
difference<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.220> definitely<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
difference and I definitely do like a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.120 
difference and I definitely do like a
full<00:01:15.720> review<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> my<00:01:16.110> blog<00:01:16.229> pictures<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
full review on my blog pictures and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.359 
full review on my blog pictures and
everything<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.850> keeping<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
everything so keeping up with that

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.830 
everything so keeping up with that
obviously<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.880> looks<00:01:21.030> we're<00:01:21.299> darker<00:01:21.600> than<00:01:21.720> my

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
obviously it looks we're darker than my

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.020 
obviously it looks we're darker than my
neck<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.560> face<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.920> naturally<00:01:23.310> darker<00:01:23.670> so

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
neck but my face is naturally darker so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
neck but my face is naturally darker so
that<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.630> always<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.350> case<00:01:25.500> unless<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> went

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that is always the case unless I went

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.710 
that is always the case unless I went
like<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.790> shades<00:01:27.090> lighter<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.600> my

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
like two shades lighter with my

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.870 
like two shades lighter with my
foundation<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> down

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
foundation so I'm going to take it down

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
foundation so I'm going to take it down
my<00:01:30.060> neck<00:01:30.240> too<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> difference<00:01:31.470> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
my neck too because the difference on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.649 
my neck too because the difference on
camera<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.640> more<00:01:32.850> noticeable<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
camera is way more noticeable in

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
camera is way more noticeable in
everyday<00:01:34.290> life<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.680> really<00:01:35.100> wouldn't<00:01:35.310> bother

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430

lashes more of a natural look you could

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.550

but<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.400> know<00:03:48.430> if<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.819> think<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> lashes<00:03:49.450> at

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
but you know if I think the lashes at

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.600 
but you know if I think the lashes at
the<00:03:49.629> moment<00:03:49.989> so<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.470> course<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:51.069> going<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.489> add

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
the moment so of course I'm going to add

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.430 
the moment so of course I'm going to add
some<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.150> only<00:03:52.329> using<00:03:52.540> individual<00:03:53.200> lashes

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
some I'm only using individual lashes

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.949 
some I'm only using individual lashes
though<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.220> feel<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.239> doesn't<00:03:55.359> count

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
though so I feel like that doesn't count

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.020 
though so I feel like that doesn't count
I<00:03:55.989> only<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.440> four<00:03:56.620> left<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.250> I'm<00:03:57.489> not<00:03:57.670> going

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
I only have four left so I'm not going

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.789 
I only have four left so I'm not going
crazy<00:03:58.269> or<00:03:58.630> anything<00:03:58.660> I'm<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.290> going<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.650> use

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
crazy or anything I'm just going to use

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.650 
crazy or anything I'm just going to use
the<00:03:59.920> two<00:04:00.069> longer<00:04:00.400> ones<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.090> outer<00:04:01.269> corner

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
the two longer ones in the outer corner

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.569 
the two longer ones in the outer corner
and<00:04:01.870> then<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> short<00:04:02.650> ones<00:04:02.859> where<00:04:03.160> my<00:04:03.250> eyelash

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
and then the short ones where my eyelash

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.270 
and then the short ones where my eyelash
is<00:04:03.730> that<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.180> naturally<00:04:04.359> sparse<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.799> then

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
is that just naturally sparse so then

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.949 
is that just naturally sparse so then
that's<00:04:06.549> that<00:04:06.670> I'm<00:04:07.030> going<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.510> go<00:04:07.569> back<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.840> the

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
that's that I'm going to go back to the

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.629 
that's that I'm going to go back to the
eyes<00:04:08.049> in<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.290> second<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:09.010> while<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.459> glue<00:04:09.579> is

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
eyes in a second but while the glue is

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.330 
eyes in a second but while the glue is
drying<00:04:09.970> I'm<00:04:10.329> going<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.840> go<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.349> contour<00:04:12.040> if

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
drying I'm going to go on and contour if

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.530 
drying I'm going to go on and contour if
you<00:04:12.489> go<00:04:12.579> straight<00:04:12.819> in<00:04:12.910> with<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.090> powder<00:04:13.269> of

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
you go straight in with the powder of

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.990 
you go straight in with the powder of
this<00:04:13.780> CC<00:04:14.170> cream<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.709> tends<00:04:15.099> to<00:04:15.250> just<00:04:15.760> look

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
this CC cream it tends to just look

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.060 
this CC cream it tends to just look
patchy<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.780> dirty<00:04:17.200> so<00:04:17.560> I'm<00:04:17.709> going<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:17.919> use

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
patchy and dirty so I'm going to use

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.800 
patchy and dirty so I'm going to use
cream<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.519> liquid<00:04:18.789> products<00:04:19.209> instead<00:04:19.570> I'm

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
cream of liquid products instead I'm

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.779 
cream of liquid products instead I'm
first<00:04:20.169> going<00:04:20.380> in<00:04:20.530> with<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.889> smaller<00:04:21.310> brush<00:04:21.549> and

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
first going in with a smaller brush and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.589 
first going in with a smaller brush and
this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.630> segment<00:04:23.039> p84<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:25.240> am<00:04:25.300> just

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
this is the segment p84 and I am just

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.659 
this is the segment p84 and I am just
using<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:26.169> concealer<00:04:26.590> from<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.280> Coastal

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
using a concealer from the Coastal

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.779 
using a concealer from the Coastal
Scents<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.860> camouflage<00:04:29.860> color<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.370> think<00:04:30.669> it's

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
Scents and camouflage color I think it's

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.270 
Scents and camouflage color I think it's
called<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.419> I'm<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.840> using<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.289> f88<00:04:32.740> buff

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
called then I'm just using the f88 buff

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:46.439 
called then I'm just using the f88 buff
that<00:04:33.310> out

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.149 

with<00:04:47.449> what's<00:04:47.659> remaining<00:04:47.960> on<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.680> first<00:04:48.919> brush

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
with what's remaining on the first brush

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.830 
with what's remaining on the first brush
I<00:04:49.370> went<00:04:49.699> down<00:04:49.849> the<00:04:49.939> sides<00:04:50.150> of<00:04:50.240> my<00:04:50.360> nose<00:04:50.389> and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
I went down the sides of my nose and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.899 
I went down the sides of my nose and
this<00:04:51.319> actually<00:04:51.710> looks<00:04:51.889> way<00:04:52.159> more<00:04:52.189> natural<00:04:52.490> and

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
this actually looks way more natural and

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.059 
this actually looks way more natural and
power<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:53.539> I've<00:04:53.810> actually<00:04:53.960> integrated<00:04:54.919> this

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
power so I've actually integrated this

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.469 
power so I've actually integrated this
into<00:04:55.340> my<00:04:55.669> normal<00:04:55.729> routine<00:04:56.270> as<00:04:56.509> well<00:04:56.659> recently

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.999 

moving<00:05:02.479> on<00:05:02.599> to<00:05:02.689> concealer<00:05:03.020> I'm<00:05:03.349> using<00:05:03.409> one

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
moving on to concealer I'm using one

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.800 
moving on to concealer I'm using one
from<00:05:04.129> the<00:05:04.250> same<00:05:04.430> collection<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.569> stuff
