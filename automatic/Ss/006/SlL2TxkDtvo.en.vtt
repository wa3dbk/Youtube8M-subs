it's<00:00:25.500> huge<00:00:25.680> okay<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.210> concept<00:00:27.599> behind<00:00:27.689> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it's huge okay the concept behind this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's huge okay the concept behind this
size<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:29.400> far<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.760> Samsung's<00:00:30.119> marketing

campaign<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.470> concerned<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.690> know

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
campaign is concerned is that you know

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.260 
campaign is concerned is that you know
since<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.320> tablet<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.100> essentially<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
since a tablet is essentially just a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.080 
since a tablet is essentially just a
giant<00:00:36.570> phone<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.489> they<00:00:38.489> could<00:00:38.550> figure<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
giant phone if they could figure out a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.290 
giant phone if they could figure out a
screen<00:00:39.989> size<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.649> between<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.579> they

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
screen size just in between the two they

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
screen size just in between the two they
could<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.750> magical<00:00:43.340> phone<00:00:44.340> tab<00:00:44.760> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
could have this magical phone tab and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
could have this magical phone tab and
it's<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> phone<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> tablet<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's is it a phone is it a tablet it's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's is it a phone is it a tablet it's
the<00:00:47.219> best<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.520> both<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> question<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> though

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the best of both the question is though

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
the best of both the question is though
even<00:00:51.120> though<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.600> great<00:00:52.260> concept<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
even though that is a great concept in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.889 
even though that is a great concept in
theory<00:00:53.910> does<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.050> work<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
theory does it actually work and the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
theory does it actually work and the
answer<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.320> no<00:00:59.390> well<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:01.260> at<00:01:01.590> least<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
answer is no well not at least at this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
answer is no well not at least at this
size<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.629> even<00:01:03.660> though<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> tablet

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
size you see even though a tablet

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
size you see even though a tablet
essentially<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> phone<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> large

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
essentially is a phone with a large

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
essentially is a phone with a large
screen<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.530> large<00:01:07.770> screen<00:01:08.159> makes<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
screen that large screen makes for a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.780 
screen that large screen makes for a
very<00:01:08.640> different<00:01:09.479> experience<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.790> these

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
very different experience and these

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.350 
very different experience and these
different<00:01:12.090> sizes<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.409> psychological

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
different sizes have some psychological

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
different sizes have some psychological
connections<00:01:15.360> along<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.439> let's<00:01:17.250> say

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
connections along with them let's say

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.130 
connections along with them let's say
for<00:01:17.640> standard<00:01:18.180> sake<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.689> video<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
for standard sake for this video that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
for standard sake for this video that
the<00:01:19.229> conventional<00:01:19.830> tablet<00:01:20.310> size<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.880> our

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the conventional tablet size in our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.210 
the conventional tablet size in our
heads<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.960> roughly<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.409> size<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> piece<00:01:23.189> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
heads is roughly the size of a piece of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
heads is roughly the size of a piece of
standard<00:01:24.060> printing<00:01:24.570> paper<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.630> makes

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
standard printing paper now this makes

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.730 
standard printing paper now this makes
sense<00:01:28.619> since<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> size<00:01:30.869> our<00:01:31.259> reports

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
sense since this is the size our reports

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.710 
sense since this is the size our reports
written<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> school<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:32.939> work<00:01:32.970> what

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
written on in school and at work what

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
written on in school and at work what
we're<00:01:33.900> used<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> writing<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> drawing<00:01:35.189> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
we're used to writing on a drawing on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.120 
we're used to writing on a drawing on
when<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.700> were<00:01:35.729> younger<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:38.009> our

when we were younger and and what our

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580 
when we were younger and and what our
laptop<00:01:38.729> screens<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.420> laptop<00:01:39.810> keyboards<00:01:40.439> are

laptop screens and laptop keyboards are
generally<00:01:41.159> sized<00:01:41.430> as<00:01:41.729> as<00:01:41.939> well<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
generally sized as as well so a lot of

generally sized as as well so a lot of
the<00:01:45.360> things<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:45.960> doing<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.530> these

the things that we're doing on these
tablets<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.610> things<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.970> we're<00:01:48.149> used<00:01:48.360> to
