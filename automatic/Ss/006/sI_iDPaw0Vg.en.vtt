a<00:02:32.880> mistake<00:02:33.030> he<00:02:33.420> actually<00:02:33.840> clumps<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.560> floppy

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
a mistake he actually clumps a floppy

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
a mistake he actually clumps a floppy
play<00:02:35.580> here<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.210> can<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> two<00:02:36.810> guard<00:02:37.080> and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
play here you can see the two guard and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.780 
play here you can see the two guard and
the<00:02:37.620> point<00:02:37.860> guard<00:02:38.070> would<00:02:38.220> convert<00:02:38.580> into<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the point guard would convert into the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.060 
the point guard would convert into the
pig<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> 4-peat<00:02:40.080> play<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
that's not enough time to develop I

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.070 
that's not enough time to develop I
realized<00:02:44.610> this<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.600> basketball<00:02:45.930> I
