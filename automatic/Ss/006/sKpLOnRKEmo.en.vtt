00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.059
 with the otherwise so peaceful tranquility at the Bleilochtalsperre it was on this 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.059
 Weekend not far 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:24.070
 Herrmann inflated the air there for two days, almost thinking of himself 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.359
 Schleizer triangle just that the fellows here on the land and the water 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.060
 were on the way 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 For the second time now in Saarburg Haubrok creates 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.170
 European Championship held 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.070
 A total of 60 starters from seven nations never came with their 50 hovercraft 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.530
 against each other 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.290
 in four races, the fastest was in six different classes 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 Driver to determine 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.560
 behind the scenes and under the hood of the hovercraft there was 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.970
 in the paddock 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.320
 here the houses Krafts were prepared for the race and waited yet how 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 These amphibious vehicles work exactly 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.370
 or does he mean 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.870
 he locked a hole in a chess piece of a childless brother 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.500
 Time in the pocket as really a pressure of air between the pockets of the waistband 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.050
 in the boat and the effect of the Alfa Romeo or used hole of a 15 centimeters 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 to float 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.260
 unfortunately past responsibilities up to 460 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.450
 and start from zero to one hundred in the region 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.700
 how fast the vehicles are on land and at sea 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 The visitors of the event were able to get an idea of â€‹â€‹this themselves 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.600
 On Saturday, RS 2000 attracted interested people to the racetrack Sunday 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.230
 weather less than half 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.420
 even if Peter, this one made a mistake for me 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.189
 So you appreciate this venue and not only because 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.530
 of the big reservoir 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.370
 the only opportunity at the moment in Germany or NL breakthrough 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.920
 because the couple Norman Arndt and everything from the top stay very friendly 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.220
 Countries are given that in the Bonau new bravo-calls 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 and in 2012 the hovercraft boats will return to Salzburg 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.130
 this time the event will be even bigger than the years before 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 because this is the world's best driver to determine
