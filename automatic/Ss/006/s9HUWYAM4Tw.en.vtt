00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 he immediately smears away that's that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.100
 also with a wet road too 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.810
 compare so clay soil but that is 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 rather black ice and that's why he has 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 even cup action also notes 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.500
 the sinking now everything is quiet that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 is the car in the scary difficult 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.670
 to keep in the track 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.640
 when switching I have in the field yet 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.560
 rather an automat because I'm there with it 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 can drive much more relaxed ge 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.880
 rural and does not have me with gas and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 Clutch Cancel 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.690
 it is much more comfortable with 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.560
 automatic transmission in terrain to drive 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 seems to give 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.090
 that is the only one demanding but the high 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.430
 But torque does it all 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.120
 Do not make up for something that does not have something 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.849
 off-road vehicle really 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.360
 definitely makes the moment in the terrain 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.660
 Of advantage because I am through torque 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.640
 just make the whole car easier to move 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.989
 I can not go over speed 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.940
 I do not have the speed band 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.099
 exploit but you have the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.940
 possibility in the lower speed range 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:38.019
 to get along well and around the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.019
 to bring power to the ground 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.010
 first gear she has to fight because just 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.690
 can reducers has because not 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 come down in another 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.870
 speed range and now problems here 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.130
 once the chamber lifted that he that he 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.470
 starts to spin 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.150
 it's enough that's enough 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.849
 big difference no 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.790
 terrain reduction is easy 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.079
 It is also difficult in terrain slow 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.310
 park on passages around the like 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.310
 neat was especially 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.269
 try here was the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.400
 to go uphill assistants 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.000
 he has a hard time with all kinds of trees 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.750
 we try to keep the car on the mountain 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.750
 let's go 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.850
 likes already goes out very fast 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.790
 So we have to regulate resp 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.600
 have to start again to be controlled 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.600
 to be able to drive backwards 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.760
 Mutu is fine 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.450
 the implementation would be in the car 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.990
 overall slower in 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.330
 Every single gang means that I am 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.480
 with much less effort, the 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.859
 vehicle much easier and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.859
 could control the terrain 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.370
 So the vehicle satisfied with security 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.340
 the purpose for which it really drove 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.380
 that's what kind of thing maybe driven 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.900
 even mini if you have HÃ¶rmann sitting 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.000
 one sensible but one has drifted 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.070
 meanwhile all this electronic 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.470
 Elk in the street also theirs 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.780
 make sense for that is the car with 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.150
 safety well constructed well built 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.970
 it's a nice interior so that 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.230
 All in all, car makes fun what is 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.230
 not this off-road vehicle
