 hi friends today let's dedicate my list 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.130
 channel again to talk about mini mushrooms 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.020
 that's good lately not stop 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.880
 those of mini zetas some for that we are 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.009
 the friendship specialists in villeta 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.619
 changers today we are going to talk about a 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.960
 new product that we already had I think that 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.360
 coming slightly different to maybe 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.140
 you've seen yourself it's about the mini 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.289
 set a bryce les lmr 03 the version with 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.780
 Brushless motor but 50th anniversary 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.730
 It takes already 50th anniversary of client that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.440
 bear 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.540
 let's open it so you can see 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.340
 contains the box is identical to the others 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.340
 the only difference is that here he puts in 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.780
 a small disinvited 50th anniversary I'm going 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 to zoom in 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.670
 5 and 0 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.880
 which includes a carton that includes 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.890
 includes some instructions 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.970
 I'm going to take it from my heart because I think 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 that this is also new 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.640
 and I just transport very nice 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.040
 the manual that is already coming is the same 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.320
 manual mini zmr 03 hours louis 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.320
 normal the box we leave here 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:35.930
 and take the car how it differs 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.550
 this car to the mini zm msr 03 normal then 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.159
 I will teach it closely because it only has 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.190
 three differences 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.510
 yes you chassis 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.760
 you can see different positions and I 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.050
 I already know that the most experts have seen 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.570
 things you already know things 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.810
 you have understood 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.820
 well bearings the car already comes 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.360
 settled in treatments for both 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.700
 front wheels as for the bench and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.130
 the rear differential you see that it's 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.200
 this bearing here the two that are going 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.060
 inside that you do not see at this moment and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.230
 the four that go on the wheels 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.709
 front 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.569
 change number one change number two 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.450
 rear differential the car is 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 it supplies as indifference the balls 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.710
 red color that is the color of 50 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.810
 anniversary of cheese 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:35.470
 and it's the good differential of cheese and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.420
 part number 3 is the contacts of the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.319
 chassis the chassis contacts so that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.499
 you see they are golden they are gold 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.380
 come in a gold bath so that it 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:54.140
 facilitate the contact of the batteries 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.420
 this is the one in my region 3 v 50 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.720
 identical anniversary to the previous model 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.250

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.410
 wide position 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.920
 you know that all the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.930
 pieces what is the lid what is the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.920
 shorter address bar to mount it 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.770
 in position 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.750
 narro in a narrow position and also we 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.320
 comes the engine bench fix that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.750
 comes in position nm 98 millimeters 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.380
 the bench rm comes to place it 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.260
 in 94 or 90 millimeters everything comes to us 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.660
 inside this bag with all the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.990
 pieces even then the key quote from 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.360
 famous nuts or what is the key to 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.330
 put and remove motor sprockets 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.550
 Well, that's all this comes to us 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.270
 little bag here that they call the starter 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.280
 pack 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.220
 they carry the battery clips for 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.680
 close the batteries the little button 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.350
 synchronize and in this case effectively 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.740
 the key to put and remove them 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.960
 wheel nuts comes a kit of 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.580
 pieces for the differential what are 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.110
 the O-rings that said 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.960
 differential the stop serving depressor 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.720
 as pieces 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.010
 let's say replacement in case we lose or 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.010
 we are crushed some piece 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.700
 by car we will leave it as it came 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.930
 I have placed and finally these pieces of 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.600
 here, as you can see, they are the h in 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.310
 m positions of the fabric piece that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.790
 goes below and does the suspension in 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.830
 plastic of course the thicknesses that 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.790
 they are put on the motor bed for 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.590
 remove or insert the engine to correct 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.440
 the position depending on the development 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.780
 that we carry and a different dock for 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.730
 the central suspension as you well know 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.340
 all these pieces are very nice but 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.810
 when we drive the cars and more this one 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 who are Brazilian and that it is about 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.910
 give him cane since all these pieces the 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.160
 we remove to put optional parts in 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.810
 aluminum in carbon fiber in others 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.710
 materials and that allow us things 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.420
 different 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.760
 but we wanted to teach in this version 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.650
 because now it is what is available and 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.900
 According to what he told us, that's what's going 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.300
 to have when someone wants to buy a 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.820
 complete chassis as it has to go through the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.710
 50th anniversary chassis will not get there 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.480
 of the moment so they say versions 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.430
 normal but they're going to get they 're going to 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.850
 get this version a little bit optional 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.310
 nothing else we are going to return it to its place and 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.940
 let's leave it as it was 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.850
