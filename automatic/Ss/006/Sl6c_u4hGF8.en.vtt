00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that was kind of unfortunate but couple

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
that was kind of unfortunate but couple
games<00:01:08.310> after<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.790> finally<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
games after I finally got it so here it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.730 
games after I finally got it so here it
is<00:01:11.030> assault<00:01:12.030> weapon<00:01:12.570> underground<00:01:13.200> took<00:01:13.500> me

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
three minutes 30 seconds I think which

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.690 
three minutes 30 seconds I think which
is<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.549> too<00:01:17.759> bad<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.450> assault<00:01:18.990> mode<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.700> not

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
is not too bad for assault mode but not

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
is not too bad for assault mode but not
even<00:01:20.970> too<00:01:21.119> great<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.689> let's<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.770> into<00:01:23.009> my

get your mode because you can see your

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.490 
get your mode because you can see your
enemies<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> Raider<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.810> actually<00:02:17.230> else

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
enemies on the Raider what actually else

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.870 
enemies on the Raider what actually else
we<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.370> Raider

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
we know about the Raider

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.610 
we know about the Raider
when<00:02:19.060> you<00:02:19.180> call<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.720> second<00:02:20.140> wave<00:02:20.410> II

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
when you call in the second wave II

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.089 
when you call in the second wave II
while<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.370> one<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.330> sky<00:02:22.599> already<00:02:23.099> you

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
while the one is in the sky already you

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.460 
while the one is in the sky already you
will<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.180> radar<00:02:25.420> refreshing<00:02:26.230> with

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
will see the radar refreshing with

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.160 
will see the radar refreshing with
enemies<00:02:27.220> faster<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.180> when<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.630> call<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
enemies faster but when you call in the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.740 
enemies faster but when you call in the
30<00:02:29.890> wavy<00:02:30.280> at<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> same<00:02:30.910> time<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.510> get<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
30 wavy at the same time you get a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.500 
30 wavy at the same time you get a
advanced<00:02:32.500> UAV<00:02:32.950> instead<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.940> that's<00:02:34.180> kind<00:02:34.390> of

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
advanced UAV instead so that's kind of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.509 
advanced UAV instead so that's kind of
cool<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.840> know<00:02:34.959> obviously<00:02:35.950> when<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.190> call<00:02:36.370> in

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
cool to know obviously when you call in

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.940 
cool to know obviously when you call in
the<00:02:36.700> for<00:02:37.239> few<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.810> at<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.230> era<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.739> get<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the for few a be at this era you get a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.449 
the for few a be at this era you get a
faster<00:02:39.519> advanced<00:02:40.510> UAV<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.709> that's<00:02:42.010> how<00:02:42.280> it

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
faster advanced UAV so that's how it

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.210 
faster advanced UAV so that's how it
works<00:02:42.730> after<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:43.870> got<00:02:44.110> my<00:02:44.350> move

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
works after I got my move

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.990 
works after I got my move
got<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.720> decent<00:02:46.720> score<00:02:47.200> at<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.560> end<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.920> think<00:02:48.000> 65

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
got a decent score at the end I think 65

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.650 
got a decent score at the end I think 65
and<00:02:49.450> eight<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.850> didn't<00:02:51.850> get<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> second<00:02:52.480> Mobe

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and eight but didn't get the second Mobe

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.470 
and eight but didn't get the second Mobe
so<00:02:53.019> think<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.370> game<00:02:54.549> play<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.239> one

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so think the game play with just one

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.440 
so think the game play with just one
