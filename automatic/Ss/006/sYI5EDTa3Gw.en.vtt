00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
length here in front of me so 20 inches

a<00:02:09.689> larger<00:02:10.689> size<00:02:10.899> gives<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.379> some<00:02:11.560> additional

a larger size gives you some additional

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
what makes it a pad that you do have to

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.369 
what makes it a pad that you do have to
blow<00:03:03.370> up<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:03.849> an<00:03:04.000> inflatable<00:03:04.359> pad<00:03:04.870> you've

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
blow up it's an inflatable pad you've

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.229 
blow up it's an inflatable pad you've
got<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.709> nozzle<00:03:06.190> right<00:03:06.220> here<00:03:06.430> at<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.970> upper

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
got the nozzle right here at the upper

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.149 
got the nozzle right here at the upper
end<00:03:07.389> of<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.720> pad<00:03:07.930> for<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.709> purpose

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
end of the pad for that purpose

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.420 
end of the pad for that purpose
certainly<00:03:09.909> you<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.180> blow<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.569> up<00:03:10.690> by<00:03:11.019> mouth

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
certainly you can blow it up by mouth

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.890 
certainly you can blow it up by mouth
takes<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.519> little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.909> of<00:03:13.030> time<00:03:13.239> but<00:03:13.540> not<00:03:13.720> an

takes a little bit of time but not an

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.129 
takes a little bit of time but not an
excessive<00:03:14.680> amount<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.459> energy<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.299> thermo

excessive amount of energy but thermo

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.939 
excessive amount of energy but thermo
rest<00:03:17.410> does<00:03:17.680> include<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.760> pump<00:03:19.449> sack<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.230> what

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
rest does include a pump sack so what

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.400 
rest does include a pump sack so what
you're<00:03:21.099> seeing<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.790> not<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:23.139> stuff

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
you're seeing here is not just the stuff

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.199 
you're seeing here is not just the stuff
sack<00:03:23.620> for<00:03:23.949> the<00:03:24.069> pad<00:03:24.250> though<00:03:24.669> it<00:03:24.819> serves<00:03:25.060> that

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
sack for the pad though it serves that

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.619 
sack for the pad though it serves that
purpose<00:03:25.329> certainly<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.769> also<00:03:27.099> is<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.879> pump<00:03:28.329> sack

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
purpose certainly it also is a pump sack

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.740 
purpose certainly it also is a pump sack
what<00:03:29.079> I<00:03:29.109> mean<00:03:29.349> by<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.590> there<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:31.120> nozzle

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
what I mean by that there is a nozzle

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.439 
what I mean by that there is a nozzle
attachment<00:03:32.319> right<00:03:33.220> here<00:03:33.489> at<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.760> bottom<00:03:34.269> of

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:34.449 
attachment right here at the bottom of

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.409 
attachment right here at the bottom of
that<00:03:35.109> sack<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:36.250> wraps<00:03:36.609> around<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.239> nozzle

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
that sack just wraps around the nozzle

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.119 
that sack just wraps around the nozzle
itself<00:03:38.109> and<00:03:39.389> you<00:03:40.389> fill<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.260> pump<00:03:41.590> sack<00:03:41.889> with

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
itself and you fill that pump sack with

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.979 
itself and you fill that pump sack with
air<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:44.410> use<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.690> introduce<00:03:46.690> air

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
air and you use that to introduce air

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.650 
air and you use that to introduce air
into<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.739> interior<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.879> sleeping<00:03:49.239> pad<00:03:49.389> if

into the interior of the sleeping pad if
you<00:03:49.720> don't<00:03:50.169> want<00:03:50.379> to<00:03:50.470> blow<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.859> you<00:03:50.889> use<00:03:51.280> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
you don't want to blow it up you use the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.330 
you don't want to blow it up you use the
pump<00:03:51.730> sack<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.629> do<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.349> save<00:03:53.709> yourself

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
pump sack to do that and save yourself

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.430 
pump sack to do that and save yourself
the<00:03:54.879> effort<00:03:54.909> and<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.389> energy<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.959> doing<00:03:56.290> that

the effort and the energy of doing that
