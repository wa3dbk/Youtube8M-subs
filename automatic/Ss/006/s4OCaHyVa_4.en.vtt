kilometers we then looked briefly at

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.820 
kilometers we then looked briefly at
where<00:00:51.970> that<00:00:52.239> water<00:00:52.540> came<00:00:53.050> from<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.470> split<00:00:53.710> it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
where that water came from and split it

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.530 
where that water came from and split it
evenly<00:00:54.160> between<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.760> Fountains<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.449> deep

that half of this water came from what

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.039 
that half of this water came from what
some<00:01:00.100> creationists<00:01:00.940> call<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.390> vapor<00:01:01.720> canopy

and<00:01:02.559> came<00:01:02.920> up<00:01:03.100> with<00:01:03.129> some<00:01:03.489> truly<00:01:03.879> staggering

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
and came up with some truly staggering
