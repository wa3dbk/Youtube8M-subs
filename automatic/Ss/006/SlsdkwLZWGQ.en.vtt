00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
of the other part of the shirt so it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.930 
of the other part of the shirt so it
just<00:02:13.900> looks<00:02:14.080> more<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> fun<00:02:14.800> tita<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.580> I'm

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
just looks more like a fun tita and I'm

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.790 
just looks more like a fun tita and I'm
taking<00:02:16.270> my<00:02:16.420> felt<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.930> black<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.470> white<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
taking my felt in black and white and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.650 
taking my felt in black and white and
cutting<00:02:18.100> out<00:02:18.220> cloud<00:02:18.490> shapes<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.060> hot<00:02:19.270> gluing

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
cutting out cloud shapes and hot gluing

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.720 
cutting out cloud shapes and hot gluing
goes<00:02:19.840> on<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.740> could<00:02:20.950> sell<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.580> more

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
goes on you could sell but it's more

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.700 
goes on you could sell but it's more
time<00:02:22.030> consuming<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.320> went<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
time consuming so I just went with the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.350 
time consuming so I just went with the
glue<00:02:23.950> gun<00:02:24.130> because<00:02:24.340> some<00:02:24.550> people<00:02:24.850> can't<00:02:25.090> sell

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
glue gun because some people can't sell

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.810 
glue gun because some people can't sell
and<00:02:25.600> then<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.590> wrote<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.890> word<00:02:27.010> ok<00:02:27.400> twice

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
and then I just wrote the word ok twice

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.600 
and then I just wrote the word ok twice
unto<00:02:28.420> my<00:02:28.540> shirt<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.920> that's<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.340> looks

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
unto my shirt so that's what it looks

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.490 
unto my shirt so that's what it looks
like<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.240> let<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.450> dry<00:02:31.570> for<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.110> little<00:02:32.170> bit

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
like and you let it dry for a little bit

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
like and you let it dry for a little bit
and<00:02:32.680> then<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:33.880> wear<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.900> just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and then you can wear it and I just

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.290 
and then you can wear it and I just
paired<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.500> with<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.680> skirt<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.220> some<00:02:36.580> basic

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
paired it with a skirt and some basic
