00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.440 
dragging and dropping it in the trash
bin<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.830> next<00:02:56.980> step<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.550> get<00:02:57.700> an<00:02:57.790> image<00:02:57.940> and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
bin so next step you get an image and

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.570 
bin so next step you get an image and
then<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.050> need<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> go<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.470> adjustments<00:02:59.680> and

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
then you need to go to adjustments and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.050 
then you need to go to adjustments and
then<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.420> need<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.660> go<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.960> channel<00:03:02.230> mixer

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
then you need to go to a channel mixer

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.630 
then you need to go to a channel mixer
so<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.900> output<00:03:05.110> channel<00:03:05.800> body<00:03:05.980> full<00:03:06.250> should

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
so the output channel body full should

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.740 
so the output channel body full should
show<00:03:07.060> red<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> source<00:03:09.760> channels<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.510> see

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
show red so source channels you can see

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.320 
show red so source channels you can see
red<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.350> hundred<00:03:12.070> percent<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.850> need<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.090> change

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
red a hundred percent you need to change

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.040 
red a hundred percent you need to change
that<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.630> zero<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.470> then<00:03:15.310> blue<00:03:15.640> 0%<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.870> need

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
source channel red you change it to one

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.130 
source channel red you change it to one
hundred<00:03:28.930> percent<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:30.239> blue<00:03:31.239> from<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.720> hundred

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
hundred percent and blue from a hundred

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
percent you change it to zero percent

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.479 
percent you change it to zero percent
right<00:03:34.930> now<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.170> colors<00:03:35.590> will<00:03:36.010> look<00:03:36.310> pretty

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
right now the colors will look pretty

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.479

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
weird but this is actually how it works

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.040 
weird but this is actually how it works
