00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 review of this book that is the club of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.769
 the lonely hearts as I told them 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.080
 in the previous video I got it in the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.340
 skin and they told me it was a book or they 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 I took that and without books I 'm a penny 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.070
 that is a girl they have 14 there are 14 and 15 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.769
 years which tells us that it is since 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.920
 It was very small and he met NeuquÃ©n and he's 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 the son of the friends of the parents should 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.290
 and then when when the friends of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 the penny lights come to visit them 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.219
 because they met and talked and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.719
 players and then little by little 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 as they were growing by phoenix they 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.320
 it can be like that an illusion 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 about the net about that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 they could be something that the love of their 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 life and things like that but good children 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.199
 wishing people who want and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 so start as you look for other 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.390
 things and in one of those that in neiva to 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.900
 visit ap 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.540
 Well, something happens but not with no 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.400
 compete then penny realizes and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.470
 he is running away his room looks 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.390
 angry and leaves sad then being 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 there in your room then start as a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.410
 tell children things that children 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.210
 are scum or that children just only 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.420
 they use them that children just want 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.060
 sex and continue where he says it 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.180
 will not go out with children until 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.530
 after leaving the of the couple that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 then already says here that not that she already 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.670
 will not go out with children and what 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.830
 because not already being there turns turns or 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.150
 wall and see a poster that is the poster of 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 the beatles and see what a name says in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.960
 the poster I do not know I do not know what it is but not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 I know it is but it's in English and it 's the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 lonely hearts club 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 Then, since he decides to do that, he decides 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 make club little by little this club is going 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.620
 earning like that popularity or something 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.540
 They have at school penny and past 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.580
 girls want to go to the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.390
 club and then the chavitas that go 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 entering the club they are counting as 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 a little bit of how the children have 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 suffered more but the problem is that 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.740
 penny knows a child that this boy then 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.990
 start as a 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.720
 make change of mind to penny about 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.450
 of them that not all children are 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.670
 bad but then there the problem that 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 penny did the club clerk in the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.510
 club then yes she starts walking with 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 the child then the girls of validity and 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.750
 those who go deep do not make you is the club 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.720
 and he's already dating a child later and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.910
 here begins to think to think about what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.730
 you have to do the truth me semis a 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.860
 book very yerli semis and like that very from 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.960
 girl but one and law four of five 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.340
 stars because I liked it though 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.410
 that I did not like is that at the beginning of 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.980
 book it is said tells you that penny 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.380
 know this child and when he meets him in 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.390
 the story you know who the child is and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.490
 you know how the book will end and 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.700
 so then that was like the only thing 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.680
 I do not like it that much, but if you 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.210

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.010
 like that joins romantic histoire not like that 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.930
 Well, everything you like is going to like this 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 so yes if you want to give 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.040
 opportunity then read it 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.049

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.420
