00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
moving on to a German design

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.450 
moving on to a German design
was<00:02:07.490> just<00:02:07.850> patent<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.780> new<00:02:09.110> idea<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:10.280> new

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
was just patent this new idea for new

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.670 
was just patent this new idea for new
concepts<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.210> planes<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.530> right

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
concepts of planes well here it is right

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
concepts of planes well here it is right
away<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.460> tell<00:02:13.670> there's<00:02:13.850> way<00:02:14.030> more<00:02:14.060> room

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
away you can tell there's way more room

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.150 
away you can tell there's way more room
in<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> middle<00:02:14.930> section<00:02:15.350> so<00:02:15.740> now<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:15.920> don't

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
in the middle section so now you don't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.500 
in the middle section so now you don't
have<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.310> wait<00:02:16.490> for<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.760> slow<00:02:16.970> person<00:02:17.270> in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
have to wait for that slow person in

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.940 
have to wait for that slow person in
front<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.930> instead<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.230> having<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:18.800> small

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
front of you instead of having two small

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.190 
front of you instead of having two small
aisles<00:02:19.610> why<00:02:19.820> not<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.210> one<00:02:20.510> large<00:02:20.750> one<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
aisles why not have one large one in the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.600 
aisles why not have one large one in the
middle<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> German<00:02:21.860> designer<00:02:22.160> believes<00:02:22.520> that

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
middle the German designer believes that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.830 
middle the German designer believes that
this<00:02:22.760> will<00:02:22.820> put<00:02:23.060> an<00:02:23.150> end<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.480> waste<00:02:23.720> of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
this will put an end to a waste of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
this will put an end to a waste of
queueing<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.770> off<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.550> plains<00:02:25.820> which

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
queueing on and off the plains which

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.730 
queueing on and off the plains which
essentially<00:02:26.570> means<00:02:26.930> there's<00:02:27.290> gonna<00:02:27.410> be<00:02:27.560> more

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
essentially means there's gonna be more

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.190 
essentially means there's gonna be more
flights<00:02:28.070> on<00:02:28.370> time<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.180> also<00:02:29.570> windows<00:02:29.870> are

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
flights on time and also windows are

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.140 
flights on time and also windows are
gonna<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.440> much<00:02:30.680> larger<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.640> ultimate

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
gonna be much larger for ultimate

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.940 
gonna be much larger for ultimate

on Mars well here it is this is what it

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.729 
on Mars well here it is this is what it

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
would look like if we colonized it if we

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.500 
would look like if we colonized it if we
were<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> live<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.250> Mars<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:40.820> probably<00:02:41.090> live<00:02:41.360> in
