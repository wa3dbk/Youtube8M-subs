first of all just imagine this they move
the<00:04:06.880> music<00:04:07.390> by<00:04:07.600> computer<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:09.250> they<00:04:09.430> do

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
the music by computer and what they do

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.260 
the music by computer and what they do
is<00:04:10.030> they<00:04:10.570> chop<00:04:10.900> off<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.470> highs<00:04:11.680> they<00:04:12.459> chop<00:04:12.970> off

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
is they chop off the highs they chop off

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.479 
is they chop off the highs they chop off
the<00:04:13.630> lows<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.230> then<00:04:14.770> they<00:04:14.950> compress

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
the lows and then they compress

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.620 
the lows and then they compress
everything<00:04:16.000> how<00:04:16.900> could<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.620> possibly<00:04:17.919> be

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
everything how could that possibly be

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.200 
everything how could that possibly be
equal<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.260> open<00:04:20.829> sound<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.790> get<00:04:22.060> on

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
equal to the open sound that you get on

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.630 
equal to the open sound that you get on
a<00:04:22.240> record<00:04:22.840> with<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.410> bases<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.340> highs

and the fullness in the middle I mean it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.610 
and the fullness in the middle I mean it
there's<00:04:27.850> no<00:04:28.090> comparison<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.810> would<00:04:29.050> keep
