was reading a book recently which
reminded<00:00:10.170> me<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.650> really<00:00:11.070> cool<00:00:11.429> study<00:00:11.820> on

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
reminded me of a really cool study on

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.230 
reminded me of a really cool study on
water<00:00:12.240> back<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> 1990s<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.150> wanted<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240

Emoto<00:00:33.780> came<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.290> with<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> brilliant<00:00:34.680> idea<00:00:35.250> of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
Emoto came up with a brilliant idea of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
Emoto came up with a brilliant idea of
freezing<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.960> observing<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> under<00:00:37.980> a

development<00:01:01.230> he<00:01:01.649> observed<00:01:02.070> these<00:01:02.280> beautiful

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
development he observed these beautiful

development he observed these beautiful
crystals<00:01:03.539> each<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.949> unique<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
crystals each one very unique and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.500 
crystals each one very unique and
amazing<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.510> their<00:01:06.630> own<00:01:06.810> special<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:08.210> well<00:01:09.210> he

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
amazing in their own special way well he

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810 
amazing in their own special way well he
thought<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.770> water<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> affected<00:01:11.790> by

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
thought so if this water is affected by

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
thought so if this water is affected by
its<00:01:12.180> environment<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.020> wonder<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.619> other

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
its environment I wonder what other

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.640 
its environment I wonder what other
things<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.250> doing<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.700> water<00:01:15.290> he<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.530> do

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
things are doing to water he then do

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
things are doing to water he then do
various<00:01:16.979> experiments<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> frozen<00:01:18.060> water

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
various experiments on the frozen water

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
various experiments on the frozen water
to<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:19.140> effects<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.740> were<00:01:19.860> actually

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to see what effects they were actually

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.270 
to see what effects they were actually
heavy<00:01:20.689> he<00:01:21.689> showed<00:01:21.930> various<00:01:22.350> words<00:01:22.680> pictures

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
heavy he showed various words pictures

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
heavy he showed various words pictures
played<00:01:24.150> some<00:01:24.330> music<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.140> even<00:01:25.320> prayed<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.100> the

played some music and even prayed to the
water<00:01:26.400> over<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.720> time<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.590> able<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
water over this time he was able to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.219 
water over this time he was able to
observe<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> water<00:01:30.180> crystals<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.020> each

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
observe that the water crystals and each

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.499 
observe that the water crystals and each
sample<00:01:31.950> again<00:01:32.280> changed<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> took<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.329> their
