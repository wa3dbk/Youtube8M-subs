like that so so it tends to go to the

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.309 
like that so so it tends to go to the
middle<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.370> third<00:02:24.730> beat<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.360> would<00:02:25.629> say<00:02:25.900> you

no<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.810> think<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.770> little<00:03:02.040> more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
no I think you can have a little more

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.340 
no I think you can have a little more
poise<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.020> your<00:03:04.170> d-down<00:03:05.450> body<00:03:06.450> may

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
poise like you know your d-down body may

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
poise like you know your d-down body may
you<00:03:07.739> continue<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.430> like<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.819> moment

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
you continue you know like that moment

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.370 
you continue you know like that moment
of<00:03:09.510> pause<00:03:10.319> be<00:03:11.280> very<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.090> meaningful<00:03:12.840> all

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
of pause be very you know meaningful all

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:41.500 
of pause be very you know meaningful all
right

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.899 

yeah<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.290> think<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:42.650> trick<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:42.920> don't<00:03:43.790> play

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
yeah I think the trick is don't play

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.210 
yeah I think the trick is don't play
these<00:03:44.120> two<00:03:44.330> notes<00:03:44.360> too<00:03:44.840> long<00:03:45.080> because<00:03:45.980> it

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
these two notes too long because it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.740 
these two notes too long because it
sounds<00:03:46.489> like<00:03:46.519> they're<00:03:46.790> connected<00:03:47.060> that's<00:03:47.510> why

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
sounds like they're connected that's why

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:57.600 
sounds like they're connected that's why
this<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:53.900> eighth<00:03:54.049> no<00:03:54.260> rest<00:03:54.590> must<00:03:54.769> be<00:03:54.950> absurd

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.629 

yeah<00:03:58.610> that's<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.599> is
