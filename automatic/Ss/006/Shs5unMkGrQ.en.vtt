00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
of the scale web Qian and for this this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
of the scale web Qian and for this this
one's<00:01:39.180> slightly<00:01:39.390> trickier<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> you've<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.580> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
one's slightly trickier so you've got a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.260 
one's slightly trickier so you've got a
bar<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.590> second<00:01:43.590> fret<00:01:43.830> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> top<00:01:45.060> two

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
strings and then with your little finger

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.290 
strings and then with your little finger
you've<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.530> put<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> fourth<00:01:50.130> fret<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
you've got to put the fourth fret on the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.350 
you've got to put the fourth fret on the
D<00:01:51.510> string<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.200> you've<00:01:52.320> got<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.180> you've

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
D string so you've got but then you've

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.970 
D string so you've got but then you've
got<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.690> sure<00:01:54.870> your<00:01:55.200> index<00:01:55.560> finger<00:01:55.890> has

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
got to make sure your index finger has

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.230 
got to make sure your index finger has
been<00:01:56.190> out<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.760> can<00:01:56.910> get<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.150> other

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
been out so you can get the other

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.530 
been out so you can get the other
strings<00:01:57.600> open<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> sounds<00:01:58.830> like<00:01:58.980> this

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
strings open so it sounds like this

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:08.030 
strings open so it sounds like this
rather<00:02:00.540> than<00:02:05.869> yes<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.080> got<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
rather than yes so you got that one and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.520 
rather than yes so you got that one and
then<00:02:08.160> keep<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.760> shape<00:02:09.320> you're<00:02:10.320> gonna

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
then keep in that shape you're gonna

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530 
then keep in that shape you're gonna
move<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:12.050> index<00:02:13.050> finger<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.470> two<00:02:13.680> frets<00:02:14.540> but

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
move your index finger up two frets but

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.960 
move your index finger up two frets but
your<00:02:15.750> little<00:02:15.959> finger<00:02:16.260> up<00:02:16.350> only<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.890> fret<00:02:17.310> or

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
your little finger up only one fret or

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.880 
your little finger up only one fret or
if<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.510> easier<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.170> replace<00:02:19.680> your

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
if it's easier you can replace your

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.910 
if it's easier you can replace your
little<00:02:20.100> finger<00:02:20.400> for<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.410> ring<00:02:22.410> finger<00:02:22.740> and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
little finger for the ring finger and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.199 
little finger for the ring finger and
that's<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.820> next<00:02:28.220> key<00:02:29.220> you're<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.970> so

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that's the next key you're in and so

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.280 
that's the next key you're in and so
that<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.330> barring<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.510> fourth<00:02:33.780> fret<00:02:34.110> on

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that is the barring the fourth fret on

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.920 
that is the barring the fourth fret on
the<00:02:34.380> top<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:34.739> strings<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.519> with<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.690> ring

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the top two strings and with your ring

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.710 
the top two strings and with your ring
finger<00:02:36.959> or<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:38.130> finger<00:02:38.430> doing<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.480> fifth

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
finger or little finger doing the fifth

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.520 
finger or little finger doing the fifth
fret<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> D<00:02:41.100> string<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.790> you've<00:02:41.910> got<00:02:42.530> again

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
fret on the D string so you've got again

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.930 
fret on the D string so you've got again
leaving<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.010> top<00:02:44.250> three<00:02:44.489> strings<00:02:44.790> open

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
leaving the top three strings open

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:55.780 
leaving the top three strings open
so<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> courts<00:02:47.960> so<00:02:48.140> far<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.920> as<00:02:55.460> you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
so the courts so far are which as you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.520 
so the courts so far are which as you
may<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.390> able<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.570> hear<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.020> start<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
may be able to hear as the start of the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.370 
may be able to hear as the start of the
chord<00:02:57.710> sequence<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:59.690> is<00:03:00.850> mostly<00:03:02.380> pretty

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
chord sequence and that is mostly pretty

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.780 
chord sequence and that is mostly pretty
much<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.890> chords<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.340> used<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
much all the chords that used in the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.870 
much all the chords that used in the
song<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.330> by<00:03:06.320> one<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.700> chord

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
song and by one and so the chord

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.640 
song and by one and so the chord
sequence<00:03:08.120> just<00:03:08.540> keeps<00:03:08.750> moving<00:03:09.020> around<00:03:09.380> those

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
sequence just keeps moving around those

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.310 
sequence just keeps moving around those
chords<00:03:10.130> really<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.900> main<00:03:12.080> chord

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
chords really so the main chord

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:27.370 
chords really so the main chord
sequences<00:03:13.120> which<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.240> your<00:03:14.420> first<00:03:14.660> chord

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.860 

so<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.400> cycles<00:03:29.000> around<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.270> same<00:03:29.480> cords

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
so it just cycles around the same cords

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:40.490 
so it just cycles around the same cords
basically<00:03:30.290> says<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.770> like

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.949 

and<00:03:41.500> yeah<00:03:42.430> that's<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.790> verse<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.450> haven't

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
and yeah that's the verse I haven't

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.600 
and yeah that's the verse I haven't
obviously<00:03:44.050> I'm<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.470> rushing<00:03:44.920> for<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.400> but

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
obviously I'm just rushing for it but

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.530 
obviously I'm just rushing for it but
you<00:03:45.819> can<00:03:46.000> pause<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.110> replay<00:03:47.230> whoever<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:49.000> the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
you can pause and replay whoever and the

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.730 
you can pause and replay whoever and the
bridge<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.640> using<00:03:51.640> these<00:03:51.760> same<00:03:52.000> chords<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.740> bit

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
bridge is using these same chords a bit

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.590 
bridge is using these same chords a bit
starting<00:03:54.280> on<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:56.650> minus<00:03:57.610> six<00:03:57.790> chord<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.420> that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
starting on the minus six chord so that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.380 
starting on the minus six chord so that
a<00:03:58.840> minor<00:03:59.140> or<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.860> b-flat<00:04:01.380> minor<00:04:02.380> six<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:02.890> beef

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
a minor or in b-flat minor six of beef

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.320 
a minor or in b-flat minor six of beef
beef<00:04:04.390> oh<00:04:06.480> yeah<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.780> chord

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:22.720 

and<00:04:11.510> then<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.140> goes<00:04:12.320> to<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:17.260> and<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:22.580> it's

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
and then it goes to the and then so it's

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.880 
and then it goes to the and then so it's
just<00:04:22.910> easy<00:04:23.600> moving<00:04:23.960> around<00:04:24.170> this<00:04:24.350> cause<00:04:24.560> again

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
just easy moving around this cause again

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:39.670 
just easy moving around this cause again
so<00:04:25.130> it's<00:04:25.250> like

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:50.100 

and<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.700> goes<00:04:41.880> back<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.540> first<00:04:42.720> bit

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.760 

so<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.650> is<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.009> verse<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.610> bridge<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.710> I'm

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
so that is the verse and bridge so I'm

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.830 
so that is the verse and bridge so I'm
sure<00:04:53.949> you<00:04:54.069> can<00:04:54.190> work<00:04:54.340> that<00:04:54.520> out<00:04:54.639> and<00:04:57.659> the<00:04:58.659> way<00:04:58.810> I

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
sure you can work that out and the way I

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.189 
sure you can work that out and the way I
play<00:04:59.409> it<00:05:02.069> in<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.310> intro<00:05:03.729> is<00:05:04.090> kind<00:05:04.659> of<00:05:04.810> tricky<00:05:05.020> I

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
play it in the intro is kind of tricky I

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.580 
play it in the intro is kind of tricky I
guess<00:05:05.409> one<00:05:05.680> until<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:06.280> get<00:05:06.430> used<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.699> it<00:05:06.879> but

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
guess one until you get used to it but

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.580 
guess one until you get used to it but
the<00:05:08.590> main<00:05:08.800> riff<00:05:09.099> in<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.400> song<00:05:10.199> it's<00:05:11.199> played<00:05:11.409> on

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
the main riff in the song it's played on

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.260 
the main riff in the song it's played on
one<00:05:11.770> guitar<00:05:12.129> part<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.580> then<00:05:12.699> these<00:05:12.879> chords

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
one guitar part and then these chords

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.640 
one guitar part and then these chords
are<00:05:13.360> played<00:05:13.389> on<00:05:13.539> another<00:05:13.930> guitar<00:05:14.289> part<00:05:14.530> and

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
are played on another guitar part and

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.760 
are played on another guitar part and
what<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:14.800> just<00:05:14.860> do<00:05:15.129> is<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.400> just<00:05:15.639> played<00:05:16.560> both<00:05:17.560> of

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
what I just do is I just played both of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.409 
what I just do is I just played both of
those<00:05:17.860> parts<00:05:18.280> at<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.400> same<00:05:18.490> time<00:05:18.849> so<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.270> main

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
those parts at the same time so the main

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:27.530 
those parts at the same time so the main
riff<00:05:19.659> is<00:05:19.840> like

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:36.410 

and<00:05:28.230> so<00:05:28.410> I'm<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.920> LC<00:05:29.280> Dakota<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:36.300> I'm

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
and so I'm just in LC Dakota and so I'm

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.760 
and so I'm just in LC Dakota and so I'm
just<00:05:36.450> playing<00:05:36.810> about<00:05:37.080> at<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.290> same<00:05:37.500> time

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
just playing about at the same time

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.450 
just playing about at the same time
which<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:37.980> weird

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
which is weird

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.300 
which is weird
yeah<00:05:39.620> fingers<00:05:40.620> on<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.830> right<00:05:40.860> hand<00:05:41.190> I've<00:05:41.280> got

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
yeah fingers on the right hand I've got

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:57.510 
yeah fingers on the right hand I've got
blue<00:05:41.550> two<00:05:41.760> different<00:05:42.300> rhythms<00:05:42.690> cuz<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:47.180> sorry

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.339 

that's<00:05:58.240> kind<00:05:58.449> of<00:05:58.509> weird

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.869 

but<00:06:05.349> that<00:06:05.590> doesn't<00:06:05.979> matter<00:06:06.129> too<00:06:06.370> much<00:06:06.400> I<00:06:06.759> mean

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
but that doesn't matter too much I mean

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.580 
but that doesn't matter too much I mean
if<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.150> can<00:06:07.300> just<00:06:07.330> play<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.960> chords<00:06:08.319> on<00:06:08.439> that

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
if you can just play the chords on that

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:17.300 
if you can just play the chords on that
bit<00:06:08.740> it's<00:06:08.889> fine<00:06:09.129> just<00:06:09.159> doing

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.650 

and<00:06:17.970> say<00:06:18.180> um
