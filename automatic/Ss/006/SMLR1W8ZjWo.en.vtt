00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 notice that rice happens to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.600
 tremendously that feeds millions to 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.179
 day around the world in the basic source 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 of the Far East would be 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.840
 any sane guy healthy type 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 completely where it has been dedicated 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.500
 much of the disease they do not 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.390
 they encounter problems as day of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.520
 I think now let's say cancer as 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.119
 us and because they keep taking 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 classic natural rice as it should be 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.250
 notice that the harvard university 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 He did a study among 40,000 men and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 157 thousand women and gave them during a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 period of four years was quite 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 exhaustive the study eating let's say 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 certain amounts of rice the rice 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 white that everyone consumes a dial and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 finally some were prone and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.230
 sebas declared type 2 diabetes look at 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 I change those who did not have it as 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.120
 part of their diet was consumed once a 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.239
 the week others who changed it for not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.129
 integrate no but no problem 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.899
 the rice as we see it has been 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 removed the shell let's say from 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 protection that this serial has and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 We finally got the rice as Juan said 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.790
 jose is practically pure starch that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 the body 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.040
 It's a lot to be able to process much more 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 vote it and finally it takes root in the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.120
 stomach and creates a quantity of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.370
 problems that you have to see first of 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.380
 acidity and obviously stagnates let's say 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.300
 to finally generate all kinds of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.800
 evils that the list is practically 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.850
 endless made the differences of 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.040
 kiss one can find the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.260
 supermarket of the vast majority of the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.700
 range of rices that exist or that 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.880
 find and they always fluctuate in a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.470
 price very similar to the one that jumps to the one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.540
 it's beneficial and we're all talking 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 since one that costs you 800 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 pesos another you're worth like three lucas and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.330
 mean exactly but note that when 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 one is going to eat Japanese food 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.660
 example and find this rice that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.229
 many times it is white gold have 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.619
 agglutinated true but it is very tasty or 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.869
 be equal no no it is not melted the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.360
 rice but you notice every granite but 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.220
 the same as the rest is because they wash it 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.509
 many times if you are the example 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.100
 you want to do exactly what you start with 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.930
 the little hand in a pot and then the 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 school you realize that a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.069
 milky liquid three verses that cursen 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.319
 starches 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.090
 coated that would ensure it more in fact 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.310
 see how my house does a lot 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.200
 integral season who relieved are the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.299
 things when I talked a little bag of 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.030
 rice I do not have to eat in two days 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.459
 but if I save it by very much donation 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.230
 basin be moth the shot does not reach 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.200
 the insects as is the white rice yo 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.639
 I leave it has two risks in governing 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.849
 for sanz the quality of food does not 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:38.099
 perishable 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.109
 good the brown rice does not last you if 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.919
 could go all the bugs inscription 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.480
 of it and nobody has to have 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.459
 natural food there was a commercial ago 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.199
 a long time ago with a brand of rum 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.530
 this valley where a person who 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.780
 washed with a brush that are 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 doing but then a way to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.900
 able to eat the white rice that 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.730
 we know toxic we go up all is 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.739
 washing the several is several times by 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.349
 at least there you already guarantee that you 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.629
 remove the starch that very strong say 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.669
 as a chemical element in the body without 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:14.509
 But I would tell you that the best would be 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:17.509
 in switching to integral rust and in 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.509
 Thai 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.949
 who make this shell is not much 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.540
 more expensive to remove the entire shell not the 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.159
 loses but the properties for the by 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.720
 the cover finally looks like the 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.310
 shell of horror no more but 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.439
 obviously does not bring all the source 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.120
 food in its natural form brings 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.220
 you know take something integral 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.509
 organically you feel completely 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.269
 a position of nutrients on the contrary 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:44.129
 they untie and therefore they are more than 1100 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.220
 millions of human beings who have more 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.750
 of 5 thousand in the record has made a 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.729
 structure and a red current culture 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.720
 but rice washed from the rock where not 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.180
 exactly 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.560
 and eye the rice action to your control it 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.840
 it got a lot of fact a lot of people 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.090
 but like what fattening rice ok 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.310
 integral not the brown rice processes it 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.930
 everything occupies serves that has distributed 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.879
 in the body with all the benefits 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.250
 that carries and finally keeps you 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.680
 like a rake absolutely and also 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.719
 obviously you have not only these 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.310
 properties as the lender is called 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:19.060
 of crashed in those that are barrier 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.060
 Exactly is antioxidant
