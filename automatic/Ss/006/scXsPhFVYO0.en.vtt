 your stand that is it can be 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.500
 for example it should be volume 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.219
 so it could be for example 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.039

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.489

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.430

 wrap in this decorative fabric 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.660
 you need to wrap it carefully because
