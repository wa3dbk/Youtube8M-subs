 fucking present anyway you talk about combos 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.310
 in which 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.590
 the first quadrant 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.890

 values ​​anyway 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.539
 change 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:35.669
 second 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.889
 x tricks on the phone 7 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.469
 example 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.279
 work 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.500
 the cpu however but decreases 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.890
 so I would say that anyway 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.280
 and online fox for me very very original compared to the others who 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.609
 present simple 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.659
 animations 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.789
 an end in itself done this 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.509
 however wind city for information 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.079
 enough system 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.079

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.959
 htc sense 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.329
 however it seems 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.849
 but coup for very very heavy indeed 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.039
 say that an example is also rent 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.640
 even if it seems now 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 dan cooler. 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.069
 it seemed more fluid 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.209
 because however the use of ct cpu holidays with the fractions also you it 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.739
 scroll is on the balls 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.459

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.539
 only by purchasing 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:57.649

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.169
 fifa offers 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.369

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.439
 and then Genoa 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.120

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.979
