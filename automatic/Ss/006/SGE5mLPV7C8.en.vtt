00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.330
 all these people 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.259
 street governor jorge lacerda in the neighborhood 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.300
 of the old in a traffic jam 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:34.370
 So many people ask how I 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 I'm going to drive the car in a traffic jam. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.650
 or as very slow traffic in this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 moment here you perceive everybody 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:50.090
 stopped the car does not ride at a speed 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.350
 constant what we have here in my 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 aquino speedometer marks two 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.329
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.809
 then for these situations the first 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 always because the speed 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.020
 of first gear in the first is just to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.009
 leaving with the car is 0 to 20 kilometers 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.800
 per hour 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.619
 you realize that here the traffic is not 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.820
 walk and walk very little 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.899
 then it is the first gear brake and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.930
 the clutch will control the brake to 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.200
 be able to keep up with this speed or 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.540
 lack of speed of cars stepping on 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.899
 Clear clutch stepping onto the car 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.000
 die if you're the only one here in this 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.189
 speed traffic situation 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.979
 extremely irregular 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.439
 the car only half or he dies 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.979
 then in this situation increased 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.110
 here also clutch why why I 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.229
 I can not stop over the range 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.540
 then I will first march taking 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 There is only time to give it to just 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.829
 first without foot in the clutch 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.750
 every time braking is stopped first 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:15.450
 clutch then the guard can show 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.290
 here in the traffic jam here 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.290
 cool 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.850
 Here for me, there's a sign and two of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.730
 preferential right there in the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.370
 preferably the preference that is not 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.130
 My but a certain moment arrives. 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.660
 that we're going to have to negotiate this 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 prefer to negotiate the entry because the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.570
 queue her funnel to come one lane only then 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:49.300
 always look in the rearview mirror 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:54.190
 life in the rearview mirror is a matter of 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.420
 negotiate even as the other driver 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.580
 another driver 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.500
 O has stopped place for me there is not 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.560
 its been up the band had to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.290
 wait for the front colleague and then 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 People are going to not stop over the band. 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.650
 pedestrian always looking in the rearview mirror 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.210
 the time to join because of your 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.690
 side may be coming 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:24.610
 The motorcyclist is the largest and 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.110
 thus returning to the question of 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:32.740
 speed is at this speed here 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:37.290
 First gear takes to bring order 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:41.620
 the pilot's constant pedal and beauty 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.340
 now if you do not put your foot in the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 clutch only to stabilize the car 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.570
 but they Keyhan O that gives increased 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.880
 to take a second step on the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.880
 accelerator as it is stepping on a 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.210
 egg shell that in this moment you 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.730
 find a fixed point on the 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.180
 acceleration of a constant speed 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.200
 for the car but always attentive to 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.710
 stops 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.340
 tÃ¡ us back there with personal tips 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.340
 and more
