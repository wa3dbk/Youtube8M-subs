00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.020 
it they're minor problems but there are
problems<00:01:27.649> the<00:01:28.399> first<00:01:28.550> thing<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:28.790> don't<00:01:28.850> like

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
problems the first thing I don't like

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.930

about<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.450> is<00:01:29.750> this<00:01:30.680> rope<00:01:30.890> right<00:01:30.950> here<00:01:31.100> it's

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
about it is this rope right here it's

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.139 
about it is this rope right here it's
very<00:01:32.000> thin<00:01:32.540> just<00:01:33.530> feels<00:01:33.830> cheap<00:01:34.220> it's<00:01:34.550> starting

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
very thin just feels cheap it's starting

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.190 
very thin just feels cheap it's starting
to<00:01:36.610> split<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.729> me<00:01:37.880> back<00:01:38.060> up<00:01:38.300> tied<00:01:38.509> knots<00:01:38.869> a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
to split on me back up tied knots a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.560 
to split on me back up tied knots a
couple<00:01:39.800> times<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:40.820> not<00:01:41.210> going<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.450> last

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
couple times and it's not going to last

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.910 
couple times and it's not going to last
very<00:01:41.750> long<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.290> I'll<00:01:42.380> get<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.680> replaced

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
very long so I'll get this replaced

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.640 
very long so I'll get this replaced
eventually<00:01:44.140> something<00:01:45.140> else<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.409> don't<00:01:45.560> like

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
eventually something else I don't like

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.130 
eventually something else I don't like
about<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.750> these<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.470> lines<00:01:48.710> right<00:01:49.010> here

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
about it is these the lines right here

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.120 
about it is these the lines right here
they're<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.170> bit<00:01:51.350> thicker<00:01:51.560> than<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.860> which<00:01:52.010> is

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
they're a bit thicker than this which is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.070 
they're a bit thicker than this which is
good<00:01:52.400> however<00:01:53.030> they<00:01:53.330> aren't<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:53.659> long<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:53.990> I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
good however they aren't as long as I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.060 
good however they aren't as long as I
would<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.290> them<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.470> be<00:01:54.530> they're<00:01:54.799> pretty

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
would like them to be they're pretty

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.039 
would like them to be they're pretty
long<00:01:55.220> but<00:01:55.460> as<00:01:55.549> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.760> see<00:01:55.820> from<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:56.720> tree

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
long but as you can see from this tree

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.460 
long but as you can see from this tree
all<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.500> way<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:57.950> tree<00:01:58.220> down<00:01:58.369> there<00:01:59.470> I've

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
all the way to that tree down there I've

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.910 
all the way to that tree down there I've
had<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.890> tie<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.869> rope<00:02:02.869> on<00:02:03.110> here<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:03.830> I

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
had to tie this rope on here just so I

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.179 
had to tie this rope on here just so I
could<00:02:04.330> tie<00:02:05.330> these<00:02:05.540> here<00:02:05.840> because<00:02:06.290> if<00:02:06.830> that

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
could tie these here because if that

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.180 
could tie these here because if that
makes<00:02:07.369> any<00:02:07.490> sense<00:02:07.729> at<00:02:07.939> all<00:02:08.830> they<00:02:09.830> won't<00:02:10.040> fall

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
makes any sense at all they won't fall

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.710 
makes any sense at all they won't fall
there<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.549> rotten<00:02:11.060> tree<00:02:11.209> because<00:02:11.570> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
there on the rotten tree because the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.259 
there on the rotten tree because the
line<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.200> too<00:02:12.410> short

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
line is too short

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.740 
line is too short
getting<00:02:14.269> into<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.769> pretty<00:02:15.769> easy

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
getting into it pretty easy

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:24.720 
getting into it pretty easy
down<00:02:16.870> here<00:02:20.430> climb<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.500> get<00:02:23.500> back<00:02:23.650> down<00:02:23.730> one

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
down here climb in and get back down one

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.220 
down here climb in and get back down one
