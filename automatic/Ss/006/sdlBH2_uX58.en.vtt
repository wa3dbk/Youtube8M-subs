00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello how are you here a new creepy 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.080
 pasta made by me about pokemon so 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.179
 let's start this is the last straw 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 All you humans are the worst 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.900
 that exists in this world 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.940
 I bet you do not even know why in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 I say it 's fine I'll tell you so 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 have an idea of ​​what awaits you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 you coaches that only 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.220
 little children I went on a trip with a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.080
 companion pokemon and they go out in search of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 more pokémons but what about the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 pokémons that do not work so much for a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.869
 battle or they can be given another use 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 more convenient for humans than 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.309
 entertain them in a fight simply 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 they use them to eat their meat like that 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.540
 because you need meat but the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.370
 they get out of the pokémons which are not 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 useful for your entertainment to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.570
 draw his fame through force and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.489
 fight of the pokémons now many that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.739
 hear this you will wonder why I do 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.629
 this or why he thought in this way the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.270
 answer is simple I had a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.039
 coach alone that my coach was not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 of those who are interested in winning leagues or 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 have fighting rather we were dedicated 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.239
 to hunt pokémons especal is that they were 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.070
 especially big ones that had a lot 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.600
 meat one day like any other 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.549
 we found a magic 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 my coach called him a lot 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.140
 attention so we went behind him he 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.060
 He got into his boat and we chased him from 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.369
 our point of view you could see that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 I was hurt with time we got to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 some caves where he hid there 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 I went in and I moved away from my 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 coach since there were many rocks by 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.049
 what he should be careful when 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.909
 I finally managed to corral the magical when 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 I finally against the wall he told me 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.170
 wait do not do it I know I'm not very 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.539
 useful in fight but I know I do not want to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.759
 finish as a meal I stayed a little 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.560
 missed then in the distance I could hear a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.289
 scream from my coach which said 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.390
 attack him and so I did then he released 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.100
 he knew what the ball was and he got caught in me 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.350
 mind kept thinking about what I 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 had said I always had doubt that well my 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.850
 coach with those pokémons and where 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.220
 they went so that night I managed to get out 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.530
 of my poke ball without my coach being 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 I realized and I followed him gave a 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.759
 poke ball to other people and in return 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 they gave him some money I 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.110
 he kept asking me so I decided 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.539
 follow shortly after they got into 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.030
 a quarter after a while I got myself 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.470
 I felt very bad in that room 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.080
 very cold everything was 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.360
 ice cream and it was also very dark then 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.790
 of that and a scream that said a charizar 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.190
 and the lights went on when that 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.380
 it happened I could not believe what I had seen 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.990
 they were skinned dead pokémons 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.060
 hung from a hook on the roof and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.820
 there were also tables there were parts of 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.580
 pokémons mutilated after in some 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.040
 walls there were pokemon schemes where 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.350
 there were instructions on how to cut them and 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.750
 which part of the body served more in that 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.520
 moment I understood all this time the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.040
 meat that I have seen humans eat 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.050
 Pokemon pokémons have been 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.209
 I helped to get in that moment 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.810
 some humans tried to attack me so 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.180
 I killed them 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.770
 after that I got out of there and escaped 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.050
 forest I have not seen my 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.390
 coach but after much meditating 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.390
 I decided it was time to balance the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.880
 things as well as you hunt pokémons I 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.890
 I will marry human trainers which is 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.959
 simpler because almost all 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.760
 coaches that I meet are kids 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.780
 of 10 years that call themselves 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.780
 pocket trainers
