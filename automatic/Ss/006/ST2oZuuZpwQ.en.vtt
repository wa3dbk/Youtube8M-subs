opinion<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:21.160> as<00:00:21.400> important<00:00:22.210> it's<00:00:22.360> not<00:00:22.480> more

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
opinion is as important it's not more

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.720 
opinion is as important it's not more
important<00:00:23.080> than<00:00:23.200> power<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.800> think<00:00:24.340> a<00:00:24.490> lot<00:00:24.700> of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
important than power I think a lot of

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.550 
important than power I think a lot of
rec<00:00:25.030> players<00:00:25.270> spend<00:00:25.570> time<00:00:25.750> trying<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.110> boom<00:00:26.380> it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
rec players spend time trying to boom it

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.920 
rec players spend time trying to boom it
and<00:00:26.770> get<00:00:26.920> faster<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.610> miles<00:00:28.240> per<00:00:28.449> hours<00:00:28.780> what

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
and get faster and miles per hours what

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.430 
and get faster and miles per hours what
they're<00:00:29.080> after

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.440 
they're after

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.729 
they're after
but<00:00:29.920> really<00:00:30.160> if<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.400> can<00:00:30.550> make<00:00:30.850> the<00:00:30.970> other<00:00:31.000> guy

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
but really if you can make the other guy

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.559 
but really if you can make the other guy
his<00:00:32.739> weaker<00:00:33.160> side<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:34.120> can<00:00:34.300> do<00:00:34.390> that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:34.569 
his weaker side you can do that

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:36.720 
his weaker side you can do that
regularly<00:00:35.109> that's<00:00:36.039> going<00:00:36.219> to<00:00:36.280> be<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.399> huge

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
regularly that's going to be a huge

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.849 
regularly that's going to be a huge
pickup<00:00:37.089> think<00:00:37.809> of<00:00:37.899> it<00:00:37.989> this<00:00:38.079> way<00:00:38.140> most<00:00:38.559> players

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
pickup think of it this way most players

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:40.229 
pickup think of it this way most players
over<00:00:39.219> there<00:00:39.370> if<00:00:39.519> there<00:00:39.670> are<00:00:39.760> three<00:00:39.999> five

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
over there if there are three five

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.689 
over there if there are three five
player<00:00:40.539> for<00:00:40.839> example<00:00:41.289> not<00:00:41.829> all<00:00:41.890> your<00:00:42.219> their

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
player for example not all your their

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.700 
player for example not all your their
shots<00:00:42.969> are<00:00:43.179> three<00:00:43.839> five<00:00:44.050> so<00:00:44.260> they<00:00:44.409> may<00:00:44.530> have<00:00:44.559> a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
shots are three five so they may have a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.430 
shots are three five so they may have a
four<00:00:45.190> oh<00:00:45.219> four<00:00:45.519> hand<00:00:45.789> in<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.329> 300<00:00:46.659> backhand<00:00:47.170> and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
four oh four hand in a 300 backhand and

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.069 
four oh four hand in a 300 backhand and
a<00:00:47.530> 300<00:00:48.489> volley<00:00:48.699> or<00:00:49.030> whatever<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.510> our<00:00:49.659> job<00:00:49.899> is

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
a 300 volley or whatever so our job is

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.229 
a 300 volley or whatever so our job is
to<00:00:50.109> find<00:00:50.469> it<00:00:50.679> and<00:00:50.920> then<00:00:51.399> start<00:00:51.729> to<00:00:51.850> point<00:00:51.999> out

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
to find it and then start to point out

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.910 
to find it and then start to point out
there<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:53.170> way<00:00:53.319> you<00:00:53.379> would<00:00:53.589> get<00:00:53.710> more

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
there so the way you would get more

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.889 
there so the way you would get more
accurate<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.940> your<00:00:55.089> serve<00:00:55.299> the<00:00:55.510> quick<00:00:55.690> answer

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
accurate and your serve the quick answer

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.079 
accurate and your serve the quick answer
is<00:00:56.049> to<00:00:56.260> practice<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:57.069> can't<00:00:57.249> just<00:00:57.460> always

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
is to practice it you can't just always

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.189 
is to practice it you can't just always
practice<00:00:58.479> power<00:00:58.690> you<00:00:58.839> got<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.049> practice

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
practice power you got to practice

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.410 
practice power you got to practice
accuracy<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.459> we<00:01:00.609> have<00:01:00.729> a<00:01:00.760> little<00:01:00.909> targeting

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
accuracy so we have a little targeting

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.270 
accuracy so we have a little targeting
system<00:01:01.839> here<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.019> we<00:01:02.229> use<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.620> per<00:01:02.829> not<00:01:03.069> real

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
system here that we use is per not real

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.969 
system here that we use is per not real
complicated<00:01:04.269> but<00:01:04.360> it's<00:01:04.540> good<00:01:04.690> too<00:01:04.870> for<00:01:05.080> our

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
complicated but it's good too for our

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.160 
complicated but it's good too for our
kids<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.430> everybody<00:01:06.729> understands<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.390> so<00:01:07.840> if

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
kids that everybody understands it so if

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.749 
kids that everybody understands it so if
you<00:01:08.259> look<00:01:08.409> at<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.649> areas<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.250> got<00:01:09.399> over<00:01:09.670> there

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
you look at the areas I got over there

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.149 
you look at the areas I got over there
Marty<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.119> got<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.990> far<00:01:11.229> out<00:01:11.439> wide<00:01:11.799> and<00:01:11.829> the

in the deuce Corp we're going to call
that<00:01:14.289> one<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.159> we're<00:01:15.280> just<00:01:15.369> going<00:01:15.579> to<00:01:15.640> move<00:01:15.820> to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
that one and we're just going to move to

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.179 
that one and we're just going to move to
the<00:01:16.149> side<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.170> right<00:01:17.439> so<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.920> middle

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
the side to the right so the middle

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.660 
the side to the right so the middle
there<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.490> two<00:01:18.759> then<00:01:19.630> three<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.649> area<00:01:21.430> four

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
there is two then three and area four

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.480 
there is two then three and area four
five<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.240> six<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:23.259> that's<00:01:23.469> not<00:01:23.770> real<00:01:24.130> tricky

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
five and six so that's not real tricky

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.279 
five and six so that's not real tricky
in<00:01:24.579> it<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.789> itself<00:01:25.060> but<00:01:25.270> those<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.570> just<00:01:25.600> our

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
in it of itself but those are just our

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.130 
in it of itself but those are just our
areas<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:26.740> we're<00:01:26.890> targeting<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.930> game

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
areas that we're targeting so the game

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.480 
areas that we're targeting so the game
I'm<00:01:29.289> going<00:01:29.409> to<00:01:29.469> show<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.890> do<00:01:30.039> this<00:01:30.189> and<00:01:30.429> to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
I'm going to show you to do this and to

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.219 
I'm going to show you to do this and to
kind<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.820> get<00:01:31.119> better<00:01:31.359> at<00:01:31.600> your<00:01:31.840> at<00:01:32.020> serve

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
kind of get better at your at serve

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.840 
kind of get better at your at serve
accuracy<00:01:32.740> it's<00:01:32.950> called<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.250> serve<00:01:33.460> number

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
accuracy it's called the serve number

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.910 
accuracy it's called the serve number
game<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.929> serve<00:01:35.079> number<00:01:35.350> game<00:01:35.530> is<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.679> way

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
game so the serve number game is a way

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.679 
game so the serve number game is a way
to<00:01:35.979> go<00:01:36.340> for<00:01:36.520> accuracy<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.119> also<00:01:37.270> try<00:01:37.630> to

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
to go for accuracy and also try to

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.870 
to go for accuracy and also try to
actually<00:01:37.929> get<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:38.859> score<00:01:39.219> so<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.460> can<00:01:39.609> see<00:01:39.789> if

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
actually get a score so you can see if

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.609 
actually get a score so you can see if
you<00:01:39.969> do<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.179> under<00:01:40.299> pressure<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.229> what's<00:01:41.469> going

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
you do it under pressure so what's going

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.080 
you do it under pressure so what's going
to<00:01:41.649> happen<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.100> I'm<00:01:42.250> going<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.429> start<00:01:42.609> serving

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
to happen is I'm going to start serving

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910 
to happen is I'm going to start serving
two<00:01:43.179> area<00:01:43.479> one<00:01:43.750> in<00:01:43.960> that<00:01:44.049> little<00:01:44.380> third<00:01:44.710> of

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
two area one in that little third of

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.520 
two area one in that little third of
that<00:01:45.039> box<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.329> make<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.289> get<00:01:47.439> to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
that box and if I make it then I get to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.620 
that box and if I make it then I get to
go<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.710> area<00:01:48.039> two<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.579> three<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.299> four<00:01:49.390> and

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
go to area two and three and four and

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.779 
go to area two and three and four and
you<00:01:50.140> know<00:01:50.229> until<00:01:50.380> I'm<00:01:50.499> all<00:01:50.649> done<00:01:50.859> but<00:01:51.369> I<00:01:51.429> can't

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
you know until I'm all done but I can't

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.880 
you know until I'm all done but I can't

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
move on to the next area until I make it

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.899 
move on to the next area until I make it
so<00:01:54.520> right<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:54.880> if<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.149> went<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.539> area<00:01:55.869> one<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
so right now if I went to area one that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.690 
so right now if I went to area one that
is<00:01:58.210> in<00:01:58.509> area<00:01:58.899> one<00:01:59.109> so<00:01:59.679> I<00:01:59.710> get<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.039> go<00:02:00.189> to<00:02:00.280> area

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
is in area one so I get to go to area

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.469 
is in area one so I get to go to area
two<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:03.159> an<00:02:03.429> area<00:02:03.609> two<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.179> get<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
two and that's an area two so I get to

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.809 
two and that's an area two so I get to
go<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.689> area<00:02:05.049> three

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
going to go to area for here area poor I

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.210 
going to go to area for here area poor I
got<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.560> Kerry

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
got it Kerry

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.380 
got it Kerry
five<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.750> is<00:02:16.930> not<00:02:17.110> normal<00:02:17.650> area<00:02:18.190> six<00:02:18.700> so

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
five this is not normal area six so

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.480 
five this is not normal area six so
perfect<00:02:20.230> game<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.740> time<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.310> not

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
perfect game at that time but that's not

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.850 
perfect game at that time but that's not
what<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> typically<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.590> do<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.710> know

maybe I do so that's what we're going to
try<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:25.990> a<00:02:26.320> normal<00:02:27.070> typical<00:02:27.310> score<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
try to do a normal typical score for a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360

wreck<00:02:29.020> player<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.500> junior<00:02:29.860> would<00:02:30.250> be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
wreck player or junior would be

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.660 
wreck player or junior would be
somewhere<00:02:30.610> between<00:02:31.170> ten<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.200> fifteen<00:02:32.920> if<00:02:33.430> you
