00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:14.690
 refers to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.759
 on an alternator whose function is 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 recharge the battery 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:26.910
 then we will show the god mount 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.429
 name of test pieces assembly and test 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 Last 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.750
 the alternator being shown by the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.440
 the rear of the engine 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.440
 tension 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:52.129
 the first part to be disassembled from the 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.059
 alternator is to remove the gem 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.059
 voltage regulator 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.129
 then the fan 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.129
 it is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.909
 or continuity and short the mass 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:19.149
 the next step using the bag rolling 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.539
 instructor withdraws from the 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.539
 bearing 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.550
 then the soldier's three prongs 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 extractor 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 we removed the same from the carcass 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.120
 sell with the only meaning 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:24.410
 now the structure inverts the diode 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.950
 you are good you can not light the lamp 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.330
 in this case of perfect diode gold 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.269
 stator being good 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.150
 then the voltage regulator is left 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.420
 is the regulator of or perceives the 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.849
 two risk the two reference points 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.849
 that were made in disassembly now 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 facilitates 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.120
 realizes that the alternates
