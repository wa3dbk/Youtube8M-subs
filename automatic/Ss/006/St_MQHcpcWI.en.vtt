00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 This is the samsom and note in HD 5000 series correct time went 3 different sizes 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.719
 namely in the 32 teams degree team has diagonal plan 81 centimeters and so see 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 here is that the fourth time I find that in the name of 100 m 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 two centimeters ns to a large extent namely 46 in the water 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.820
 with a diagonal meanwhile 17 percent 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.649
 We searched and fell from the one HD 5000 series A has a piano paint so hit the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.370
 edge 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.089
 with the round books and when you come adb bottom you see that one 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.460
 we were covered 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.659
 that is because you have sound so that it just briefly 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.649
 although to improve 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.350
 hey and he has a piano lacquer black the round 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.330
 the base and this television has rounded corners 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.840
 nac backwards I say this boy is hanging nicely on the wall and this is the distance 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.850
 those things that do not belong to the television he does not find it necessary 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.410
 brushed neat look 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
 clear earn 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 the specification one of these samson it is a talent 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.219
 television 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.219
 he is feeling he did and he has 50 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 the connections on the back of the television 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 he has 2 i had more connections 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.640
 scart it a lisbeth connection at the district office from the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.500
 side 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.890
 he finds component connection 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 it a composite connection 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.560
 and he has one in the col it is a bit of a pio cinema set on this can 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.109
 he is of course also the antenna karin connection and he knows 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.740
 headphone jack 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.640
 it also has an interface connection from the rear 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 both could go in the us you can share digital television cards with 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.860
 television and I can use vampire digital channels directly 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.430
 beets television has in dbb m 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.399
 bbc movies 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.119
 bbtk is that you then stand with your kpn digitenne card with cambuur there immediately 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.280
 can stabbing television 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 and it is no longer digital 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.580
 can watch dvb c TV I think a little digital card along with Cambuur 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.249
 the can directly put in the television because these television recordings 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.529
 joe tucci 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.079
 see well put a job certified in all these cases no longer means the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.990
 chin extra cachet more television 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.440
 there must therefore be everything with 2 write-downs but no all traffic write-downs 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.339
 Both teams play connection can transfer your photos and videos to music files 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.939
 directly on your television 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 to play 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.589
 if you have bought a nice flat television for years you should not be on the 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.409
 You can of course set foot but the best thing is also a nice one 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.869
 plate 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.269
 turn and birds view everything the solution 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.650
 from the small television from 19 in stop the large television to and 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.550
 with seventy is above everything else 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.720
 can do it to the board 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.149
 really flatter than this is not possible 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:18.239
 but 39 do you want to have the television shown, yes, the solution for that 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.269
 but you are in a room where you see the television picture from that angle 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.919
 look also help the solution we can take it completely off the wall we can take one 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.350
 place gets its ankle no we can now also normal to the left refueling 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.489
 but the store again 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.589
 It can still be a bit on the ground wherever that camp 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.479
 say it and have a good sense of humor against the wall 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:36.469
 it can do that too 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.599
 and again drive cables nice get rid all mini and twitter on black the cable 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.620
 gootjes in short does not fall out of tune for tv fm how you with his will on 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:50.249
 at the provopoulos there is always the solution for the 95 percent of the 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.870
 complaints received by us say to resolve by using the 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:58.609
 new rooms i have two types of cables one is for the signal 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.289
 get entrance is 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:02.229
 to connect equipment by now 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.069
 You can have the most expensive equipment the moment at the source is free there 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.919
 of course you have completely mixa 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.359
 we advise we here if someone is malicious, there is of course no reason for them 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.769
 namely that the cable corks labeouf and it namely in the 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.059
 direction of garda, good image and sound 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.139
 Yes we have of course all parts well on the way to help the 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.840
 socket the spurter 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.009
 the connectors 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.960
 and then of course the cables dozens of lengths and of course over the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.789
 signal amplifier and this cial amplifier is also a splitter through 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.949
 you can connect several televisions for example I had in the room 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.080
 prof the bedroom or maybe the kitchen 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.439
 and then of course extremely important are the three cables for the 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.620
 connecting the peripherals we use the cables one of the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.479
 four purchases simply because they are the best on televisions from 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.509
