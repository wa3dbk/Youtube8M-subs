00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.470

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.089

 of music on the lock screen 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.230
 your device but for it first you 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.880
 device must have a few 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.370
 requirements such as for example having 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.830
 root access and also have what is the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.480

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.990
 what is the export 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.270
 another file that is in both in 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.860
 apk format that we will then leave in 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.020
 the description of the video once you already 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.970
 we have transferred it to these two 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.519
 files and that your device complies with 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.350
 these requirements that we just 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.040
 mention above could our 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.860
 file manager 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.650
 to all the files and within the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.300
 file let's go to the card the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.400
 device a folder called to 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.860
 more games that I have created and this 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 these are the two files that 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.610
 we need as you can see here this the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 player what is believed and this is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.870
 the exposed file that I mentioned 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.660
 previously and we are simply going to 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.820
 proceed to install the two watching the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.790
 installation assistant as any 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.740
 application put exo we are not going to open and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.570
 then we will install the other file 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.490
 that I exposed as you can see here the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.060
 installer we installed it and it's already 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 already installed we can leave at all a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 Once done everything as you can see here 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
 there are the two applications but you have to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.850
 for changes to be made, you have to 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.130
 restart your operating system 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 device so that the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.130
 changes and you can see what is the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.550
 music player on the screen 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.410
 lock let's restart the device 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.510
 we reset them 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.570
 start the device we're going to have to 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.690
 activate what is the exposed model 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.640
 here it says that it is not yet activated as 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.030
 can see here you have to activate this 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.010
 option for the process to be done 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.900
 we have already activated a 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.610
 It has once already activated yet as already 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.940
 simple to see the result we're going to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.880
 run our player I already have 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 this one that comes pre-installed in my 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.170
 device and we're going to turn off the screen 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.270
 to see the result on the screen 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.690
 blockade and as you can appreciate here already 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 we have the music player in 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.220
 our lock screen if 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.040
 need to enter to unlock the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.740
