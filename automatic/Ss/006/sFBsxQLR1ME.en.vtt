00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.900
 and more information that keeps coming 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.120
 to dropper of playstation 4 and is that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.420
 it seems that they are and has not presented 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.700
 all right your console or at least what 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 has done in a somewhat ambiguous way 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.680
 because I say this because after that 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 presentation continue to appear 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 answers to questions that we all 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.090
 we did and confirmed answers by 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 example is the case of that dual shock 4 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 that on this occasion it has been confirmed that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.350
 it will not be compatible with the old 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 classic controls of playstation is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.030
 say for example the dual shock 3 we go 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 to give you an idea that already 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.469
 you can keep those dual shock 3 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.690
 for your playstation3 because in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 playstation 4 you will not be able to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 use the new which soc 4 is going to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.100
 Include new functions and buttons 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.710
 totally necessary to navigate through 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.870
 the playstation menu itself 4 by 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 example a good example of this is the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.150
 option button a button that replaces 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.710
 start and select and the share button that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 allows to publish videos and images 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 during our games in addition the idea 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.100
 what do you have with player 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.830
 4 is that most games 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.900
 use that new touch screen that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.910
 have included in the command something logical for 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.130
 another side because otherwise they're going to 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.750
 include a touch screen if you do not 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.810
 let's use and of course 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.840
 evidently the dualshock 3 does not consist 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.940
 of that touch screen but there are some 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.140
 that another good news is that the play 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.030
 station move 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 yes they will be compatible with playstation 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.580
 4 and also the new major camera 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.950
 definition can also be used with 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.750
 those playstation move that we already have in 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.150
 our homes well this actually 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 it was already demonstrated in that playstation event 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.800
 meeting and we continue with more news of 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.020
 playstation 4 this time with the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.479
 definition you remember when you 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.820
 talked about that playstation 4 could 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.640
 support the definition of the future 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.700
 the definition 4k because if they are and has 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.980
 confirmed that he will support that 4k of 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.320
 resolution the playstation 4 what 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.630
 they come to be 3 thousand 840 x 2160 pixels 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.340
 we go a lot but only what 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.129
 will stand in the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.319
 in the games we will not be able to use 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.050
 said resolution something that on the other hand 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.780
 also indicates that the console would not be 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.790
 as powerful as some expected all 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.519
 this information has been confirmed by 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.959
 shuhei yoshida the president of sony 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.959
 computer entertainment 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.800
