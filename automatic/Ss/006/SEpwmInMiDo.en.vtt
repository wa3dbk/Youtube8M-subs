00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.799
 Carl ticket we have a problem 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.739
 Biathlon made mobile stations 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.900
 clone recognition handlers 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.109
 who can accommodate and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.769
 I am young to calculate 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.369
 this can not be allowed 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.039
 what to do 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.080
 to fly 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.449
 you love 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.069
 what sense 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.060
 go 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.060
 I'll show you something 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
 GDP 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.980
 in USA 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.130
 in Russia 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.040
 because of the crisis 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.640
 for age 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 if the site of the publication 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.700
 The meeting will be a press event 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.870
 t 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.740
 with 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.060
 here it is a flying wing 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.170
 experimental sample 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 the marked thought to resume guns 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940
 those wallow and blades 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.670
 but I think I can manage 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.120
 I'll go car 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.630
 whether on tv channel over 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 instances 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.709
 there is a first unstable signal so 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 tropical 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.739

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:12.579
 her 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.559
 another next 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.559
 there is such a very weak signal 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.799
 3 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.549
 Yes 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.599
 fine

 her 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.069
 another next 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.449
 one more but how many are there 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.469
 rubles 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.389

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.139
 n 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.969
 or 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.939
 double next 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.189
 here is the fifth signal unstable 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.199
 everything

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.159
