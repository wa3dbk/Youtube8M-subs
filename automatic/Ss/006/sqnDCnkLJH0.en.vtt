00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.049
 in this lesson we will talk 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.509
 of the general organization of 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:13.390
 matter devoting more attention 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:16.180
 to the solutions all the matter can 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.560
 be divided into pure amy substances 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.860
 rocks 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.199
 the first are those constituted substances 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.710
 or to a single type of molecule or 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:29.500
 even from just one type of element 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.920
 they are therefore divided into elements and in 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 the elements are compounds 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.430
 substances consisting of a single type of 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.270
 atom that is in single form or in 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.630
 molecular form as the two compounds 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.000
 instead they are those constituted substances 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.280
 from one type of molecule this 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.829
 molecule however can be formed from 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.290
 different atoms as long as these yes 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.840
 aggregate to always form the same 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.200
 for example, a molecule would not be one 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.440
 pure substance if we had a substance 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.900
 formed from oxygen and hydrogen though that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.040
 sometimes it combines to form water and ea 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:17.020
 times the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 substances 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.810
 they also cannot be broken down 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.590
 through physical passages in essence it is 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.299
 simpler in simpler components 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.549
 to decompose them 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.950
 you need to use one 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:38.650
 chemical transformation such as 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:41.439
 electrolysis mixtures instead are 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.939
 the mixture of two or more substances 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.640
 also in this case separate the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.240
 different substances that compose it e 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.799
 in fact, they are simpler 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.350
 physical transformations such as 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.939
 evaporation but it may be sufficient 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.439
 also the centrifugation or the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:07.079
 filtration the mixtures are divided into 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:10.899
 heterogeneous and homogeneous in heterogeneity 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.750
 Many substances separate from each other and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.590
 they are distinguishable in different phases 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.600
 in the homogeneous ones instead the single ones 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.890
 molecules of the substances they compose 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.540
 the mixture is mixed together in 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.540
 such a way that the naked eye is not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.000
 possible to distinguish a substance 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.000
 on the other hand, it is the uniform aspect 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.709
 homogeneous mixtures are also called 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.950
 solutions and can be given by 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.890
 combination of components in all 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.410
 solid solid aggregation states 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.410
 liquid or gaseous liquid gas 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 in these cases the different components 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.680
 that for simplicity we will consider them 2 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.560
 the one in will be named solvent 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.560
 absolute major component that in 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.030
 dissolute minor component and what 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.030
 dissolves in the solvent 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.080
 It is possible however also to find solutions 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.950
 combining different aggregation states 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.470
 in this case we will call solvent 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.100
 the one that preserves once formed the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 solution to his state of aggregation 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.750
 absolute the one who loses his 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.660
 aggregation study for example water 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.970
 and salt the solvent will be water on 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.130
 I greet the salt because once formed 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.560
 the solution the solution will remain 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.140
 liquid like the water it represents 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.320
 then the solvent 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.230
 usually when between the two elements of 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.299
 a solution there is one thick liquid 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.299
 the solvent and the liquid one 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.290
 let's see some examples of 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.049
 liquid liquid solution solutions the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.540
 solvent and the one that will make up the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:15.799
 solution in greater quantities solutions 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.130
 solid liquid 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:23.280
 the final solution preserves the status of 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.780
 liquid in this case will be water a 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.710
 represent the solvent solutions 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.710
 gaseous liquid 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.740
 the final solution will always remain 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.780
 liquid for this the solvent will be 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.180
 always water with the liquid component 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.840
 choice in this case the beer that 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.840
 we made it sparkling 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.990
 then there are as we have said le 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.150
 solid solid solutions in this case 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.780
 the solvent is in the quantity 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.350
 greater a specific category of 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.930
 Solid solid solutions are the alloys 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.080
 ie those solid solid solutions of 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.860
 which at least one component is represented 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.860
 from a metal 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.400
 then we have the gaseous solutions that 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.400
 many tend to classify as a 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.320
 separate group of homogeneous mixtures but 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.610
 that for simplicity we will treat how 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.880
 solutions a classic example and air a 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.510
 we seem homogeneous all transparent 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.270
 odorless yet it is composed of different gases 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.140
 of which the main components are 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.140
 nitrogen and oxygen
