this framework which it'll install

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.639 
this framework which it'll install
automatically<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> read<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.109> full

and<00:01:04.549> once<00:01:05.549> you've<00:01:05.760> installed<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.570> admin

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
and once you've installed it admin

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.940 
and once you've installed it admin
rights<00:01:07.560> obviously<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:09.150> looks<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.030 

sync<00:01:13.950> toy<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> basically<00:01:16.500> allows<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
sync toy so basically allows you to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.789 
sync toy so basically allows you to
create<00:01:17.430> pairs<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.259> create<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> new

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
create pairs so you can create a new

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.719 
create pairs so you can create a new
pair<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.700> I've<00:01:21.330> created<00:01:21.720> several<00:01:22.580> okay

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
pair from here I've created several okay

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.780 
pair from here I've created several okay
and<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.360> look<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.790> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
and you can look at all of them and you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.810 
and you can look at all of them and you
can<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.180> say<00:01:27.630> write<00:01:28.110> choose<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> left

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
can then say write choose on the left

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
can then say write choose on the left

you can have it on a cloud station you
can<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.829> Dropbox<00:01:46.850> as<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:48.090> got<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
can have it on Dropbox as I've got it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.830 
can have it on Dropbox as I've got it
here

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
here

and<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> choose<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.329> action<00:01:51.329> which<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
and you can choose the action which is

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.950 
and you can choose the action which is
synchronization<00:01:53.659> echo<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.960> contribute

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
synchronization echo and contribute

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
synchronization echo and contribute
synchronization<00:01:58.130> short<00:01:59.130> explanation<00:01:59.430> says

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
synchronization short explanation says

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.090 
synchronization short explanation says
new<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> updated<00:02:00.899> files<00:02:01.439> are<00:02:01.590> copied<00:02:01.740> both

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
new and updated files are copied both

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.060 
new and updated files are copied both
ways<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.750> both<00:02:03.990> ways<00:02:04.229> rename<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
ways so it's both ways rename it and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.089 
ways so it's both ways rename it and
deletes<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.670> either<00:02:05.909> side<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:07.229> repeated<00:02:07.890> on

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
deletes on either side are repeated on

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.999 
deletes on either side are repeated on
the<00:02:08.190> other

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
the other

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.309 
the other
eko<00:02:12.069> does<00:02:13.069> new<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.030> updated<00:02:14.329> files<00:02:15.019> are

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
eko does new and updated files are

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.759 
eko does new and updated files are
copied<00:02:15.530> left<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.970> it's<00:02:17.090> one<00:02:17.269> way<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
copied left to right so it's one way and

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.110 
copied left to right so it's one way and
renames<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.040> deletes<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.640> left<00:02:19.909> are

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
renames and deletes on the left are

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.270 
renames and deletes on the left are
repeated<00:02:20.629> on<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.870> right<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.500> would<00:02:21.799> test<00:02:22.069> it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
repeated on the right so I would test it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.780 
repeated on the right so I would test it
out<00:02:22.370> before<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:23.709> once<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.010> get<00:02:25.220> fully

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
out before you once you can get fully

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.330 
out before you once you can get fully
grips<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.569> then<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.870> can<00:02:27.200> choose<00:02:28.040> which

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
grips with it then you can choose which

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.509 
grips with it then you can choose which
one<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.670> want<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.440> contribute<00:02:30.440> allows<00:02:31.250> you

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
one you want to do contribute allows you
