level<00:01:23.890> we<00:01:24.040> have<00:01:24.250> some<00:01:25.030> distinct<00:01:25.420> locations<00:01:25.960> we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
level we have some distinct locations we

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.749 
level we have some distinct locations we
have<00:01:26.140> here<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.710> elevator<00:01:27.250> building<00:01:27.670> or

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759

elevator shafts we have here the

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.810 
elevator shafts we have here the
electrical<00:01:31.600> area<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.799> then<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.399> have<00:01:33.579> right

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
electrical area and then we have right

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.410 
electrical area and then we have right
here<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.329> helipad<00:01:35.759> beneath<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.880> helipad<00:01:37.149> is

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
here the helipad beneath the helipad is

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.359 
here the helipad beneath the helipad is
also<00:01:37.750> an<00:01:37.840> entrance<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.560> takes<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.860> down<00:01:39.070> to

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
also an entrance that takes you down to

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.819 
also an entrance that takes you down to
the<00:01:39.670> passageway<00:01:40.210> which<00:01:41.020> basically<00:01:41.350> gives<00:01:41.680> you

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
the passageway which basically gives you

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.730 
the passageway which basically gives you
at<00:01:42.009> least<00:01:42.040> three<00:01:42.640> different<00:01:43.299> main<00:01:43.740> entrances

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
at least three different main entrances

at least three different main entrances
and<00:01:44.890> exits<00:01:45.009> from<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.329> passageway<00:01:47.640> over<00:01:48.640> here

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
and exits from the passageway over here

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.149 
and exits from the passageway over here
we<00:01:48.880> also<00:01:48.909> have<00:01:49.180> some<00:01:49.450> scaffolding<00:01:49.979> unless<00:01:50.979> you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
we also have some scaffolding unless you

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.580 
we also have some scaffolding unless you
want<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> die<00:01:51.549> stay<00:01:52.149> away<00:01:52.299> from<00:01:52.360> those<00:01:52.600> okay

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
want to die stay away from those okay

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.010 
want to die stay away from those okay
there's<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.250> nothing<00:01:54.579> to<00:01:54.610> do<00:01:54.790> there<00:01:55.060> there

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
there's really nothing to do there there

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.899 
there's really nothing to do there there
is<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> neat<00:01:56.350> little<00:01:56.439> trick<00:01:56.710> involving<00:01:57.640> this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
is a neat little trick involving this

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.760 
is a neat little trick involving this
little<00:01:58.210> corner<00:01:58.509> here<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:59.020> get<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.290> up<00:01:59.439> on<00:01:59.590> this

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
little corner here to get you up on this

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.529 
little corner here to get you up on this
building<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.369> takes<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.729> up<00:02:00.759> on<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.119> top<00:02:01.329> of

the building what you may or may not

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.240 
the building what you may or may not
know<00:02:03.039> already<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.759> will<00:02:03.909> save<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.659> for<00:02:04.990> mast

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
know already I will save that for mast

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.569 
know already I will save that for mast
all<00:02:06.250> right

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
all right

actually two ways you can do it one is
from<00:05:51.910> this<00:05:52.150> elevator<00:05:52.690> shaft<00:05:52.780> directly<00:05:53.590> or<00:05:54.370> the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
from this elevator shaft directly or the

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.220 
from this elevator shaft directly or the
other<00:05:55.000> is<00:05:55.180> from<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.390> helipad<00:05:55.720> what<00:05:56.080> you're

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230

other is from the helipad what you're
going<00:05:56.350> to<00:05:56.410> end<00:05:56.500> up<00:05:56.590> doing<00:05:56.890> is<00:05:57.010> walking<00:05:57.160> up

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
going to end up doing is walking up

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.150 
going to end up doing is walking up
these<00:05:57.580> stairs<00:05:58.530> running<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.680> jumping<00:05:59.980> onto

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
these stairs running and jumping onto

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.460 
these stairs running and jumping onto
this<00:06:00.370> platform<00:06:00.780> which<00:06:01.780> will<00:06:01.960> then<00:06:02.080> jump<00:06:02.290> onto

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
this platform which will then jump onto

this platform which will then jump onto
the<00:06:02.650> platform<00:06:03.070> there<00:06:03.370> which<00:06:03.790> they<00:06:04.000> should

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
the platform there which they should

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.850 
the platform there which they should
enter<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.660> elevator<00:06:04.990> shaft<00:06:05.320> and<00:06:05.560> then<00:06:05.650> from

enter the elevator shaft and then from

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.650 
enter the elevator shaft and then from
there<00:06:06.040> it's<00:06:06.190> the<00:06:06.280> same<00:06:06.490> way<00:06:06.670> as<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.510> other

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
there it's the same way as the other
