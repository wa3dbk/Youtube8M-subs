00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
whammy pedal is a great example when

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.530 
whammy pedal is a great example when
Steve<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.190> picked<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.730> whammy<00:04:11.910> pedal<00:04:12.060> just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
Steve I picked up the whammy pedal just

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540 
Steve I picked up the whammy pedal just
thought<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.320> really<00:04:13.709> great<00:04:13.860> there

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
thought this is just really great there

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.490 
thought this is just really great there
was<00:04:14.730> nobody<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.540> planet<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.109> did<00:04:16.350> that

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
was nobody in the planet that did that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.570 
was nobody in the planet that did that
and<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:17.940> they're<00:04:18.120> really<00:04:18.450> innovators<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.580> I'm

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
and so they're really innovators and I'm

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.949 
and so they're really innovators and I'm
really<00:04:20.880> excited<00:04:21.000> about<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.690> particular

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
really excited about this particular
