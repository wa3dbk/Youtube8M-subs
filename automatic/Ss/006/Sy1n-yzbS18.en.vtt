naturally my eyebrows are very dark and

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.760 
naturally my eyebrows are very dark and
very<00:00:20.700> thick<00:00:21.149> on<00:00:21.329> their<00:00:21.599> own<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.110> I<00:00:22.140> don't<00:00:22.410> need

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
very thick on their own so I don't need

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.830 
very thick on their own so I don't need
a<00:00:22.800> ton<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.520> powder<00:00:23.849> to<00:00:24.090> fill<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.450> in<00:00:24.599> I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a ton for a powder to fill them in I

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
a ton for a powder to fill them in I
just<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.710> use<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.309> define<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.360> more

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
just like to use it to define them more

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.179 
just like to use it to define them more
and<00:00:27.689> make<00:00:27.960> them<00:00:28.140> look<00:00:28.320> more<00:00:29.040> put<00:00:29.309> together<00:00:29.720> I

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
and make them look more put together I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.780 
and make them look more put together I
do

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
do

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.690 
do
wax<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.300> eyebrows<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.989> pluck<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
wax my eyebrows and pluck them but for

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.970 
wax my eyebrows and pluck them but for
the<00:00:35.760> most<00:00:35.970> part<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.410> let<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.800> do

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the most part I just like to let them do

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190 
the most part I just like to let them do
their<00:00:38.130> own<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.750> don't<00:00:39.810> mess<00:00:40.170> with

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
their own thing and I don't mess with

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.740 
their own thing and I don't mess with
the<00:00:40.680> natural<00:00:41.190> shape<00:00:41.400> or<00:00:41.910> anything<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the natural shape or anything like that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.230 
the natural shape or anything like that
I<00:00:43.760> just<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.420> lot<00:00:45.630> less<00:00:46.020> hassle<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
I just think it's a lot less hassle to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.490 
I just think it's a lot less hassle to
leave<00:00:48.240> them<00:00:48.450> alone<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> let<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.350> their

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
leave them alone and let them do their

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040 
leave them alone and let them do their
own<00:00:49.530> thing<00:00:49.920> than<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.000> mess<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.870> them

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
own thing than it is to mess with them

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.260 
own thing than it is to mess with them
and<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.440> completely<00:00:53.220> change<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.910> shape<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
and just completely change the shape of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.930 
and just completely change the shape of
your<00:00:54.329> eyebrows<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.110> prefer<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.280> film<00:00:56.700> my

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
your eyebrows I prefer to film my

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.780 
your eyebrows I prefer to film my
eyebrows<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:58.140> powder<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:59.010> don't<00:00:59.520> like

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
eyebrows in with a powder and don't like

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.729 
eyebrows in with a powder and don't like
using<00:01:00.180> pencils<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> never<00:01:01.200> get<00:01:01.500> them<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
using pencils I can never get them to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.189 
using pencils I can never get them to
look<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.360> is<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.690> powder<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
Couture these three darker shadows are

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
Couture these three darker shadows are
actually<00:01:09.810> by<00:01:09.960> Mac<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> did<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.070> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
actually by Mac and what I did was just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.980 
actually by Mac and what I did was just
took<00:01:11.490> out<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> Lancome<00:01:12.210> shadows<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.900> then

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
took out the Lancome shadows and then

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.920 
took out the Lancome shadows and then
put<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.950> Mac<00:01:14.310> shadow<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.270> its<00:01:15.420> place<00:01:15.690> I'm

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
put the Mac shadow in its place I'm

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
put the Mac shadow in its place I'm
sorry<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.710> remember<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.490> shadow<00:01:17.760> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
sorry I don't remember what shadow it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
sorry I don't remember what shadow it
was<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.330> think<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.750> espresso<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.680> could<00:01:20.250> be

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
was I think it was espresso I could be

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
was I think it was espresso I could be
wrong<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.900> choose<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.290> shadow<00:01:22.560> that's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
wrong but just choose a shadow that's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149 
wrong but just choose a shadow that's
close<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:24.210> hair<00:01:24.630> color<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.350> you'll

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
close to your hair color and then you'll

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:26.810 
close to your hair color and then you'll
be<00:01:26.310> fine

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
be fine

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.469 
be fine
I<00:01:27.200> use<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.500> small<00:01:28.700> angled<00:01:29.700> brush<00:01:29.760> this<00:01:30.299> one's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I use a small angled brush this one's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.219 
I use a small angled brush this one's
from<00:01:30.659> ELF

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
from ELF

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
from ELF
I<00:01:31.260> think<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> smaller<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.610> brush<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.270> more

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
I think the smaller the brush the more

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.780 
I think the smaller the brush the more
control<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:33.990> over<00:01:34.680> filling<00:01:35.580> in<00:01:35.670> your

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
control you have over filling in your

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.780 
control you have over filling in your
brows<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.330> used<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.320> bigger<00:01:38.280> angled

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
brows I used to use a bigger angled

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.980 
brows I used to use a bigger angled
brush<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:41.010> works<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.210> definitely

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
brush and it works well but I definitely

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
brush and it works well but I definitely
prefer<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> smaller<00:01:43.799> brush<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.430> more

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
prefer the smaller brush to get more

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.539 
prefer the smaller brush to get more
control<00:01:44.940> you<00:01:45.330> can<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.040> define

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
control you can you know really define

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.410 
control you can you know really define
things<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:50.580> think<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> smaller

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
things and I just think that the smaller

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
things and I just think that the smaller
brush<00:01:51.720> works<00:01:52.170> better<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.760> definition<00:01:53.760> and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
brush works better for definition and

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.280 
brush works better for definition and
everything<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.110> also

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
everything like that and you can also

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
everything like that and you can also
really<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:56.250> eyebrows<00:01:56.549> are<00:01:56.729> really<00:01:56.939> angled

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
really your eyebrows are really angled

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.710 
really your eyebrows are really angled
it's<00:01:57.869> easier<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.790> keep<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.479> lines

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
it's easier to you know keep the lines

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
start looking really gross but I just

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.740 
start looking really gross but I just
recently<00:03:29.070> gotten<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.549> new<00:03:29.700> one<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.299> other<00:03:30.450> day

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
recently gotten a new one the other day

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.020 
recently gotten a new one the other day
and<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.110> figured<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.560> while<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> clean

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
and I figured that while I have a clean

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.470 
and I figured that while I have a clean
one<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.660> looks<00:03:33.989> good<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.190> should<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.209> brow

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
one that looks good I should do the brow

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.120 
one that looks good I should do the brow
tutorial<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> looks<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.980> little

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
tutorial just so that it looks a little

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
tutorial just so that it looks a little
bit<00:03:38.340> nicer<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.760> camera<00:03:39.299> instead<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.690> pulling

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
bit nicer on camera instead of pulling

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.220 
bit nicer on camera instead of pulling
out<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.680> brown<00:03:41.400> dirty-looking<00:03:42.329> clear<00:03:42.840> mascara

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
out a brown dirty-looking clear mascara

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.340 
out a brown dirty-looking clear mascara
it's<00:03:43.860> not<00:03:44.100> dirty<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it's not dirty it's just you know the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.289 
it's not dirty it's just you know the
brow<00:03:46.530> powder<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:47.790> not<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.970> big<00:03:48.120> deal

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
brow powder in it so it's not a big deal

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.270 
brow powder in it so it's not a big deal
but<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:49.260> for<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> sake<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.920> video<00:03:50.220> I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
but just for the sake of this video I

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.699 
but just for the sake of this video I
figured<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.820> should<00:03:50.850> use<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.720> clean<00:03:51.989> brand<00:03:52.560> new

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
figured I should use a clean brand new

just<00:04:11.830> really<00:04:11.980> dark<00:04:12.690> what<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.050> do<00:04:14.170> is

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
just really dark what I like to do is

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.360 
just really dark what I like to do is
just<00:04:15.810> define<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.140> angles<00:04:17.680> of<00:04:17.769> my<00:04:17.920> eyebrows

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
just define the angles of my eyebrows

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.479 
just define the angles of my eyebrows
and<00:04:18.730> make<00:04:19.209> them<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.390> little<00:04:19.540> bit<00:04:19.780> darker

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and make them a little bit darker

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.980

everybody<00:04:21.489> always<00:04:21.790> tells<00:04:22.090> me<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.600> don't

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
everybody always tells me that I don't

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.810 
everybody always tells me that I don't
need<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.230> fill<00:04:23.410> in<00:04:23.500> my<00:04:23.620> eyebrows<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.520> just

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
need to fill in my eyebrows but I just

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.610 
need to fill in my eyebrows but I just
think<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.540> it<00:04:25.690> looks<00:04:25.870> more<00:04:26.170> put-together

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
think that it looks more put-together

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.890 
think that it looks more put-together
and<00:04:27.540> I<00:04:28.680> really<00:04:29.680> like<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.040> way<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:31.210> looks<00:04:31.450> when

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
and I really like the way it looks when

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.630 
and I really like the way it looks when
my<00:04:32.530> eyebrows<00:04:33.160> are<00:04:33.610> stronger<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.530> what<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.920> do<00:04:36.040> is

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
my eyebrows are stronger so what I do is

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.230 
my eyebrows are stronger so what I do is
just<00:04:36.700> take<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.750> darker<00:04:38.170> color<00:04:38.200> on<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.240> angle

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
just take this darker color on the angle

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:50.340 
just take this darker color on the angle
brush<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:47.200> just<00:04:47.440> define<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.870> lower<00:04:49.870> part

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
brush and I just define the lower part

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.640 
brush and I just define the lower part
of<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:52.260> back<00:04:53.260> of<00:04:53.560> my<00:04:53.770> eyebrow<00:04:54.390> so<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.420> just<00:04:55.720> go

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
of the back of my eyebrow so I just go

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.100 
of the back of my eyebrow so I just go
lightly<00:04:56.980> underneath<00:04:57.610> just<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.600> make<00:04:58.780> this

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
lightly underneath just to make this

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.150 
lightly underneath just to make this
part<00:04:59.500> stronger<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:01.380> then<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.410> do<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.980> back

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
part stronger and then I do the back

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.659 
part stronger and then I do the back
part

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.929 

and<00:05:11.969> then<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.840> will<00:05:13.050> lightly<00:05:13.590> do<00:05:13.979> top<00:05:16.789> and<00:05:17.789> I'm

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:18.890 
and then I will lightly do top and I'm
not<00:05:18.150> really
