00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.140 
you're going to throw the braid in here
down<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.959> end<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.160> gets<00:02:58.700> stuck<00:02:58.970> on

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
down to the end and this gets stuck on

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.759 
down to the end and this gets stuck on
hearing<00:03:04.239> roll<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.420> down<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.019> end<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.530> then

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
hearing roll it down to the end and then

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.820 
hearing roll it down to the end and then
you're<00:03:06.890> just<00:03:07.070> going<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.459> wrap<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.700> around<00:03:10.300> and

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
you're just going to wrap it around and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.890 
you're just going to wrap it around and
pin<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.450> when<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:16.370> get<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:17.000> where<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.630> want<00:03:17.840> it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900

to<00:03:18.140> be

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.490 

so<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.460> can<00:03:27.640> just<00:03:27.850> tuck<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.360> under<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.230> other

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
so you can just tuck it under the other

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
so you can just tuck it under the other
here<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:31.090> pin<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.600> place

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540
