00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.420 
now addressing us and has to be
addressed<00:06:47.980> and<00:06:48.310> in<00:06:48.850> one<00:06:49.120> stroke<00:06:49.510> that<00:06:50.430> that

addressed and in one stroke that that

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.020 
addressed and in one stroke that that
window<00:06:51.880> does<00:06:52.120> it<00:06:52.890> because<00:06:53.890> there<00:06:54.400> is<00:06:54.790> the

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
window does it because there is the

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.830

ocean sky everything and that I think is

ocean sky everything and that I think is
the<00:07:03.940> tremendous<00:07:04.240> achievement<00:07:05.050> of<00:07:05.260> that

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
the tremendous achievement of that

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.640 
the tremendous achievement of that
