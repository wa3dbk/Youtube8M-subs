00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
this one we want to hold for just a two

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:52.540 
this one we want to hold for just a two
to<00:04:41.630> three<00:04:41.870> seconds<00:04:42.290> as<00:04:42.440> well<00:04:46.000> these

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.119 

again<00:04:53.240> five<00:04:53.569> reps<00:04:53.840> of<00:04:54.050> those<00:04:54.199> two<00:04:54.650> sets<00:04:54.949> on

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
again five reps of those two sets on

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.140 
again five reps of those two sets on
these<00:04:55.250> sides<00:04:55.550> with<00:04:55.789> ten<00:04:56.030> reps<00:04:56.300> total<00:04:57.940> our<00:04:58.940> last

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
these sides with ten reps total our last

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.749 
these sides with ten reps total our last
one<00:05:01.180> working<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.449> internal<00:05:03.169> hip<00:05:03.319> rotation<00:05:03.919> so

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
one working on internal hip rotation so

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.270 
one working on internal hip rotation so
it's<00:05:04.909> called<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.180> line<00:05:05.389> needs<00:05:05.720> knees<00:05:05.990> stretch

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.860 

we're<00:05:10.280> going<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.430> be<00:05:10.580> planted<00:05:11.060> outside<00:05:11.750> the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
we're going to be planted outside the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.119 
we're going to be planted outside the
hip<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.289> shoulder<00:05:12.620> width<00:05:12.830> apart<00:05:15.009> then<00:05:16.009> we're

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:16.129 
hip and shoulder width apart then we're

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.290 
hip and shoulder width apart then we're
going<00:05:16.280> to<00:05:16.310> allow<00:05:16.400> our<00:05:16.699> knees<00:05:16.909> to<00:05:17.090> come

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
going to allow our knees to come

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.180 
going to allow our knees to come
together<00:05:17.449> in<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.900> middle<00:05:18.169> we<00:05:18.710> don't<00:05:18.979> want

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
together in the middle we don't want

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:45.480 
together in the middle we don't want
them<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.400> touch<00:05:19.580> one<00:05:23.349> two

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.159 

okay<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:46.090> now<00:05:46.330> when<00:05:46.509> we're<00:05:46.660> just<00:05:46.750> holding<00:05:46.960> a

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
okay so now when we're just holding a

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.480 
okay so now when we're just holding a
couple<00:05:47.470> seconds<00:05:47.860> we're<00:05:48.009> not<00:05:48.130> putting<00:05:48.310> any

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
couple seconds we're not putting any

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.159 
couple seconds we're not putting any
pressure<00:05:48.580> on<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.300> wants<00:05:49.509> to<00:05:49.600> go<00:05:49.720> through<00:05:49.870> five

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
pressure on so wants to go through five

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.650 
pressure on so wants to go through five
I'm<00:05:50.680> going<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.949> do<00:05:51.039> five<00:05:51.310> more<00:05:51.699> where<00:05:52.360> we<00:05:52.449> put<00:05:52.630> a

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
I'm going to do five more where we put a

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.300 
I'm going to do five more where we put a
little<00:05:52.720> bit<00:05:53.020> of<00:05:53.110> pressure<00:05:53.289> of<00:05:53.560> their<00:05:53.650> hands<00:05:54.099> on

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
little bit of pressure of their hands on

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.800 
little bit of pressure of their hands on
the<00:05:54.400> outside<00:05:54.759> where<00:05:54.970> they<00:05:55.120> are<00:05:55.419> on<00:05:55.630> their

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
the outside where they are on their

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.180 
the outside where they are on their
knees<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:56.199> we're<00:05:56.289> going<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.470> get<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.860> little

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
knees so we're going to get a little

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.430 
knees so we're going to get a little
more<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.550> an<00:05:57.639> internal<00:05:57.970> rotation<00:05:58.479> it's<00:05:59.169> really

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
more of an internal rotation it's really

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.320 
more of an internal rotation it's really
