here we go just loading up fruit ninja
now<00:02:43.500> I'll<00:02:44.430> spin<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> phone<00:02:45.150> around<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
now I'll spin the phone around so you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.040 
now I'll spin the phone around so you
get<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.660> better<00:02:45.780> view<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:48.650> don't<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.800> fun

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
get a better view and I don't like fun

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.540 
get a better view and I don't like fun
obviously<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.230> use<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.769> fingers<00:02:53.370> as

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
obviously you can use your fingers as

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.580 
obviously you can use your fingers as
well<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.540> got<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> mouse<00:02:54.870> hooked<00:02:55.410> up

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
well so if you got the mouse hooked up

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.780 
well so if you got the mouse hooked up
you<00:02:55.769> can<00:02:55.920> still<00:02:56.100> use<00:02:56.130> your<00:02:56.459> fingers<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you can still use your fingers to

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.870 
you can still use your fingers to
control<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> phone<00:02:57.440> now<00:02:58.440> playing<00:02:58.769> games<00:02:59.040> with

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
control the phone now playing games with

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.490 
control the phone now playing games with
the<00:03:00.060> mouse<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.269> quite<00:03:01.170> an<00:03:01.260> interesting

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the mouse is quite an interesting

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.490 
the mouse is quite an interesting
experience<00:03:02.100> it's<00:03:02.810> say<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.019> easier<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.380> be

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
experience it's say it's easier to be

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.220 
experience it's say it's easier to be
more<00:03:04.680> precise<00:03:05.070> with<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.489> movements<00:03:06.239> but

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
more precise with your movements but

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500 
more precise with your movements but
it's<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.100> really<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.400> far<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.880> using<00:03:09.299> your

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it's not really as far as using your

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.720 
it's not really as far as using your
fingers<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.799> obviously<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> have<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.549> game

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
fingers so and obviously you have a game

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.220 
fingers so and obviously you have a game
like<00:03:11.850> GTA<00:03:12.269> where<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.810> know<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.959> want<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.140> be

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
like GTA where you know you want to be

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.460 
like GTA where you know you want to be
in<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.380> car<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:14.459> want<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.670> be<00:03:14.730> pressing<00:03:15.410> on<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
buttons to be driving it and steering at

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.360 
buttons to be driving it and steering at
the<00:03:18.660> same<00:03:18.840> time<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.380> can't<00:03:19.799> really<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.340> that

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the same time you can't really do that

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.360 
the same time you can't really do that
with<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> mouse<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.709> better<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.799> stay<00:03:23.100> away<00:03:23.310> from
