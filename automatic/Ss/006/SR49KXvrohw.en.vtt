 We have a handle on the rail 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.760
 It now made of plastic battery compartment 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
 including micro sd slot 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.620
 something is still in the box 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:09.050

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.690
 Let's go back to a first 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690
 look at the menu 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.330
 so I'm just after the re 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.700
 start I am right in the new 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:59.140
 profile voters choose to hike 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:04.900
 cycling tours cycling mountain biking 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.420
 hunt fishing mountaineering and geocaching 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.180
 as before , the profiles themselves 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 be adapted to be deleted new 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 to be added 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.150
 everything works over the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.770
 settings as gps cyclist 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.590
 Of course , I am interested in 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.140
 Most for salad driving profile with one 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 Tip, I'm right there in the profile 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.900
 in and find myself on the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 garden side by horizontal between 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.490
 it goes on to the compass page to 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.739
 dashboard and increase information 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.570
 all these bases are natural 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.320
 personally about the settings 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:54.019
 customizable drawer extend home 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.650
 button leads back to the profile 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.360
 voter the main menu is reached now 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.519
 by double clicking on the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.180
 Side buttons can be found here 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:13.489
 applications settings and additions 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.940
 Author devices known back and again 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.330
 the profile of the new central element of 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.959
 because it should have been the first time 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.350
 with the new menu logic from garmin 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.310
 itraxx touch and now I'll take a look 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.310
 take a look at the map 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:39.019
 from the profile voter is directly with 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.750
 a click in the map above with 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.580
 the button I solve the map and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.410
 can move freely now 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.800
 zoom in and that around 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.370
 a capacitive multitouch display 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.660
 The known ones also work 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 two finger gestures or double tap for 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.360
 Lonely so at first glance must 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.760
 I say 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.760
 speed is very acceptable 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.900
 move zoom is done neatly 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:26.160
 liquid important difference to 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 previous leisure card of the ladies team 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.910
 Models is that the active topo card 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.950
 now also routing able I try 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:43.010
 it takes a moment to get out of the way of moving my map 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:51.600
 A bit away marks a way here 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:56.030
 and let me because times out route without 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.030
 to have another card installed 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.590
 calculated came in a route looks good 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.090
 not really that great out of 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.090
 pretty much goes around the outside 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.860
 but that will be the more precise practice 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 Then show how it feels about the quality 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.850
 the route calculation is ordered that 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.030
 was my first impression of the garmin 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.370
 itraxx touch 35 if you still have questions to ask 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.040
 device has written in the comments 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.870
 you can find the complete practical test 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.669
 on gps radio.de leads the to the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.669
 next time your matthias
