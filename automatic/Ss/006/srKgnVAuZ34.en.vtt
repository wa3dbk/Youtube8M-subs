00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
already there you could just play with

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.290 
already there you could just play with
it<00:01:13.780> my<00:01:14.590> first<00:01:14.950> songs<00:01:15.280> over<00:01:15.759> kind<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.119> like

happy<00:01:16.840> accidents<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.530> think<00:01:17.860> maybe<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.250> fact

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
happy accidents I think maybe the fact

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.550 
happy accidents I think maybe the fact
that<00:01:18.520> i<00:01:18.610> wasn't<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.990> brought<00:01:20.170> up<00:01:20.320> in<00:01:20.440> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
that i wasn't really brought up in the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.410 
that i wasn't really brought up in the
club<00:01:20.740> scene<00:01:20.800> some<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.580> my<00:01:21.610> tracks<00:01:21.940> might<00:01:22.330> have

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
club scene some of my tracks might have

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.760 
club scene some of my tracks might have
sounded<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.810> little<00:01:22.899> more<00:01:23.080> innovative<00:01:23.560> just

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
sounded a little more innovative just

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.109 
sounded a little more innovative just
because<00:01:24.009> they<00:01:24.160> didn't<00:01:24.550> follow<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
because they didn't follow like the

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.880 
because they didn't follow like the
typical<00:01:25.300> dance<00:01:25.630> structure<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.290> was<00:01:26.590> taking

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
rock formulas and applying them to dance

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.109

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
depth I'm a reverb guy for sure I kind

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.610 
depth I'm a reverb guy for sure I kind
of<00:02:32.450> like<00:02:32.630> do<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.959> phil's<00:02:33.230> at<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.440> end<00:02:33.560> of

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
of like do a lot of phil's at the end of

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.940 
of like do a lot of phil's at the end of
each<00:02:33.739> phrase<00:02:34.070> with<00:02:34.250> reverb<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.830> there

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
each phrase with reverb like right there

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
each phrase with reverb like right there

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
phrase and like it'll come in again

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.860 
phrase and like it'll come in again
right<00:02:39.769> here<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:44.090> basically<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.540> cutting

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
right here it's basically just cutting

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.210 
right here it's basically just cutting
it<00:02:44.959> from<00:02:45.110> dry<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.680> way<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
it from dry all the way to like a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.949 
it from dry all the way to like a
hundred<00:02:46.400> percent<00:02:46.580> wet<00:02:46.910> for<00:02:47.180> like<00:02:47.300> half<00:02:47.780> a

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
hundred percent wet for like half a

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.620 
hundred percent wet for like half a
second<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.250> breakdown<00:02:49.700> where<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> fade<00:02:50.450> in

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
second have a breakdown where I fade in

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.410 
second have a breakdown where I fade in
a<00:02:50.930> full<00:02:51.320> chord<00:02:51.650> section<00:02:54.790> right<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.209> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
a full chord section right here on the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.890 
a full chord section right here on the
the<00:02:56.780> modulation<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.980> pitch

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.150 

so<00:03:04.900> pitching<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.380> like<00:03:05.560> as<00:03:05.680> high<00:03:05.830> as<00:03:05.890> it'll

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so pitching it like as high as it'll

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.710 
so pitching it like as high as it'll
possibly<00:03:06.640> go<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:06.970> it's<00:03:07.060> basically<00:03:07.210> jumped<00:03:07.570> me

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
possibly go so it's basically jumped me

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.440 
possibly go so it's basically jumped me
like<00:03:07.900> 40<00:03:08.290> octaves<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:09.010> every<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:10.030> beat<00:03:10.240> four

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
like 40 octaves like every one beat four

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.150 
like 40 octaves like every one beat four
sixteenth<00:03:10.900> note

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.890 

and<00:03:16.580> then<00:03:16.820> like<00:03:17.030> if<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.300> look<00:03:17.750> at<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
and then like if you look at the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.090 
and then like if you look at the
automation

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.660 

I<00:03:23.260> kind<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:24.560> did<00:03:24.800> some<00:03:24.980> more<00:03:25.130> rolls<00:03:25.370> with

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
I kind of like did some more rolls with

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.640 
I kind of like did some more rolls with
it<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.120> like<00:03:26.510> near<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.840> end<00:03:26.990> so<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.380> kind<00:03:27.590> of

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
it so like near the end so it kind of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.010 
it so like near the end so it kind of
really<00:03:27.890> builds<00:03:28.340> up<00:03:28.870> you'll<00:03:29.870> hear<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.200> 129<00:03:32.020> so

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
really builds up you'll hear that 129 so

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.150 
really builds up you'll hear that 129 so
it<00:03:33.080> actually<00:03:33.260> sounds<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.740> someone's<00:03:34.040> like

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
it actually sounds like someone's like

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:49.740 
it actually sounds like someone's like
whipping<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.610> by<00:03:34.730> hand

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.810 

i<00:03:51.630> experiment<00:03:52.630> with<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.260> pitch<00:03:53.470> knob

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
i experiment with like that pitch knob

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.340 
i experiment with like that pitch knob
tainan<00:03:54.820> like<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> lot<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.270> my<00:03:55.330> tracks<00:03:55.570> like<00:03:56.230> the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
tainan like a lot of my tracks like the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.140 
tainan like a lot of my tracks like the
a-side<00:03:56.710> Joker<00:03:57.010> is<00:03:57.250> pretty<00:03:57.550> much<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.760> entire

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
a-side Joker is pretty much the entire

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:16.759 
a-side Joker is pretty much the entire
base<00:03:58.540> line<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.960> is<00:03:59.140> moving<00:03:59.770> that<00:03:59.950> knob<00:04:00.190> around

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.349
