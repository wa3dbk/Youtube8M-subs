 They say that this city takes too 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
 a lot of money and talent to the detriment of others 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.450
 areas 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.420
 but soon things can change tea 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980

 powers worth fails province with 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 a significant number of nationalists 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.430
 Currently local authorities 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.840
 as many powers as u 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.180
 Scotland government 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.760
 but many universities think they need 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 same rights as promised 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 scotland wales must get equal 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 rights with scotland have recently been 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.400
 a number of documents and reports 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
 that enshrines the interparty 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.750
 agreement on the necessary weiss 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.759
 enough power to put off steam

 provide us with a big tax and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 energy autonomy is necessary 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.479
 also hand over to wales the system 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.799
 criminal justice at least partially in

 strongly rejected the idea of ​​getting

 big powers from london then 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.000
 the public has come to the conclusion that this 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 would inevitably lead to an increase in bureaucracy 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 Scottish historian referent 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.549

 additional freedoms and discuss 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.540
 component management principles 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.729
 Britain in the future even counties and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 total population of which 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.719
 comparable to Scotland 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.659
 the size of the economy with the file became in 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.409
 queue for greater autonomy 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.240
 white language 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.829

 uk lets scot 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.910
 solve their problems allows you to do something 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.620
 same about en su and london but new york 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.349
 Sharu we believe that this is wrong 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.019
 big cities also want more power 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.629
 remember the faces of Manchester Newcastle or st. 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.849
 and others require empowerment with 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.849
 same speed as scotland 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.250
 here there is talk that you need to come and 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.239
 ask for money everyone wants to own 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.700
 your future 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.849
 separation of powers over time may 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.319
 completely change uk 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.079
 the interesting thing is that it can affect 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.950
 situations in all of europe this could be 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.379
 just the tip of the iceberg is not surprising that 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.900
 chain reaction triggered by atlans kim 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.430
 the referendum was called a revolution 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.160
 accretion of power 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 The question is how many of these 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.349
 authority 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.069
