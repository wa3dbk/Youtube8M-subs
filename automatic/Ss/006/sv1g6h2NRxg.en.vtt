from the ages of of 22 to 25 who have

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.970 
from the ages of of 22 to 25 who have
grown<00:00:32.369> up<00:00:32.550> together<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.530> they're<00:00:34.829> not

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
grown up together and and they're not

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.010 
grown up together and and they're not
inexperienced<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.090> level<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.510> they've

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
inexperienced at this level now they've

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.639 
inexperienced at this level now they've
got<00:00:37.309> 45<00:00:38.309> 50<00:00:38.670> caps<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.379> would

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.300 
I think when more than capable of going
there<00:03:15.719> and<00:03:15.930> coming<00:03:16.170> back<00:03:16.439> with<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.069> point

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
there and coming back with with a point
