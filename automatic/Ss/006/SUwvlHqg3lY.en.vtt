00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
allow mods on Xbox one I'm gonna be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.440 
allow mods on Xbox one I'm gonna be
talking<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.850> even<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
talking about you know even if that is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
talking about you know even if that is
true<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.799> people<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.100> expecting

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
true it's not what people are expecting

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.940 
true it's not what people are expecting
unfortunately<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:25.380> they<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.650> allow

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
unfortunately because if they do allow

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.609 
unfortunately because if they do allow
mods<00:01:26.189> which<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.880> would<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.619> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
mods which I think they would like I I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.780 
mods which I think they would like I I
think<00:01:28.950> there's<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.159> chance<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.579> wouldn't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
think there's a chance they wouldn't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
think there's a chance they wouldn't
because<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.180> hurt<00:01:30.329> themselves<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
because I would hurt themselves but I

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.569 
because I would hurt themselves but I
really<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> interests<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
really think in the interests of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.010 
really think in the interests of
minecraft<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> follow<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> minecraft

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
minecraft like to follow the minecraft

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
minecraft like to follow the minecraft
principles<00:01:34.409> they'd<00:01:34.560> have<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.829> allow<00:01:34.979> modding

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
principles they'd have to allow modding

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
principles they'd have to allow modding
in<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.850> form<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:36.990> did<00:01:37.140> allow<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
in some form if they did allow it it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
in some form if they did allow it it
wouldn't<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.159> most<00:01:38.310> people<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
wouldn't be what most people think so if

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
wouldn't be what most people think so if
you're<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.049> inter<00:01:40.500> mulling<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.770> PC

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
you're if you're in inter mulling on PC
right<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.000> simple<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.509> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
right now it's really simple to do for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240 
right now it's really simple to do for
Minecraft<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.590> downloading<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> file

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
Minecraft it's just downloading a file

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
Minecraft it's just downloading a file

slipping in your Minecraft folder if you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810 
slipping in your Minecraft folder if you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
game you can use Steamworks on just one

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.929 
game you can use Steamworks on just one
click<00:01:49.710> download<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.369> then<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
click download it and then it's in the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
click download it and then it's in the
game<00:01:51.149> there's<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.259> easy<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.590> get

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
game there's it's really easy to get

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.469 
game there's it's really easy to get
mods<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.979> PC<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
mods on PC now that would not be the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.060 
mods on PC now that would not be the
experience<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> get<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.170> console<00:01:55.619> unless

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
experience you get on console unless

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.679 
experience you get on console unless
there<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> specifically<00:01:57.090> tailored<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
there is a specifically tailored like a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
there is a specifically tailored like a
mod<00:01:58.110> system<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.100> console

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
mod system like that on console

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.609 
mod system like that on console
likely<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.630> happen<00:02:00.899> even<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.229> mods<00:02:01.409> are

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
likely what will happen even if mods are

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.469 
likely what will happen even if mods are
supported<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> allowed<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.299> will

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
supported you know and allowed it will

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
supported you know and allowed it will
still<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.320> type<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> system<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.369> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
still be the type of system we have on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
still be the type of system we have on
xbox360<00:02:06.299> right<00:02:06.689> now<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:07.350> basically<00:02:07.530> what

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
xbox360 right now we're basically what

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
xbox360 right now we're basically what
you<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> USB

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you have to do is you have to get a USB

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.760 
you have to do is you have to get a USB
storage<00:02:09.989> device<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.649> your

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
storage device you have to get your

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.830 
storage device you have to get your
files<00:02:11.009> onto<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.660> get

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
files onto that then you have to get

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
files onto that then you have to get
your<00:02:12.930> PC<00:02:13.260> of

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
your PC of

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.160 
your PC of
to<00:02:13.820> programming<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.420> make<00:02:14.450> most<00:02:14.780> mods<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
to programming to make most mods that

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.050 
to programming to make most mods that
happen<00:02:15.470> there<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:16.100> get<00:02:16.250> over<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.580> Xbox<00:02:16.910> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
happen there then get over the Xbox and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.120 
happen there then get over the Xbox and
likely<00:02:17.750> will<00:02:18.020> still<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.380> limited<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> same

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
likely will still be limited in the same

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.770 
likely will still be limited in the same
way<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.880> Xbox<00:02:20.210> 60<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.660> you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
way like right now on Xbox 60 if you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.180 
way like right now on Xbox 60 if you
know<00:02:20.900> where<00:02:21.110> there<00:02:21.470> are<00:02:21.620> mods<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.980> can

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
know where there are mods you can

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.740 
know where there are mods you can
download<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.760> get<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.480> have<00:02:23.660> all

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
download and get going if you have all

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.300 
download and get going if you have all
the<00:02:23.810> necessary<00:02:23.930> equipment<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:24.830> most<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.190> them

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
the necessary equipment but most of them

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.590 
the necessary equipment but most of them
don't<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:25.760> do<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.910> whole<00:02:26.120> bunch<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.450> you

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
don't really do a whole bunch like you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.330 
don't really do a whole bunch like you
can<00:02:26.870> get<00:02:27.110> some<00:02:27.260> extra<00:02:27.470> texture<00:02:27.680> packs<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.310> can

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
can get some extra texture packs you can

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.310 
can get some extra texture packs you can
get<00:02:28.760> some<00:02:29.030> really<00:02:29.300> weird<00:02:29.450> mods<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:30.200> make

get some really weird mods that make

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.170 
get some really weird mods that make
like<00:02:30.560> giant<00:02:30.920> zombies<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.310> stuff<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.820> besides

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
console console that there isn't really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.430

any<00:02:40.670> big<00:02:41.030> mods<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.660> console<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.110> now<00:02:42.230> even

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
any big mods on console right now even

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.900 
any big mods on console right now even
though<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.770> technically<00:02:43.220> happening<00:02:43.700> even

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
though it's technically happening even

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.460 
though it's technically happening even
if<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.090> mild<00:02:44.210> out<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.930> fact<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.290> being

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
if it's mild out the fact it's being

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.260 
if it's mild out the fact it's being
allowed<00:02:45.710> just<00:02:45.950> means<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.370> can<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.940> so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
allowed just means we can do that so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.490 
allowed just means we can do that so
let's<00:02:47.450> focus<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:47.870> mods<00:02:48.050> could<00:02:48.350> be

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
let's focus on what mods could be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.530 
let's focus on what mods could be
happening<00:02:48.800> on<00:02:48.920> Xbox<00:02:49.250> one<00:02:49.460> if<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.210> supported

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
happening on Xbox one if it is supported

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.570 
happening on Xbox one if it is supported
properly<00:02:50.870> by<00:02:51.050> 4j<00:02:51.350> which<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.680> imagine<00:02:52.160> as<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> said

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
properly by 4j which I imagine as I said

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.100 
properly by 4j which I imagine as I said
it<00:02:52.700> would<00:02:52.880> be<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.420> first<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.750> all<00:02:53.780> we'd<00:02:53.930> be<00:02:54.020> able

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
it would be so first of all we'd be able

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.420 
it would be so first of all we'd be able
to<00:02:54.200> see<00:02:54.290> lots<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.470> cosmetic<00:02:54.590> stuff<00:02:55.070> happening

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
to see lots of cosmetic stuff happening

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.880 
to see lots of cosmetic stuff happening
so<00:02:55.730> um<00:02:56.110> there'd<00:02:57.110> be<00:02:57.200> mods<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.620> would<00:02:57.709> allow

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
so um there'd be mods that would allow

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.830 
so um there'd be mods that would allow
me<00:02:58.220> no<00:02:58.280> more<00:02:58.490> skin<00:02:58.760> packs<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.360> instead<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.660> just

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
me no more skin packs so instead of just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.180 
me no more skin packs so instead of just
having<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.140> buy<00:03:00.410> skin<00:03:00.740> packs<00:03:00.920> which<00:03:01.040> i<00:03:01.130> think

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
having to buy skin packs which i think

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.430 
having to buy skin packs which i think
is<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.760> lame<00:03:02.120> thing<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.990> can<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:03.290> any

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
is really a lame thing you can get any

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960 
is really a lame thing you can get any
skin<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.860> want<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.280> probably<00:03:04.610> be<00:03:04.730> something

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
skin you want that probably be something

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.240 
skin you want that probably be something
for<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.270> very<00:03:05.600> quickly<00:03:05.900> more<00:03:06.709> texture<00:03:07.070> packs

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
for that very quickly more texture packs

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.430 
for that very quickly more texture packs
would<00:03:07.370> definitely<00:03:07.760> happen<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.240> PC<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.870> Xbox

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
would definitely happen so PC to Xbox

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.470 
would definitely happen so PC to Xbox
one<00:03:09.590> text<00:03:10.070> pack<00:03:10.190> convert<00:03:10.580> would<00:03:11.030> definitely

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
one text pack convert would definitely

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.520 
one text pack convert would definitely
start<00:03:11.690> happening<00:03:12.020> now<00:03:12.140> they're<00:03:12.290> definitely

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
start happening now they're definitely

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.740 
start happening now they're definitely
not<00:03:12.740> allowed<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.430> think<00:03:13.760> those<00:03:14.270> those<00:03:14.600> would

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
not allowed I think those those would

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.300 
not allowed I think those those would
start<00:03:14.959> happening<00:03:15.080> lots<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.800> cool<00:03:15.980> things<00:03:16.220> like

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
start happening lots of cool things like

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.920 
start happening lots of cool things like
that<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.820> because<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.240> course<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.720> way<00:03:17.840> it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
that and because of course the way it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.690 
that and because of course the way it
works<00:03:18.110> that'll<00:03:18.440> be<00:03:18.560> entirely<00:03:19.070> free<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.430> it'd

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
works that'll be entirely free and it'd

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.370 
works that'll be entirely free and it'd
be<00:03:19.820> nice<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.540> they<00:03:20.690> get<00:03:20.870> still<00:03:21.050> gonna<00:03:21.170> require

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
be nice but they get still gonna require

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.840 
be nice but they get still gonna require
a<00:03:21.440> lot<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.590> effort<00:03:21.709> that's<00:03:22.040> up<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.519> think<00:03:22.730> will

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
a lot of effort that's up I think will

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.070 
a lot of effort that's up I think will
almost<00:03:23.000> definitely<00:03:23.300> be<00:03:23.630> happening<00:03:23.989> because

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
almost definitely be happening because

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.710 
almost definitely be happening because
even<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:24.440> on<00:03:24.800> Xbox<00:03:25.519> 360<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.090> can<00:03:26.330> get<00:03:26.510> text

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
even now on Xbox 360 you can get text

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.600 
even now on Xbox 360 you can get text
packs<00:03:26.900> have<00:03:27.019> you<00:03:27.140> mob<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> men<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.250> if<00:03:28.310> Xbox

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
packs have you mob the men so if Xbox

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.490 
packs have you mob the men so if Xbox
one<00:03:28.790> web<00:03:29.030> muncipal<00:03:29.450> officially<00:03:30.080> allowed<00:03:30.260> it'd

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
one web muncipal officially allowed it'd

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.770 
one web muncipal officially allowed it'd
be<00:03:30.650> easier<00:03:30.890> but<00:03:31.790> getting<00:03:31.940> stuff<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.300> you

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
be easier but getting stuff like you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.270 
be easier but getting stuff like you
know<00:03:32.870> people<00:03:33.140> really<00:03:33.170> want<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.830> tickets

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.490 
not late to happen in console so first
of<00:03:38.269> all<00:03:38.300> there's<00:03:38.959> not<00:03:39.050> going<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.290> many

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
save files of the world itself so maybe

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.420

chance that we'll get some more fun
things<00:04:41.389> because<00:04:41.719> modern<00:04:42.110> being<00:04:42.379> loud<00:04:42.590> will

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
things because modern being loud will

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.959 
things because modern being loud will
mean<00:04:42.919> more<00:04:43.069> people<00:04:43.310> would<00:04:43.400> do<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.639> which

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
mean more people would do it which

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.029 
mean more people would do it which
hopefully<00:04:44.210> means<00:04:44.479> some<00:04:45.020> interesting<00:04:45.800> stuff

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
hopefully means some interesting stuff

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
through the effort of making let's say

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.959 
through the effort of making let's say
you<00:04:54.680> know<00:04:54.889> feed<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:55.219> beast<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.550> console

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
you know feed the beast on console

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.540 
you know feed the beast on console
because<00:04:56.770> minecraft<00:04:57.770> is<00:04:57.919> optimized<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.460> run

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
because minecraft is optimized to run

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.219 
because minecraft is optimized to run
the<00:04:58.699> base<00:04:58.909> game<00:04:59.180> at<00:04:59.479> you<00:04:59.689> know<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.900> perfect

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
the base game at you know the perfect

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.019 
the base game at you know the perfect
frame<00:05:00.409> rate<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:01.129> will<00:05:01.400> still<00:05:01.639> have<00:05:01.759> framerate

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:02.029 
frame rate it will still have framerate

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.420 
frame rate it will still have framerate
issues<00:05:02.330> on<00:05:02.659> consoles<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.379> it's<00:05:03.889> not<00:05:04.189> going<00:05:04.370> to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
issues on consoles so it's not going to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.040 
issues on consoles so it's not going to
be<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.669> perfect<00:05:05.000> console<00:05:05.270> experience<00:05:05.449> in<00:05:05.810> if

be the perfect console experience in if

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.689 
be the perfect console experience in if
you<00:05:06.169> do<00:05:06.379> get<00:05:06.529> the<00:05:06.650> mods<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:06.979> that<00:05:07.189> and<00:05:07.370> so

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
you do get the mods like that and so

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.550 
you do get the mods like that and so
yeah<00:05:07.819> that's<00:05:08.000> my<00:05:08.270> opinions<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.169> mod<00:05:09.379> support

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
yeah that's my opinions on mod support

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.980 
yeah that's my opinions on mod support
and<00:05:09.889> you<00:05:10.129> know<00:05:10.250> I<00:05:10.430> guess<00:05:10.699> my<00:05:11.029> opinions<00:05:11.750> plus

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
and you know I guess my opinions plus

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.929 
and you know I guess my opinions plus
knowledge<00:05:12.349> on<00:05:12.529> what<00:05:12.650> support<00:05:12.949> I<00:05:13.279> think<00:05:13.849> it'd

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:13.939 
knowledge on what support I think it'd

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.459 
knowledge on what support I think it'd
be<00:05:13.969> really<00:05:14.060> cool<00:05:14.389> it's<00:05:14.750> almost<00:05:15.199> definitely

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:15.469 
be really cool it's almost definitely

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.350 
be really cool it's almost definitely
gonna<00:05:15.740> be<00:05:15.860> allowed<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.550> think<00:05:16.819> it'll<00:05:17.150> allow

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
gonna be allowed and I think it'll allow

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.089 
gonna be allowed and I think it'll allow
more<00:05:17.599> things<00:05:17.900> but<00:05:18.319> it's<00:05:18.439> not<00:05:18.680> going<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.919> be

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
more things but it's not going to be

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.519 
more things but it's not going to be
that<00:05:19.849> much<00:05:20.090> more<00:05:20.150> because<00:05:20.870> even

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
that much more because even

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.709 
that much more because even
realistically<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.520> can<00:05:22.759> model<00:05:23.120> next<00:05:23.240> book<00:05:23.389> 60

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:23.719 
realistically you can model next book 60

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.510 
realistically you can model next book 60
right<00:05:23.870> now<00:05:24.020> just<00:05:24.680> being<00:05:24.889> allowed<00:05:25.099> to<00:05:25.279> do<00:05:25.400> it

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
right now just being allowed to do it

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.129 
right now just being allowed to do it
isn't<00:05:25.789> going<00:05:25.909> to<00:05:25.969> help<00:05:26.060> much<00:05:26.330> more<00:05:26.509> happen<00:05:26.779> so

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
isn't going to help much more happen so

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.629 
isn't going to help much more happen so
