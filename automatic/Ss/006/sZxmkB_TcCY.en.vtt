all the way just a little ways in you
try<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> torque<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> right<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.000> or<00:00:24.029> spend<00:00:24.300> it

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
try to torque it right now or spend it

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.790 
try to torque it right now or spend it
way<00:00:24.600> down<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:24.990> won't<00:00:25.170> clear<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.439> center

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
way down there won't clear the center

up<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.680> light<00:01:17.180> make<00:01:18.180> sure<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.390> wires

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
up to two light make sure my wires

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.170 
up to two light make sure my wires
aren't<00:01:18.869> bound<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.680> occasionally<00:01:20.670> on

aren't bound up in there occasionally on
this<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.759> wiring<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.390> can

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
this one you will see the wiring I can

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.109 
this one you will see the wiring I can
get<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.900> them<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> lot<00:01:25.259> correctly<00:01:26.119> there's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
get it on them a lot correctly there's

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.390 
get it on them a lot correctly there's
the<00:01:27.450> six<00:01:27.720> holes<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.290> around<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.619> ring<00:01:28.920> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the six holes going around this ring we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.679 
the six holes going around this ring we
just<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> fasten<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.390> with

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
just go over going to fasten down with

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.679 
just go over going to fasten down with
they've<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.619> covered<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.540> one<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
they've actually covered up one of the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.200 
they've actually covered up one of the
holes<00:01:34.220> rather<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.400> being<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.880> wires

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
holes rather than being these wires

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
holes rather than being these wires
we're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.140> tray<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we're going to use this tray in a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.130 
we're going to use this tray in a
certain<00:01:38.820> configuration<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> Bo<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
certain configuration in the Bo as it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
certain configuration in the Bo as it
shows<00:01:40.380> three<00:01:40.650> boats<00:01:40.860> from<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> top<00:01:41.310> three

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
shows three boats from the top three

shows three boats from the top three
boats<00:01:42.450> from<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> bottom<00:01:43.049> we'll<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:43.409> sure<00:01:43.560> we

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
boats from the bottom we'll make sure we

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.730 
boats from the bottom we'll make sure we
use<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.009> mount<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.720> where<00:01:45.899> our<00:01:46.049> six

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
use this mount and to where our six

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.399 
use this mount and to where our six
boats<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.250> positioned<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.380> none<00:01:49.380> of
