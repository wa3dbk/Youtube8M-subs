it'll<00:04:43.360> all<00:04:43.540> come<00:04:43.570> together<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.380> full<00:04:44.710> circle<00:04:45.190> I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
it'll all come together in full circle I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.470 
it'll all come together in full circle I
I<00:04:46.060> particularly<00:04:46.720> like<00:04:47.110> when<00:04:47.560> she<00:04:48.070> has<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.480> paint

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
I particularly like when she has a paint

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.220 
I particularly like when she has a paint
on<00:04:49.630> papers<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.470> then<00:04:51.340> use<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.270> papers<00:04:52.660> then

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
on papers and then use the papers then

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.520 
on papers and then use the papers then
still<00:04:53.650> work<00:04:54.640> into<00:04:55.060> those<00:04:55.210> papers<00:04:55.660> again<00:04:55.960> pull

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
still work into those papers again pull

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.880 
still work into those papers again pull
the<00:04:56.740> papers<00:04:57.160> there's<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.700> lot<00:04:57.910> of<00:04:58.710> addition<00:04:59.710> and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
the papers there's a lot of addition and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.160 
the papers there's a lot of addition and
subtraction<00:05:00.640> with<00:05:00.880> what<00:05:01.060> she<00:05:01.240> does<00:05:01.450> so<00:05:01.720> in

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
subtraction with what she does so in

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.810 
subtraction with what she does so in
certain<00:05:02.410> aspects<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.220> can<00:05:03.370> be<00:05:03.490> kind<00:05:03.730> of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
certain aspects it can be kind of

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.200 
certain aspects it can be kind of
sculptural<00:05:04.350> so<00:05:05.350> that's<00:05:06.220> part<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:06.910> reason

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
sculptural so that's part of the reason

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.300 
sculptural so that's part of the reason
that<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.360> love<00:05:07.570> collage<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.230> it's<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:08.620> tactile

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
that I love collage and it's so tactile

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.210 
that I love collage and it's so tactile
and<00:05:09.700> she<00:05:10.210> when<00:05:10.660> she<00:05:10.870> makes<00:05:11.080> stamps<00:05:11.800> when<00:05:11.980> she

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
and she when she makes stamps when she

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.150 
and she when she makes stamps when she
rolls<00:05:12.550> when<00:05:12.970> she<00:05:13.210> prints<00:05:13.810> there's<00:05:14.410> all<00:05:14.830> those

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
rolls when she prints there's all those

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.240 
rolls when she prints there's all those
elements<00:05:15.430> there<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:17.410> combine

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
elements there that that combine

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.950 
elements there that that combine
together<00:05:18.640> to<00:05:18.970> make<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.510> sort<00:05:19.870> of

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
together to make this sort of

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.470 
together to make this sort of
magnificent<00:05:22.110> piece<00:05:24.150> you're<00:05:25.150> giving

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
magnificent piece you're giving

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.320 
magnificent piece you're giving
directional<00:05:26.140> signals<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.160> viewer<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.730> mean

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
directional signals to the viewer I mean

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.600 
directional signals to the viewer I mean
it's<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.540> tall<00:05:28.780> relationship<00:05:29.650> you're<00:05:30.250> making

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
it's a tall relationship you're making

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.040 
it's a tall relationship you're making
something<00:05:30.820> somebody<00:05:31.300> else<00:05:31.360> is<00:05:31.600> going<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.780> view

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
something somebody else is going to view

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.460 
something somebody else is going to view
it<00:05:32.110> okay<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.400> so<00:05:33.880> everything<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:34.990> do<00:05:35.200> is

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
it okay and so everything you do is

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.990 
it okay and so everything you do is
going<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.650> influence<00:05:35.920> how<00:05:36.250> that<00:05:36.400> person<00:05:36.760> looks

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
going to influence how that person looks

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.810 
going to influence how that person looks
at<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:38.050> this<00:05:38.260> can<00:05:38.440> also<00:05:38.530> be<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> way<00:05:39.220> in<00:05:39.250> this

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
at it now this can also be a way in this

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.140 
at it now this can also be a way in this
way<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:41.110> out<00:05:41.530> that<00:05:41.860> way<00:05:42.100> okay<00:05:42.730> so<00:05:42.790> this<00:05:43.000> is

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
way and out that way okay so this is

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.150 
way and out that way okay so this is
this<00:05:43.360> now<00:05:43.960> what<00:05:44.170> it<00:05:44.290> also<00:05:44.500> creates<00:05:45.040> is

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
this now what it also creates is

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.300 
this now what it also creates is
movement<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:46.030> composition<00:05:46.660> creates<00:05:46.990> movement

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
movement so composition creates movement

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.660 
movement so composition creates movement
now<00:05:48.310> if<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.610> have<00:05:48.790> a<00:05:48.820> piece<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:50.490> you<00:05:51.490> just

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
now if you have a piece and you just

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.920 
now if you have a piece and you just
have<00:05:51.850> things<00:05:52.120> right<00:05:52.720> in<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.050> middle<00:05:54.930> shapes

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
have things right in the middle shapes

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.860 
have things right in the middle shapes
kind<00:05:56.260> of<00:05:56.320> in<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.530> middle<00:05:58.140> it's<00:05:59.140> more<00:05:59.350> static

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
kind of in the middle it's more static

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.689 
kind of in the middle it's more static
the<00:06:01.139> second<00:06:01.650> you<00:06:01.770> have<00:06:01.980> a<00:06:02.010> feeling<00:06:02.580> of

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
the second you have a feeling of

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.680 
the second you have a feeling of
something<00:06:02.910> else<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:05.490> kind<00:06:05.699> of<00:06:05.760> creates<00:06:06.180> the

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
something else it kind of creates the

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.659 
something else it kind of creates the
feeling<00:06:06.900> of<00:06:07.110> things<00:06:07.350> shifting<00:06:08.310> through

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
feeling of things shifting through

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.550 
feeling of things shifting through
shifting<00:06:09.419> on<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.870> off<00:06:09.990> like<00:06:10.260> looking<00:06:10.530> through

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
shifting on and off like looking through

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.010 
shifting on and off like looking through
a<00:06:10.740> microscope<00:06:10.919> and<00:06:11.490> seeing<00:06:11.729> little<00:06:12.510> amoebas

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
a microscope and seeing little amoebas

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.110 
a microscope and seeing little amoebas
moving<00:06:13.410> around<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.770> creates<00:06:14.250> movement<00:06:14.639> to

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
moving around it creates movement to

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.969 
moving around it creates movement to
have<00:06:15.270> things<00:06:15.540> moving<00:06:15.990> in<00:06:16.080> and<00:06:16.290> off<00:06:16.380> at<00:06:16.889> the

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
have things moving in and off at the

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.520 
have things moving in and off at the
edges<00:06:17.340> the<00:06:17.880> other<00:06:18.000> thing<00:06:18.240> is<00:06:18.449> that<00:06:18.479> when<00:06:19.410> you

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
edges the other thing is that when you

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.090 
edges the other thing is that when you
have<00:06:19.770> a<00:06:21.410> horizon<00:06:22.410> line<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.590> talked<00:06:22.800> about<00:06:22.830> this

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
have a horizon line I talked about this

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.129 
have a horizon line I talked about this
yesterday<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:24.150> horizon<00:06:24.720> line<00:06:24.870> in<00:06:25.080> the

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
yesterday the horizon line in the

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.070 
yesterday the horizon line in the
landscape<00:06:25.620> just<00:06:25.650> creates<00:06:26.370> automatic<00:06:27.210> like<00:06:27.900> an

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
landscape just creates automatic like an

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.200 
landscape just creates automatic like an
anchoring<00:06:28.740> you<00:06:29.010> have<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.639> earth

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
anchoring you have the earth

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.060 
anchoring you have the earth
you<00:06:30.419> have<00:06:30.570> the<00:06:30.690> sky<00:06:30.930> it's<00:06:31.260> just<00:06:31.410> automatic

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
you have the sky it's just automatic

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.760 
you have the sky it's just automatic
kind<00:06:32.250> of<00:06:32.340> feeling<00:06:32.850> of<00:06:33.000> we<00:06:33.990> just<00:06:34.169> get<00:06:34.290> grounded

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
kind of feeling of we just get grounded

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.219 
kind of feeling of we just get grounded
