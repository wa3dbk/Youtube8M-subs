piled<00:00:18.439> up<00:00:18.619> and<00:00:18.890> so<00:00:19.460> I<00:00:19.699> finally<00:00:20.329> decided<00:00:20.689> that

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
piled up and so I finally decided that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.040 
piled up and so I finally decided that
the<00:00:21.529> heroic<00:00:21.949> version<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.789> twins<00:00:23.089> deserves

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
the heroic version of the twins deserves

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.249 
the heroic version of the twins deserves
an<00:00:24.349> your<00:00:24.589> video<00:00:25.029> it<00:00:26.029> deserves<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.869> new<00:00:27.019> video

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
an your video it deserves a new video

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.739 
an your video it deserves a new video
because<00:00:27.949> there<00:00:28.189> is<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.339> different<00:00:28.909> strategy<00:00:29.239> to

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:29.749 
because there is a different strategy to

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.409 
because there is a different strategy to
talk<00:00:29.929> about<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.679> I'm<00:00:31.310> not<00:00:31.550> saying<00:00:31.849> that<00:00:32.029> the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
talk about and I'm not saying that the

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.139 
talk about and I'm not saying that the
normal<00:00:32.750> strategy<00:00:33.379> can't<00:00:33.620> work<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:34.910> also

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
normal strategy can't work that one also

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.099 
normal strategy can't work that one also
works<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.559> can<00:00:36.769> also<00:00:36.949> try<00:00:37.280> with<00:00:37.519> this<00:00:37.699> one

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
works but you can also try with this one

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.099 
works but you can also try with this one
so<00:00:39.109> this<00:00:39.649> is<00:00:39.679> the<00:00:39.920> cliff<00:00:40.429> strategy<00:00:41.149> actually

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
so this is the cliff strategy actually

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.310 
so this is the cliff strategy actually
the<00:00:42.410> cliff<00:00:42.710> doorway<00:00:43.460> strategy<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.449> it<00:00:45.109> is

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the cliff doorway strategy and it is

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.069 
the cliff doorway strategy and it is
based<00:00:45.589> on<00:00:45.920> two<00:00:46.190> major<00:00:46.429> components<00:00:46.809> you<00:00:47.809> keep

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
based on two major components you keep

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.650 
based on two major components you keep
the<00:00:48.230> bosses<00:00:48.469> close<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.190> each<00:00:49.309> other<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.910> you

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
the bosses close to each other and you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.799 
the bosses close to each other and you
don't<00:00:50.960> switch<00:00:51.230> color<00:00:52.390> starting<00:00:53.390> from<00:00:53.660> the
