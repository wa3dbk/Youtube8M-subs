00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:13.559
 unbelievable I saw a movie 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 and from him I want to tell you in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.720
 a method before is called a german 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.039
 swedish english production and it 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
 go around 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.869
 it is about the following an expedition in the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 1939 marks the end of 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 several scientists around in the me 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
 Something like that somewhere in Scandinavia 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
 north in the arctic or something 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 Find out if it still traces and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.550
 remnants are the theory that prove 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 all continents were 1 earlier and these 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 Scientists are now on one 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.120
 mission to find the traces that the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.120
 to prove 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.940
 two english one swede two german 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 Of course it's also the eve 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.160
 the second world war hitler is already 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
 at power and it does not look 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.549
 especially good with there being good 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.380
 this is done for a bad game 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.090
 German scientists are happy 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.710
 with her English and Swedish 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.030
 Colleagues have to work together 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.400
 He even plaques from Berlin 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 brought by that they are always on in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.509
 Hitler's Germany are welcome 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.299
 Well and then comes over the radio 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 message purely okay Germany I have 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.580
 believe poland or so declared the war 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580
 it starts 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.790
 before 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.430
 from then critical because this is obviously 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.780
 researchers, of course, all already 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.620
 with each other at least a few now 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.300
 days are out and about 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.460
 but have met now suddenly 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.620
 for hostile regimes more or 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 less work there are in the rows 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.250
 then even a defector and it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.190
 gets insanely confusing on this 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.140
 Ship on which 15 all persons work 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.850
 these five people suddenly arrive 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.070
 absolute confusion where you can not anymore 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.630
 So who knows exactly who is fighting here 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.710
 suddenly against whom and why is one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.520
 Scientists fight at all 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.970
 it's marie christin on politics 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.730
 the question of sale escalated him live 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.709
 of course, heading for one 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.450
 a clear highlight but that way 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.120
 the rough story of in a method 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.070
 front axel boastful and jeanette hain play 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.870
 from German side with axel prahl 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.709
 plays this german scientist 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.450
 totally great on the one hand so much 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.240
 But this Hitler Germany believes 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.100
 out of his naivety because he 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.930
 obviously as a scientist like that 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.250
 The new one is on the way 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 not so many thoughts about politics 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.000
 makes one it is very glad that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.040
 this government that is then makes 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.180
 just as this political thinking decreases 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
 So of course especially the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.290
 English people are of the opinion does us 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.900
 sorry so we see you there and how 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.760
 but that's not good 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.230
 government that is not good thing there 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.260
 can not happen from such a boat 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.850
 man away and take care of such a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.500
 permanent confrontation and one 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.960
 permanent conflict between 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:07.780
 The characters then start a hunt 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:10.670
 So suite a mexico 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.920
 What I liked a movie is 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.630
 that's just synonymous with this topic 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.790
 as background it was then 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.710
 surprisingly entertaining because 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.560
 almost the fear of the figures in front of each other 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.030
 true and and the tension also given 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.160
 is and is not so noticeable 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.930
 with so text explains all the time 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.790
 but takes a lot for granted 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.740
 and the characters just act on 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.870
 You have to finish at the big finale 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.180
 fall back on the par animations 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.180
 and since you have to say which of course 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.500
 not good but you can 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.150
 forgive because that needs that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.460
 story after that fast and that are 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.420
 not too long to see why 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.990
 that's why it's ok you can 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.970
 to swallow 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.520
 that's an interesting movie 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.050
 I think people can inspire the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.790
 so historical stuffs are so 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.170
 just what the second world war time 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.270
 concerns I think that can even 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.290
 I like watching crime sometimes 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.050
 the feeling had that too 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 easy crime feeling situation 1939 man 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.360
 may not be the big action now 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.640
 lickers are expected now too 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.560
 not the super subtle spence 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.630
 hitchcock script but expect if 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.320
 one bock has exciting on so well 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.850
 thriller during the Nazi period then you are with it 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.970
 the film served equally well therefore 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.570
 I give it clearly yes what will you give then 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.710
 such a case 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:28.370
 three out of five Swedish moose 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.040
 Swedish arctic ice elk for 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.240
 this for a metaphor so if now 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.050
 was about to have feeling for it 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.940
 again film looks like 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.300
 here is the trailer to use in a method 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.680
 before and another german film the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.420
 Amazingly great computer effects underneath 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.930
 Other criticism you have to see 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:50.000
 here ruby ​​red then click now 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.170
 on one of these two windows the here 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.930
 walk on my side to continue there 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.160
 to be able to watch 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.830
 I'll be right away 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.810
 Here I am right away but I live 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.970
 Continue to your computer but here I am 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.110
 Immediately away and then you can me 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.940
 Do not see it here when it returns 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.600
 plays but now that is here now 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.280
 over and then I disappeared 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.510
 I do not count to 300 ok and then 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.009
 to have gotten a bit else 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.339
 is 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.339
 I'm gone 12
