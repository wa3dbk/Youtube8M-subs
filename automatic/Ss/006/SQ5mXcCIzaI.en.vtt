through microtransactions the game has a
wide<00:02:27.700> variety<00:02:27.880> of<00:02:28.300> levels<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.750> play<00:02:28.900> through

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
wide variety of levels to play through

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.680 
wide variety of levels to play through
but<00:02:29.890> they're<00:02:30.400> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.970> Model<00:02:31.210> T<00:02:31.240> in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
but they're kind of like the Model T in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.020 
but they're kind of like the Model T in
that<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.740> can<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.010> any<00:02:33.160> color<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.550> want<00:02:33.580> so

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
that you can have any color you want so

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
that you can have any color you want so
long<00:02:34.060> as<00:02:34.270> it's<00:02:34.690> black<00:02:34.900> essentially<00:02:35.560> many<00:02:35.770> of

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
long as it's black essentially many of

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.800 
long as it's black essentially many of
the<00:02:36.130> levels<00:02:36.459> of<00:02:36.520> look<00:02:36.700> alike<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.690> due<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the levels of look alike this is due to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.600 
the levels of look alike this is due to
the<00:02:37.930> fact<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> game<00:02:38.620> uses<00:02:38.860> procedural

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the fact that the game uses procedural

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.660 
the fact that the game uses procedural
level<00:02:39.970> generation<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.950> all<00:02:42.100> reality<00:02:42.280> though

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
level generation in all reality though

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:55.050 
level generation in all reality though
the<00:02:42.850> levels<00:02:43.150> don't<00:02:43.300> get<00:02:43.450> boring<00:02:43.810> despite<00:02:44.350> this

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.150 

in<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.180> end<00:02:56.300> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.020> great<00:02:57.530> co-op<00:02:58.130> shooter

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
in the end this is a great co-op shooter

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.130 
in the end this is a great co-op shooter
and<00:02:58.670> one<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.090> would<00:02:59.420> definitely<00:02:59.720> recommend

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
and one I would definitely recommend

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.949 
and one I would definitely recommend
checking<00:03:00.680> out<00:03:01.190> especially<00:03:01.819> since<00:03:02.630> it's<00:03:02.780> free

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
checking out especially since it's free

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.910 
checking out especially since it's free
and<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.150> Jon<00:03:05.390> wishing<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.080> good<00:03:06.290> dead

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and so this is Jon wishing you good dead

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.699 
and so this is Jon wishing you good dead
space<00:03:07.069> good<00:03:07.760> dead<00:03:08.270> space<00:03:08.390> 2<00:03:08.690> or<00:03:09.200> whatever

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
space good dead space 2 or whatever

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.730 
space good dead space 2 or whatever
