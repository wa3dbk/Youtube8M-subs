and<00:00:39.570> same<00:00:39.780> number<00:00:40.020> 20<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.440> having<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
and same number 20 I'm having about that

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.340 
and same number 20 I'm having about that
but<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.690> hoping<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.050> maybe<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
but I was really hoping like maybe a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
but I was really hoping like maybe a
card<00:00:43.620> card<00:00:43.829> d<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.059> number<00:00:45.329> 11<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
card card d or you know number 11 that

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
card card d or you know number 11 that
way<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.260> those<00:00:46.379> cards<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.800> easier<00:00:47.219> for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
way you know those cards be easier for

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.470 
way you know those cards be easier for
people<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.300> they've<00:00:48.450> been

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
people to get because they've been

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
people to get because they've been
they're<00:00:48.870> pretty<00:00:49.050> hot<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.350> price<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.770> now<00:00:49.920> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
they're pretty hot in price right now so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
they're pretty hot in price right now so
yeah<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.030> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.300> few<00:00:51.480> even<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.750> those

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

unfortunately not though but maybe we'll

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.220 
unfortunately not though but maybe we'll
have<00:00:54.149> another<00:00:54.210> reprint<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> those<00:00:54.899> sometime

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

which is number 61 number 19 fries are
done<00:01:06.619> also<00:01:07.619> radiates<00:01:08.100> photon<00:01:08.400> perdio<00:01:08.790> switch

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
done also radiates photon perdio switch

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
done also radiates photon perdio switch
is<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.630> believe<00:01:09.810> kaitou<00:01:10.290> uses<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.979> know

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
is I believe kaitou uses that one I know

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.859 
is I believe kaitou uses that one I know
it's<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> his<00:01:11.490> cards<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.360> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it's one of his cards I don't I don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's one of his cards I don't I don't
think<00:01:13.170> I've<00:01:13.229> seen<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> show<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.740> actually

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
think I've seen the show we actually

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469 
think I've seen the show we actually
uses<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> though<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.880> course<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.330> haven't

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
uses it though of course I haven't

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.420 
uses it though of course I haven't
watched<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> anime<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.990> while<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
watched the anime a while but it is a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.670 
watched the anime a while but it is a
really<00:01:18.000> awesome<00:01:18.150> card<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.320> course<00:01:19.350> all

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
really awesome card and of course all

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.870 
really awesome card and of course all
the<00:01:19.860> photon<00:01:20.159> stuff<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.700> actually

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the photon stuff is I'm actually

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.330 
the photon stuff is I'm actually
extremely<00:01:21.720> excited<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.740> photon

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
extremely excited about this photon

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.789 
extremely excited about this photon
galaxy<00:01:23.850> support<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.750> photons<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.680> can

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
galaxy support because photons are can

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
galaxy support because photons are can
be<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.340> competitive<00:01:27.060> now<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> lot

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
be way more competitive now me a lot

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.289 
be way more competitive now me a lot
more<00:01:28.049> fun<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.650> mean<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.520> probably<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.090> me

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
more fun I mean I know probably like me

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.190 
more fun I mean I know probably like me
something<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:30.990> over<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
something that's gonna take over the
