was I'm guessing like over over a month
maybe<00:02:39.400> six<00:02:39.790> weeks<00:02:40.090> would<00:02:40.269> be<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> good<00:02:40.569> estimate

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489

but the problem with bluetooth is that

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.160 
but the problem with bluetooth is that
it<00:03:12.130> needs<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.520> neat<00:03:12.910> sound<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:13.780> more<00:03:13.930> than<00:03:14.050> a

to actually hear it so I get no warning
but<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.060> figured<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.150> out<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.870> spent<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> lot<00:03:38.320> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
but I figured it out I spent a lot of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.660 
but I figured it out I spent a lot of
time<00:03:38.560> trying<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.860> figure<00:03:38.980> out<00:03:39.160> how<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.310> do<00:03:39.520> this

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
time trying to figure out how to do this

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.350 
time trying to figure out how to do this
and<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.540> finally<00:03:41.050> got<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.070> um<00:03:42.360> it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
and I finally got it so that it um it

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.050 
and I finally got it so that it um it
will<00:03:43.540> warn<00:03:43.930> me<00:03:44.110> now<00:03:44.260> it'll<00:03:44.740> actually<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.850> a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.660 
your speed to and it'll save the amount
50<00:03:52.360> or<00:03:52.510> 60<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.020> whatever<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:54.400> pretty

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.790 
and there's a speed camera on the right
now

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
now

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.550 
now
it<00:04:34.039> was<00:04:34.190> placed<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.610> left<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:36.289> is<00:04:36.409> like

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
it was placed on the left this is like

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.710 
it was placed on the left this is like
see<00:04:36.979> this<00:04:37.099> is<00:04:37.280> insane<00:04:37.610> I'm<00:04:38.210> doing<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.509> speed

limit right now and it feels like my

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.249 
limit right now and it feels like my
bikes<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.550> stall<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.870> imagine<00:04:42.199> just

road doing this speed like ouch i'm
already<00:04:46.370> speeding<00:04:46.729> up<00:04:46.960> 355

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
already speeding up 355

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330 
already speeding up 355
like<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.139> know<00:04:50.229> I<00:04:50.289> could<00:04:50.500> get<00:04:50.650> up<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.860> walk<00:04:51.069> it

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
like you know I could get up and walk it

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.270 
like you know I could get up and walk it
feels<00:04:51.580> like

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.200 

anyways<00:04:55.060> yeah<00:04:56.020> so<00:04:56.290> we're<00:04:56.440> going<00:04:56.530> to<00:04:56.620> go<00:04:56.740> oh

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
anyways yeah so we're going to go oh

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.310 
anyways yeah so we're going to go oh
yeah<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.330> parts<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.750> Europe<00:04:58.810> they're

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
yeah in parts of Europe they're

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.200 
yeah in parts of Europe they're
considering<00:04:59.710> putting<00:04:59.889> a<00:05:00.010> speed<00:05:00.850> limiter<00:05:01.180> on

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
considering putting a speed limiter on

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.440 
considering putting a speed limiter on
on<00:05:01.540> cars<00:05:02.160> giving<00:05:03.160> them<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> maximum<00:05:03.970> speed<00:05:04.270> of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
on cars giving them a maximum speed of

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.200 
on cars giving them a maximum speed of
seventy<00:05:05.410> miles<00:05:05.740> per<00:05:05.889> hour<00:05:06.190> which<00:05:06.490> is<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.730> 110

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
seventy miles per hour which is like 110

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.270 
seventy miles per hour which is like 110
hundred<00:05:07.510> twenty<00:05:07.780> which<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.230> guess<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.830> England

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
hundred twenty which I guess in England

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.370 
hundred twenty which I guess in England
is<00:05:09.430> probably<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:10.510> fastest<00:05:10.900> speed<00:05:11.110> on<00:05:11.290> the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
is probably the fastest speed on the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.070 
is probably the fastest speed on the
pastures<00:05:11.770> roads<00:05:12.010> speak<00:05:12.730> for<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> speed<00:05:13.810> limit

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
pastures roads speak for the speed limit

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.110 
pastures roads speak for the speed limit
is<00:05:14.169> like<00:05:14.320> 110<00:05:14.650> 120<00:05:15.010> so<00:05:15.639> they're<00:05:15.760> going<00:05:15.850> to<00:05:15.940> just

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
is like 110 120 so they're going to just

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.520 
is like 110 120 so they're going to just
take<00:05:16.300> all<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.600> cars<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.050> put<00:05:17.139> a<00:05:17.169> limiter<00:05:17.500> on

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
take all the cars and put a limiter on

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.320 
take all the cars and put a limiter on
them<00:05:17.740> so<00:05:17.889> they<00:05:17.980> can<00:05:18.010> they<00:05:18.730> physically<00:05:19.150> cannot

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
them so they can they physically cannot

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.200 
them so they can they physically cannot
speed<00:05:19.780> on<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:21.580> quickest<00:05:21.850> throws

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
speed on the quickest throws

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.930 
speed on the quickest throws
which<00:05:23.889> you<00:05:24.889> know<00:05:25.009> kind<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.520> makes<00:05:25.699> sense

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
which you know kind of makes sense

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.330 
which you know kind of makes sense
because<00:05:26.240> if<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.199> fastest<00:05:27.740> road<00:05:28.039> in<00:05:28.220> your

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
because if the fastest road in your

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.570 
because if the fastest road in your
country<00:05:28.850> is<00:05:29.060> like<00:05:29.740> 110<00:05:30.740> kilometers<00:05:31.370> an<00:05:31.490> hour

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
country is like 110 kilometers an hour

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.850 
country is like 110 kilometers an hour
then<00:05:32.210> why<00:05:32.599> would<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.870> need<00:05:33.229> a<00:05:33.289> car<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.770> can

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
then why would you need a car that can

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.370 
then why would you need a car that can
do<00:05:34.039> like<00:05:34.430> 300<00:05:35.090> or<00:05:35.300> 250<00:05:35.599> or<00:05:35.900> something<00:05:36.229> that's

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
do like 300 or 250 or something that's

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.540 
do like 300 or 250 or something that's
like<00:05:36.500> why<00:05:36.650> would<00:05:36.830> you<00:05:37.009> know<00:05:37.130> unless<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.370> can

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
like why would you know unless you can

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.760 
like why would you know unless you can
take<00:05:37.669> it<00:05:37.759> on<00:05:37.819> the<00:05:37.880> racetrack<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.680> then<00:05:39.680> I

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
take it on the racetrack and then I

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.200 
take it on the racetrack and then I
guess<00:05:39.919> for<00:05:40.069> race<00:05:40.250> track<00:05:40.460> usage<00:05:40.699> I<00:05:41.030> guess

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
guess for race track usage I guess

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.460 
guess for race track usage I guess
they'll<00:05:41.360> have<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:41.569> have<00:05:41.840> some<00:05:42.020> kind<00:05:42.050> of<00:05:42.259> like

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
they'll have to have some kind of like

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.140 
they'll have to have some kind of like
the<00:05:42.860> restrictor<00:05:43.430> as<00:05:43.699> you<00:05:43.910> get<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.120> the

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
the restrictor as you get to the
