00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
this old macbook and this is what I've

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129 
this old macbook and this is what I've
been<00:00:14.490> using<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.299> lot<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.509> my<00:00:15.599> video<00:00:15.809> stuff

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
been using for a lot of my video stuff

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.720 
been using for a lot of my video stuff
and<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.130> right<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and as you can see right here like the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.130 
and as you can see right here like the
bottom<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.300> ended<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.570> kind<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.840> melting

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
bottom actually ended up kind of melting

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.590 
bottom actually ended up kind of melting
out<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.859> reason<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.189> was<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
out and the reason for that was that

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.150 
out and the reason for that was that
when<00:00:21.600> i<00:00:21.630> was<00:00:21.930> doing<00:00:22.170> video<00:00:22.590> recording<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
when i was doing video recording and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.340 
when i was doing video recording and
editing<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.210> USB<00:00:24.660> ports<00:00:24.930> right<00:00:25.019> here<00:00:25.080> just

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
editing the USB ports right here just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.599 
editing the USB ports right here just
got<00:00:25.410> super<00:00:25.560> hot<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.070> kind<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> started

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
got super hot and then kind of started

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.040 
got super hot and then kind of started
expanding<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.300> basically<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> computer

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
expanding and basically the computer

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080 
expanding and basically the computer
took<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> big<00:00:28.410> ol<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.949> over<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> last<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
took a big ol so over the last a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.299 
took a big ol so over the last a
little<00:00:30.840> bit<00:00:30.960> been<00:00:31.470> looking<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> couple<00:00:32.189> of

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
little bit been looking at a couple of

editing<00:00:37.559> because<00:00:37.920> i<00:00:38.070> find<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> much<00:00:39.329> easier<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
editing because i find it much easier to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.630 
editing because i find it much easier to
use<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.620> any<00:00:40.710> case<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.520> right

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
use so in any case what we have right

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.959 
use so in any case what we have right
here<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.540> new<00:00:43.230> macbook<00:00:43.590> pro<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
here is a new macbook pro so this is the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.369 
here is a new macbook pro so this is the
bag<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.120> came<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:45.899> here's<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> box

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
bag that came in and then here's the box

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
bag that came in and then here's the box
so<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> lot<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> may<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.789> looking<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.149> this

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so a lot of you may be looking at this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
so a lot of you may be looking at this
and<00:00:48.420> saying<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:49.469> doesn't<00:00:49.710> look<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:49.950> an

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and saying this doesn't look like an

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
and saying this doesn't look like an
Apple<00:00:50.700> box<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.149> absolutely<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.690> so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Apple box and that's absolutely right so

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
Apple box and that's absolutely right so
the<00:00:52.559> reason<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the reason for that is that this is

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.229 
the reason for that is that this is
actually<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.969> refurbished<00:00:54.960> mac<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.149> go

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
actually a refurbished mac so if you go

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.880 
actually a refurbished mac so if you go
out<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> mac<00:00:57.930> website<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> look

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
out to the mac website and then you look

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.310 
out to the mac website and then you look
down<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> bottom<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.600> apple<00:01:01.230> store

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
down to the bottom of the apple store

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
down to the bottom of the apple store
page<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.100> there's<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.550> link<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.210> for

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
page then there's a link down there for

refurbs<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> clearance<00:01:04.890> items<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
refurbs and clearance items so it's

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.590 
refurbs and clearance items so it's
actually<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> really<00:01:05.970> great<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.420> you're
