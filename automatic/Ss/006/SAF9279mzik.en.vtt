sprayed<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.980> coat<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> bubbled<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
sprayed one coat and it bubbled up and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.650 
sprayed one coat and it bubbled up and
ran<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.250> let<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> dry<00:00:30.179> hit<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.539> with

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
ran so I let that dry hit it with

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.240 
ran so I let that dry hit it with
another<00:00:30.900> coat<00:00:31.170> which<00:00:31.410> Believe<00:00:31.980> It<00:00:32.130> or<00:00:32.189> Not

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.209 
another coat which Believe It or Not
bubbled<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.149> ran<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> after<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
bubbled up and ran and then after that

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
bubbled up and ran and then after that
what<00:00:38.219> did<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.790> sprayed<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.329> black

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
what did I do I sprayed it with black

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.130 
what did I do I sprayed it with black
and<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.610> graphite<00:00:42.120> does<00:00:42.420> whatever<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:43.020> want

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and the graphite does whatever you want

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.220 
and the graphite does whatever you want
to<00:00:43.230> call<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.879> terrible<00:00:44.879> paint<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.870> bled

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
to call it the terrible paint just bled

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.630 
to call it the terrible paint just bled
through<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> black<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.510> bubbled<00:00:48.510> up<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.809> ran

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
through the black and bubbled up and ran

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.979 
through the black and bubbled up and ran
but<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:51.000> whatever<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> marble

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

with<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.840> project<00:01:49.320> because<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.860> really

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
with this project because I was really

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.249 
with this project because I was really
bumming<00:01:50.579> about<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.299> paint<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> bubbled

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bumming about that paint how it bubbled

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.999 
bumming about that paint how it bubbled
and<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.680> ran<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:55.560> thought<00:01:55.740> well<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
and how it ran so I just thought well I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.499 
and how it ran so I just thought well I
really<00:01:56.399> had<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> good<00:01:56.729> time<00:01:56.790> while<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> was<00:01:57.360> doing

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
really had a good time while I was doing

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
really had a good time while I was doing
it<00:01:57.689> I'm<00:01:57.840> still<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.320> excited<00:01:58.799> about<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it I'm still really excited about the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.830 
it I'm still really excited about the
body<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.399> wanted<00:01:59.939> us<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.149> auto<00:02:00.420> body<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
