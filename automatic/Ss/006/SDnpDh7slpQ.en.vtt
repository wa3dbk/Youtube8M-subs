00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.850
 Growth and performance can be severely limited 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.990
 conventional place with low ceilings provide ideal conditions to deal with 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.230
 The Florian fly cord perfectly against flying 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.850
 the installation is very easy

 Masonry must be used in advance even cheers so that was in

 Flieden concludes the system for a long time 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.450
 On the long way through the barn, the line is led with hard and rough 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.760
 so that the system can be operated well the cord Intel with the

 enclosed rolls from the wall to be filled the first blanket 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.800
 the bolt in each track age serves to fix the coils 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.950
 and so to ensure the tension of the cord 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 the crank is attached to the junior high school on this is the full

 rolling up the upper side 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.430
 at the first under his ilk system pattern hand the cord through the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 Stable to be led that is not necessary later 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.150
 The enclosed pulleys help with more direction changes the flyers 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.390
 in the plane to move straight 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.560
 Example One shows a simple fly draft guide 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.909
 The gay and full replacement pick are not on the same bracket 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.319
 the open fly cord system 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.879
 Example 2 shows that the cord guide can be done freely in the stable 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.039
 Also a zigzag guiding of the cord is conceivable 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.879
 but beware the forces on guessing roles and fixture will always be 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.719
 greater 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.010
 by the good specially developed Fly duckling the string can on the Lehr

 To tighten the cord, the Fly End replacement spool is locked with the split 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.520
 then the cord is stretched with the empty Spuhler appropriately 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.219
 and also locked with the bolt 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:46.119
 So the flyer in the fly string is ready for the number of flies in the stable 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:48.059
 to reduce patiently 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.059

 Fly high end fly management systems all the mounting material is there 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.749
 so that nothing stands in the way of the installation, they are now active 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.349
 the spring launch is the best time the non-toxic systems can fly 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.229
 to bring back to fruition 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.989
