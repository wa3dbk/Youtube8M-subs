 Photoshop video tutorials 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.030
 Hello dear friends in touch 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.280
 Kuzmichev Alexey and in this small 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.260
 video tutorial I'll show you a few 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.350
 ways to add a vignette 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.300
 to your picture very often vignette 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.570
 helps to emphasize well some 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.950
 the object in the photo using the fact that 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.010
 we shade 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.070
 we need the area and we need an object 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.420
 as it stands out on this plan 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.790
 so let's take a few 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.610
 ways that can help you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.690
 do the first and easiest way 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.600
 it create a new empty layer on top 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:57.129
 our photos choose on the palette 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 black fill this layer with black 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.460
 color press the combination of al cases and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.950
 now add a mask to this layer 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.130
 click here and with the help 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.700
 black to white gradient style 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.369
 put a radial fill for it 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.549
 like this from center to edge 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.070
 our gradient layer as a result of us 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.440
 it turns out such a vignette here if 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:31.860
 it is not even and you can correct it again 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:35.450
 just worked gradients that's about 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.789
 so if everyone 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.409
 that photo got too dark 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.009
 you can lower at any time 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:47.420
 the transparency of this layer to the one we need 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.270
 as you can see the water and here it is after the first 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.229
 the way the second way is to create 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.850
 adjustment layer curves bend 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.140
 curve about like this 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:08.360
 down about so that the whole picture 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 we got a little dark and also pour 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 this gradient layer is also from center to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.440
 edges around like this and as you can see 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.049
 we also get a vignette only 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.260
 blames to in this case looks more 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.810
 naturally and does not disturb the contrast throughout 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.970
 photos, in this case, we have 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.420
 a little lost contrast when we 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.450
 just put a black layer on top here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.569
 this way it allows us to dim 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.030
 our photo is more realistic and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.540
 us as you can see the contrast is not lost 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.889
 very important so well and the last way 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 which also has a place to be this 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.769
 adding a vignette with a filter 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.079
 distortion correction 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.880
 in order to take advantage of us with 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.790
 you need to duplicate our 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.489
 background layer press control 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.209
 jay on the keyboard and go to paragraph 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.000
 filter 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.000
 here we choose distortion correction 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.790
 here we go to the tab 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.549
 customized 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.620
 and in this tab we have 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.630
 such is the vignette section here 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.049
 two sliders this slider 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.000
 effect and average . dragging the slider 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.720
 the effect we can dim you 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.760
 image as you can see the stronger I am 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.190
 drag the stronger we go for 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 darker if we drag accordingly 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.220
 in the right side of this slider with us 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.079
 it will be the other way around, for example 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 but so here I think you can leave 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.299
 and the creeper is our midpoint 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.490
 responsible for the radius of this very 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.320
 blackout that is what 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.870
 stronger we drag it left 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.000
 more we darken ours 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.910
 image that is , the greater the radius 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.500
 blackouts if we drag to the right then 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.020
 accordingly, it is also less selected 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.230
 here depending on your needs and and 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.560
 your photo look at this effect 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.770
 on the result when everything suits us 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.600
 just click ok 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.500
 in the end we get this result 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.390
 as you can see the house and after the Well 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.820
 these three easy ways will help you 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.960
 quickly and easily add a vignette to 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.510
 any of your shot 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 which of these methods to use already 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.240
 you decide I hope this video lesson you 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.180
 It will be useful to all, thank you for your attention and
