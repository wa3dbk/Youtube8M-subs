I<00:02:04.619> did<00:02:05.159> some<00:02:05.369> research<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.329> read<00:02:06.689> lots

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I did some research on it and read lots

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.160 
I did some research on it and read lots
of<00:02:07.819> comments

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
of comments

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.740 
of comments
and<00:02:09.259> stuff<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:09.740> that<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:11.120> didn't<00:02:11.540> find

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
and stuff like that and I didn't find

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.870 
and stuff like that and I didn't find
anything<00:02:12.260> negative<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> thought<00:02:13.580> okay

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
anything negative so I thought okay

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.100 
anything negative so I thought okay
let's<00:02:13.910> give<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.599> shot

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
let's give it a shot

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.809 
let's give it a shot
you<00:02:15.290> can't<00:02:15.590> do<00:02:15.770> anything<00:02:16.040> wrong<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.430> that

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
you can't do anything wrong for that

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.870 
you can't do anything wrong for that
price<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.750> course<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.260> can't<00:02:18.560> really<00:02:19.400> expect

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
price of course you can't really expect

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.520 
price of course you can't really expect
the<00:02:20.390> best<00:02:20.950> quality<00:02:21.950> at<00:02:22.340> all<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> AFC<00:02:24.319> is

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the best quality at all like the AFC is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.979 
the best quality at all like the AFC is
super<00:02:24.950> slow<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.880> just<00:02:26.090> never<00:02:26.239> focuses<00:02:26.810> on

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
super slow and it just never focuses on

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.229 
super slow and it just never focuses on
what<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.319> are<00:02:27.470> like<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.400> can't<00:02:28.700> use<00:02:28.970> this

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
what you are like you can't use this

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.990 
what you are like you can't use this
lens<00:02:29.510> with<00:02:29.930> air<00:02:30.170> which<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.709> impossible<00:02:31.010> but

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
lens with air which is impossible but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.850 
lens with air which is impossible but
for<00:02:32.209> me<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.810> disadvantage<00:02:33.200> because

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
for me that's not a disadvantage because

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.080 
for me that's not a disadvantage because
I<00:02:34.190> never<00:02:34.250> photographing<00:02:35.090> with<00:02:35.239> AF<00:02:35.600> anyway<00:02:36.050> so

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
I never photographing with AF anyway so

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.430 
I never photographing with AF anyway so
that<00:02:38.090> doesn't<00:02:38.300> even<00:02:38.540> matter<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:39.019> me<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
that doesn't even matter for me if the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.340 
that doesn't even matter for me if the
AF<00:02:39.769> works<00:02:40.040> I'm<00:02:40.310> not<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.569> people<00:02:41.780> who

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
AF works I'm not but for people who

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.280 
AF works I'm not but for people who
maybe<00:02:42.739> are<00:02:43.040> used<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.580> AF<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.239> who<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.989> shoot

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
maybe are used to AF and who just shoot

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.590 
maybe are used to AF and who just shoot
an<00:02:45.500> AF<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.100> are<00:02:46.430> not<00:02:46.670> very<00:02:46.700> familiar<00:02:47.239> with

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
an AF and are not very familiar with

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.830 
an AF and are not very familiar with
many<00:02:48.440> Oh<00:02:48.590> focus<00:02:49.100> then<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:50.060> lens<00:02:50.299> probably

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
many Oh focus then this lens probably

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
many Oh focus then this lens probably
won't<00:02:51.080> work<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.890> all<00:02:52.100> I<00:02:52.370> made<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
won't work for you at all I made the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.600 
won't work for you at all I made the
experience<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.720> on<00:02:53.930> my<00:02:54.110> 5d<00:02:54.799> Mark<00:02:55.010> 3<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.430> is

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
experience that on my 5d Mark 3 it is

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.910 
experience that on my 5d Mark 3 it is
indeed<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.390> bit<00:02:56.660> better<00:02:56.930> maybe<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.739> also

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
indeed a bit better maybe it also

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.640 
indeed a bit better maybe it also
depends<00:02:58.519> from<00:02:58.700> camera<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.150> camera<00:02:59.380> but<00:03:00.380> on<00:03:00.410> my

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
depends from camera to camera but on my

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.449 
depends from camera to camera but on my
5d<00:03:01.069> I<00:03:01.340> took<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.030> few<00:03:02.540> ice<00:03:03.440> shots<00:03:03.830> were<00:03:04.069> they<00:03:04.190> it

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
5d I took a few ice shots were they it

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.420 
5d I took a few ice shots were they it
really<00:03:04.790> focused<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.450> what<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.600> want<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.860> it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
really focused on what I want so and it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.910 
really focused on what I want so and it
was<00:03:07.610> also<00:03:07.819> quite<00:03:08.120> fast<00:03:08.410> maybe<00:03:09.410> it's<00:03:09.739> really

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
was also quite fast maybe it's really

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.059 
was also quite fast maybe it's really
different<00:03:10.790> depending<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.930> your<00:03:12.080> camera<00:03:12.290> but

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
different depending on your camera but

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.259 
different depending on your camera but
if<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.400> want<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.670> get<00:03:13.820> into<00:03:14.000> maker

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
if you want to get into maker

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.509 
if you want to get into maker
photography<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.410> men<00:03:15.680> your<00:03:15.829> focus<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.340> no

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
photography and men your focus is no

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.759 
photography and men your focus is no
problem<00:03:16.910> for<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.269> then<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.900> definitely<00:03:18.380> is

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
problem for you then this definitely is

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.560 
problem for you then this definitely is
the<00:03:18.799> lens<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.459> go<00:03:19.579> because<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.269> really<00:03:20.600> cheap

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the lens to go because it's really cheap

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.099

lens right here in this display so

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.979 
lens right here in this display so
although<00:03:58.549> you're<00:03:59.090> really<00:03:59.450> close<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.780> your

eye you can still kind of see a bit

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.289

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
on the back of the camera I'm usually

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.170 
on the back of the camera I'm usually
sitting<00:06:26.409> in<00:06:26.740> front<00:06:26.860> of<00:06:27.039> my<00:06:27.159> camera<00:06:27.370> focusing

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
sitting in front of my camera focusing

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.570 
sitting in front of my camera focusing
on<00:06:28.389> what<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:28.569> want<00:06:28.899> and<00:06:29.199> then<00:06:29.680> I<00:06:29.800> look<00:06:30.009> what<00:06:30.399> the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
on what I want and then I look what the

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.299 
on what I want and then I look what the
other<00:06:30.789> I<00:06:31.029> passed<00:06:31.479> the<00:06:31.719> camera<00:06:32.080> in<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:33.099> mirror

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:33.309 
other I passed the camera in the mirror

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:35.759 
other I passed the camera in the mirror
and<00:06:33.580> I<00:06:33.789> can<00:06:34.059> see<00:06:34.509> in<00:06:34.779> the<00:06:35.019> mirror<00:06:35.139> what<00:06:35.559> I'm

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:35.769 
and I can see in the mirror what I'm

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:38.189 
and I can see in the mirror what I'm
focusing<00:06:36.309> on<00:06:36.459> what<00:06:36.519> I'm<00:06:36.849> not<00:06:37.059> focusing<00:06:37.569> on<00:06:37.719> so

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
focusing on what I'm not focusing on so

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.499 
focusing on what I'm not focusing on so
that<00:06:38.409> is<00:06:38.559> really<00:06:38.919> useful<00:06:39.699> and<00:06:39.819> helpful<00:06:40.149> so

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:40.509 
that is really useful and helpful so

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.199 
that is really useful and helpful so
that<00:06:41.080> mirror<00:06:41.289> kinda<00:06:41.800> replaces<00:06:42.399> the<00:06:42.639> 60d

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.209 
that mirror kinda replaces the 60d

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:45.749 
that mirror kinda replaces the 60d
feature<00:06:43.419> of<00:06:44.139> course<00:06:44.409> it's<00:06:44.800> not<00:06:45.009> the<00:06:45.189> same<00:06:45.430> as

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
feature of course it's not the same as

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.389 
feature of course it's not the same as
an<00:06:45.909> LCD<00:06:46.389> display<00:06:46.509> which<00:06:47.169> was<00:06:47.409> a<00:06:47.589> lot<00:06:48.370> more

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:48.399 
an LCD display which was a lot more

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.839 
an LCD display which was a lot more
easier<00:06:49.180> to<00:06:49.209> handle<00:06:49.870> actually<00:06:50.159> but<00:06:51.159> it<00:06:51.490> just

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
easier to handle actually but it just

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.179 
easier to handle actually but it just
makes<00:06:52.389> you<00:06:52.539> like<00:06:52.719> a<00:06:52.749> lot<00:06:53.080> easier<00:06:53.559> when<00:06:53.979> you

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.189 
makes you like a lot easier when you

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:57.629 
makes you like a lot easier when you
don't<00:06:54.399> have<00:06:54.669> that<00:06:54.909> future<00:06:55.719> and<00:06:56.259> here<00:06:57.219> you<00:06:57.459> can

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
don't have that future and here you can

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.909 
don't have that future and here you can
see<00:06:57.819> a<00:06:57.849> very<00:06:58.089> short<00:06:58.509> clip<00:06:58.689> of<00:06:58.839> how<00:06:59.169> I<00:06:59.199> take

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
see a very short clip of how I take

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:02.459 
see a very short clip of how I take
photos<00:07:00.339> with<00:07:00.550> my<00:07:00.759> 5d<00:07:01.209> Mark<00:07:01.479> 3<00:07:01.539> as<00:07:01.930> I<00:07:02.199> said

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:02.469 
photos with my 5d Mark 3 as I said

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.769 
photos with my 5d Mark 3 as I said
before<00:07:02.649> I<00:07:03.129> have<00:07:03.339> a<00:07:03.370> mirror<00:07:03.669> unlike<00:07:04.180> you<00:07:04.360> to<00:07:04.509> the

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:04.779 
before I have a mirror unlike you to the

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:06.600 
before I have a mirror unlike you to the
camera<00:07:05.110> in<00:07:05.199> front<00:07:05.319> of<00:07:05.529> it<00:07:05.680> and<00:07:05.889> I'm<00:07:06.580> just

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
camera in front of it and I'm just

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.209 
camera in front of it and I'm just
mental<00:07:07.149> manually<00:07:07.809> focusing<00:07:08.349> on<00:07:08.529> my<00:07:08.740> eye<00:07:08.769> by

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:09.219 
mental manually focusing on my eye by

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:11.219 
mental manually focusing on my eye by
looking<00:07:09.639> in<00:07:09.819> the<00:07:09.999> mirror<00:07:10.240> and<00:07:10.449> seeing<00:07:10.779> what<00:07:11.079> is

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:11.229 
looking in the mirror and seeing what is

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.199 
looking in the mirror and seeing what is
in<00:07:11.349> focus<00:07:11.499> and<00:07:11.889> what<00:07:12.039> not<00:07:12.249> so<00:07:12.459> this<00:07:13.029> really

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.209 
in focus and what not so this really

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:15.149 
in focus and what not so this really
needs<00:07:13.569> some<00:07:13.719> practice<00:07:13.870> and<00:07:14.319> it<00:07:14.589> probably

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
needs some practice and it probably

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:16.650 
needs some practice and it probably
won't<00:07:15.459> work<00:07:15.550> out<00:07:15.879> the<00:07:16.089> first

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
won't work out the first

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.080 
won't work out the first
but<00:07:17.320> I<00:07:17.560> hope<00:07:17.800> these<00:07:18.040> tips<00:07:18.310> helped<00:07:18.700> you<00:07:18.760> somehow
