backs that's a bit disappointing thought

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.619 
backs that's a bit disappointing thought
maybe<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:38.879> surely<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.390> come

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
maybe because surely would have come

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270

having<00:02:47.060> chances<00:02:47.329> we<00:02:47.720> were<00:02:47.870> generating<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.500> few

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650

was<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.359> those<00:03:11.660> frustrating<00:03:12.200> chances<00:03:12.650> that

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
was just those frustrating chances that

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740

we<00:03:12.889> had<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.250> didn't<00:03:13.549> take<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.030> again

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
we had that we didn't take and again

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
chances at Cazalla shot again that would

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.240 
chances at Cazalla shot again that would
have<00:03:19.489> put<00:03:19.579> us<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.940> nil<00:03:20.120> up<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.540> he<00:03:20.630> saved<00:03:20.930> and

have put us to nil up that he saved and
he<00:03:22.250> just<00:03:22.459> kept<00:03:22.639> him<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:22.880> game<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.419> it<00:03:23.840> was

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
he just kept him in the game and it was

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.270 
he just kept him in the game and it was
really<00:03:24.230> frustrating<00:03:24.440> cuz<00:03:24.829> we<00:03:24.950> could<00:03:25.099> have<00:03:25.190> had

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
really frustrating cuz we could have had

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.860 
really frustrating cuz we could have had
a<00:03:25.310> decent<00:03:25.549> win<00:03:25.910> that's<00:03:26.359> not<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.660> say<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
a decent win that's not to say the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
a decent win that's not to say the
Cooper<00:03:27.290> yard<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.680> generate<00:03:28.069> any<00:03:28.280> good

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
Cooper yard and generate any good

Cooper yard and generate any good
chances<00:03:28.970> there<00:03:29.389> was<00:03:29.540> one<00:03:29.750> chance<00:03:30.340> where<00:03:31.340> one

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
chances there was one chance where one

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.339 
chances there was one chance where one
of<00:03:31.639> their<00:03:31.849> players<00:03:31.970> just<00:03:32.389> took<00:03:32.840> our<00:03:33.019> defense

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
of their players just took our defense

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.659 
of their players just took our defense
on<00:03:33.560> go<00:03:34.040> through<00:03:34.489> them<00:03:34.700> somehow<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.519> up

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
on go through them somehow and it was up

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.789 
on go through them somehow and it was up
to<00:03:37.849> monona<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.660> block<00:03:39.139> him<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.500> run<00:03:39.680> into

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
to monona to just block him and run into

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.140 
to monona to just block him and run into
him<00:03:39.980> basically<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.579> that's<00:03:40.700> what<00:03:40.849> he<00:03:40.910> did<00:03:40.940> and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
him basically and that's what he did and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.370 
him basically and that's what he did and
he<00:03:41.239> saved<00:03:41.569> us<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.019> was<00:03:42.109> when<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:42.349> had

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
he saved us and that was when they had

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.670 
he saved us and that was when they had
10<00:03:42.739> men<00:03:42.919> after<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.459> bewa<00:03:43.970> got<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> red<00:03:45.169> card<00:03:45.200> I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
10 men after and bewa got a red card I

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.229 
10 men after and bewa got a red card I
think<00:03:45.919> it's<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.130> pronounced<00:03:46.459> his<00:03:46.609> name<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:47.000> be

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
think it's a pronounced his name and be

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.539 
think it's a pronounced his name and be
what<00:03:47.450> got<00:03:48.139> a<00:03:48.169> red<00:03:48.380> card<00:03:48.410> after<00:03:48.769> he<00:03:49.040> kicked<00:03:49.370> them

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
what got a red card after he kicked them

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.520 
what got a red card after he kicked them
on<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:50.090> think<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.450> was<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.630> kicker<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.959> don't

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
on I think it was a kicker I don't

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.379 
on I think it was a kicker I don't
really<00:03:51.799> know<00:03:51.919> what<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.190> exactly<00:03:52.639> wasn't<00:03:53.239> just

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
really know what it exactly wasn't just

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.490 
really know what it exactly wasn't just
look<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.660> he<00:03:53.780> kicked<00:03:54.019> him<00:03:54.169> while<00:03:54.319> I<00:03:54.349> was<00:03:54.470> on

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
look like he kicked him while I was on

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.039 
look like he kicked him while I was on
the<00:03:54.620> ground<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:56.090> was<00:03:56.209> after<00:03:56.359> he<00:03:56.750> had

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
the ground and that was after he had

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.199 
the ground and that was after he had
received<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.560> free<00:03:57.739> kick<00:03:57.950> from<00:03:58.340> Vermeil<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:58.849> so

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
received a free kick from Vermeil and so

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.509 
received a free kick from Vermeil and so
it<00:03:59.269> was<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.569> stupid<00:04:00.079> red<00:04:00.410> card<00:04:00.709> definitely

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
it was a stupid red card definitely

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.159 
it was a stupid red card definitely
changed<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:01.970> game<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.150> little<00:04:02.389> bit<00:04:02.510> put<00:04:02.930> us<00:04:03.019> in

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
changed the game a little bit put us in

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.170 
changed the game a little bit put us in
control<00:04:03.500> obviously<00:04:03.650> but<00:04:04.519> even<00:04:04.760> then<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:04.940> was

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
control obviously but even then I was

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.150 
control obviously but even then I was
disappointed<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.840> even<00:04:06.620> though<00:04:06.799> we<00:04:07.010> had

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
disappointed that even though we had

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.550 
disappointed that even though we had
more<00:04:07.340> me<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.730> pitch<00:04:07.879> we<00:04:08.750> didn't<00:04:09.049> seem<00:04:09.319> to

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
more me on the pitch we didn't seem to

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.619 
more me on the pitch we didn't seem to
put<00:04:09.829> our<00:04:09.919> dominance<00:04:10.459> on<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.700> as<00:04:10.879> much<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.180> we

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
put our dominance on it as much as we

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.930 
put our dominance on it as much as we
could<00:04:12.049> have<00:04:12.109> they<00:04:12.889> generated<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.669> as<00:04:13.790> many

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
could have they generated just as many

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.610 
could have they generated just as many
chances<00:04:14.209> when<00:04:14.780> they<00:04:14.870> had<00:04:14.989> 10<00:04:15.169> matters<00:04:15.470> when

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
chances when they had 10 matters when

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.949 
chances when they had 10 matters when
they<00:04:15.739> had<00:04:15.859> 11<00:04:16.100> so<00:04:16.489> that's<00:04:17.239> not

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
they had 11 so that's not

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.659 
they had 11 so that's not
you<00:04:18.079> want<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.680> side<00:04:19.039> of<00:04:19.069> the<00:04:19.190> game<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.459> didn't

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
you want that side of the game I didn't

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.629 
you want that side of the game I didn't
like<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.600> like<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.500> we<00:04:21.650> generated<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.430> few

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
like but I like that we generated a few

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.129 
like but I like that we generated a few
more<00:04:22.729> chances<00:04:23.000> we<00:04:23.330> considered<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.840> few<00:04:23.990> more

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
more chances we considered a few more

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.710 
more chances we considered a few more
but<00:04:24.650> we<00:04:25.130> actually<00:04:25.280> made<00:04:25.789> chances<00:04:26.300> with<00:04:26.479> in<00:04:26.599> the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
but we actually made chances with in the

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.629 
but we actually made chances with in the
last<00:04:26.750> two<00:04:27.110> games<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.740> we<00:04:27.949> did<00:04:28.069> was<00:04:28.130> pass<00:04:28.400> it

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
last two games all we did was pass it

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.270 
last two games all we did was pass it
around<00:04:28.729> maybe<00:04:29.360> here<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.110> there<00:04:30.289> you<00:04:30.979> know<00:04:31.130> we

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
around maybe here and there you know we

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.640 
around maybe here and there you know we
would<00:04:31.460> generate<00:04:31.849> a<00:04:32.060> half-chance<00:04:32.660> lift<00:04:33.530> this

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
would generate a half-chance lift this

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.189 
would generate a half-chance lift this
time<00:04:33.889> we've<00:04:34.130> got<00:04:34.310> space<00:04:34.910> Santos<00:04:35.750> was<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:35.990> bit

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
time we've got space Santos was a bit

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.159 
time we've got space Santos was a bit
better<00:04:36.319> I<00:04:36.590> mean<00:04:37.240> when<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.270> say<00:04:38.509> that<00:04:38.750> doesn't

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
better I mean when I say that doesn't

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.390 
better I mean when I say that doesn't
mean<00:04:39.259> that<00:04:39.349> he<00:04:39.470> had<00:04:39.560> outstanding<00:04:39.919> game<00:04:40.250> it

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
mean that he had outstanding game it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.460 
mean that he had outstanding game it
just<00:04:40.430> means<00:04:40.699> he<00:04:40.849> was<00:04:40.970> less<00:04:41.810> how<00:04:42.289> many

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
just means he was less how many
