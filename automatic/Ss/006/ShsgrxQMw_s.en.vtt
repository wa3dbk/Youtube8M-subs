it doesn't have to be super straight but

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.289 
it doesn't have to be super straight but
try<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.110> get<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.590> even<00:01:57.799> as<00:01:58.310> possible<00:02:01.299> next

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
try to get it as even as possible next

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.480 
try to get it as even as possible next
I'll<00:02:02.570> fold<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.960> material<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.680> two<00:02:03.920> corners

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
I'll fold the material in two corners

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.590 
I'll fold the material in two corners
and<00:02:05.289> begin<00:02:06.289> taking<00:02:06.799> my<00:02:06.979> tailors<00:02:07.490> chalk<00:02:07.600> making

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
and begin taking my tailors chalk making

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.590 
and begin taking my tailors chalk making
three<00:02:09.020> even<00:02:09.800> marks<00:02:10.220> about<00:02:10.640> an<00:02:11.090> inch<00:02:11.360> or<00:02:11.569> so

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
three even marks about an inch or so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.220 
three even marks about an inch or so
apart<00:02:12.260> from<00:02:12.410> each<00:02:12.650> other<00:02:13.690> then<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:15.050> cut

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
apart from each other then I will cut

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.949 
apart from each other then I will cut
along<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.709> first<00:02:16.040> marking<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> made<00:02:17.780> on

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
along the first marking that I made on

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.259 
along the first marking that I made on
the<00:02:18.080> fabric<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.769> then<00:02:19.400> continue<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:19.970> same

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
the fabric and then continue the same

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.390 
the fabric and then continue the same
process<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.110> other<00:02:21.140> two<00:02:21.530> markings<00:02:21.950> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
process on the other two markings to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.229 
process on the other two markings to
create<00:02:22.730> three<00:02:23.030> equal<00:02:23.600> strips<00:02:25.030> when<00:02:26.030> three

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
create three equal strips when three

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.120 
create three equal strips when three
strips<00:02:26.540> are<00:02:26.690> actually<00:02:27.049> done<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.530> will<00:02:27.830> hold

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
strips are actually done I will hold

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.120 
strips are actually done I will hold
them<00:02:28.310> side-by-side<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.420> cut<00:02:29.930> them<00:02:30.170> along<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
them side-by-side and cut them along the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.460 
them side-by-side and cut them along the
middle<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:32.060> gives<00:02:32.360> me<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.600> total<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.080> six

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
middle this gives me a total of six

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.420 
middle this gives me a total of six
equal<00:02:34.010> pieces<00:02:35.380> next<00:02:36.380> we<00:02:36.650> move<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.280> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
equal pieces next we move on to the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.410 
equal pieces next we move on to the
sleeve<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.269> get<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.709> pretty<00:02:39.709> even<00:02:40.420> semicircle
