who<00:00:58.809> succeed<00:00:59.260> are<00:00:59.469> students<00:01:00.070> who<00:01:00.250> aren't

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
who succeed are students who aren't

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.759 
who succeed are students who aren't
there<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.119> taught<00:01:01.359> their<00:01:02.170> students<00:01:02.680> who

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
are there to learn and have an

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.350 
are there to learn and have an
obligation<00:01:05.350> as<00:01:06.039> part<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.340> learning<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:07.240> be

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
obligation as part of learning to be

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.090 
obligation as part of learning to be
able<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> contribute<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.289> help<00:01:08.320> others<00:01:09.070> learn

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
able to contribute and help others learn

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.419 
able to contribute and help others learn
as<00:01:09.640> someone<00:01:09.939> who<00:01:10.000> has<00:01:10.030> direction<00:01:10.979> which<00:01:11.979> which

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
as someone who has direction which which

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.840 
as someone who has direction which which
is<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.850> guess<00:01:13.270> somewhat<00:01:14.170> indicative<00:01:14.619> of<00:01:14.890> adult

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
is I guess somewhat indicative of adult

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.450 
is I guess somewhat indicative of adult
education<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.350> people<00:01:17.649> do<00:01:17.830> tend<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.280> have

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
education is that people do tend to have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.570 
education is that people do tend to have
more<00:01:18.729> direction<00:01:19.210> but<00:01:19.330> even<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.590> students

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
more direction but even the the students

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.740 
more direction but even the the students
who<00:01:21.670> really<00:01:21.759> fresh<00:01:22.060> out<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.240> high<00:01:22.360> school<00:01:22.479> I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
who really fresh out of high school I

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.359 
who really fresh out of high school I
found<00:01:23.110> we're<00:01:23.319> just<00:01:23.470> really<00:01:23.649> determined<00:01:24.250> like

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
found we're just really determined like

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.680 
found we're just really determined like
they<00:01:24.490> knew<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:24.970> what<00:01:25.090> they<00:01:25.209> wanted<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.539> do
