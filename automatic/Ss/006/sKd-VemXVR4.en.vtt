00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.500
 can take a coin 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.850
 it happens all because you're hiding 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.950
 feel easy 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.320
 this is a fact that is chasing me 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.640
 you do not know one and I crossed it and suddenly 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 made me solid 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 and its strap and fast 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 and followed very closely if he was out there 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.600
 was coming Munich you see 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.600
 you look 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:01.070
 Look how good he found this place 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.690
 because although that beast is a number 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.290
 very big or the birds like here to see 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.940
 how well and how does he feel he put them 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.500
 I could not, I'm not afraid 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.720
 mones with a let me hide 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.460
 aitor the truth that it will not be that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.660
 something else was happening to the kitten 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.660
 better that's why he made you like that 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.830
 all I know is that the wolf will 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.130
 know why they get the back of the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 cats 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 the truth that I have no idea and you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.220
 friends also because cats bow 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.640
 so the tenderloin 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.230
 because the dog fights because he 's 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.800
 angry because they do not want dogs 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.240
 I grab it because they stay do not get 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.150
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.230
 for a furious because there is no fish 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.320
 because it 's up to the food because he thinks 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:00.830
 who wants to bite her because she gets angry 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.260
 to scare the kids so that 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.630
 leave because a person bothers us 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.380
 because they take out the food 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.520
 because the fingers of the lions go for 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.580
 cadiz although someone is 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.959
 doing the thing that do not drink things 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.610
 interesting things that our 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.610
 friends but take methods 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.690
 and please what are you going to see if you realize 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.460
 that we are here hidden I can not 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.700
 believe you do not know the terror that gives me that 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.820
 good cat takes the best since he left a lot 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 more nothing is to say that he left because it is 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.510
 very difficult to try to forget the face 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.310
 I had this cat because I had some 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 teeth like that the little hands with the little arms 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.510
 well I had too much 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.660
 good because we look at the great 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.250
 encyclopedia the world that according to tells us 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 because it was the loin the cats is right 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.910
 I have 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.140
 because it says when a cat feels that what 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.740
 they will attack then it gets bigger 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.680
 stretch or lose their legs like this is done 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.870
 higher inflates your entire back as if 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.870
 it was a ball and it makes a noise like 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.490
 that that same thing made me metopa let's continue 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.270
 looking like the cat does this 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.069
 to look great I'm a huge beast 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.980
 in clouds I am tall and giant 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.139
 a little short and small because 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.840
 then looks became large butt 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.590
 notice that cats when they are afraid 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.329
 they defend themselves and become big 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.079
 huge as you found yourself 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.599
 but then he was afraid of me 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.939
 poor thing he thought I was going to attack him 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.359
 stretch the legs bend down inflate the 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:56.090
 back make noises everything depends if 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.790
 they feel afraid or if they are angry or 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.280
 then they were right chocolate and kitten 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.099
 I was also scared and so ends 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.049
 back in a great idea that your 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.849
 awesome on top of very good 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.150
 actors have a great memory the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.150
 cats 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.410
 and all 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:24.060
 incredible is almost impossible not to see who 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.980

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.890

 cristian wide at a time so big 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.310
 of the body 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:40.760
 listen to say who I have prepared 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.140
 because I do not want to grab I want to look at it 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.840
 in the eyes and make them understand well 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.670
 then no no you should not be afraid with 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.500
 this body that does not take but you're not going to 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.180
 scare the poor cat 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.260
 He is going to scare you in fear 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.930
