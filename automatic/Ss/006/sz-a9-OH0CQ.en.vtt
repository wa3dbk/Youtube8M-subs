it for the you know drop arrow drop act

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.070 
it for the you know drop arrow drop act
like<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:09.210> 0<00:01:09.600> 20<00:01:10.020> yards<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> dot<00:01:11.010> at

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
like at 0 20 yards and you got a dot at

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.070 
like at 0 20 yards and you got a dot at
30<00:01:13.080> 40<00:01:13.710> 50<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:15.119> recommend<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> hunt

30 40 50 and they recommend not to hunt
past<00:01:19.220> 40<00:01:20.220> yards<00:01:22.400> main<00:01:23.400> reason<00:01:23.820> being<00:01:23.939> i<00:01:24.210> guess

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
past 40 yards main reason being i guess

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.609 
past 40 yards main reason being i guess
is<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.150> get<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:27.840> wind<00:01:28.229> gust<00:01:28.470> or

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is if you get a you know wind gust or

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
is if you get a you know wind gust or
whatever<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> becomes<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> air<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.210> know

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
whatever it becomes the air you know

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
whatever it becomes the air you know
it's<00:01:30.509> hard<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.840> consistent<00:01:31.770> i'm<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.159> 40

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it's hard to get consistent i'm at 40

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's hard to get consistent i'm at 40
yards<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> we'll<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> what

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
yards right now so we'll see what
