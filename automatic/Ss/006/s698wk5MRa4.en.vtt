00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 on russia that point fr we want to 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.220
 make you bloom your plants and 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.299
 especially all those faded flowers that 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.790
 only ask one thing is to be 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.790
 cut to bounce in bloom 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.750
 let's start with plants and more 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 unpleasant to the touch the petunias the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.700
 surfinias because they have the disadvantage 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.080
 when touched them very sticky the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.340
 morning they are less so when they are 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.590
 so wet so as not to wet his 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.630
 hands if we remove his flowers is that 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.849
 the faded flowers is that they are at 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.349
 detriment of new flowers they go 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.820
 often could cause the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.130
 rotten and this is a bit the case here 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.780
 so why are these flowers strong hills and 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.670
 that they are not fertilized 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 there are no seeds that form 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.780
 because they are hybrids so we're going 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.630
 remove them and for that I'm using a 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.720
 scissors and it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.610
 remove all the flowers the flowers 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.480
 damaged we can even when you do 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.240
 a great cleaning 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.790
 it can be after a weekend by 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.640
 example or a weekend or vacation 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.770
 really intersect the stems of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.170
 way what they leave from lower 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.290
 so do not hesitate to cut off any 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.420
 way the petunias the surfinias 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.220
 will bloom very quickly if for example we 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.259
 left his flowers on even 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.899
 flourish on this rod its going him 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.909
 allow to bend a little bit but 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.399
 we see a quantity of buttons and 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.499
 flowers that are ready to go 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.299
 but on one condition it's 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.829
 cut off the head and at that moment we are going 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.749
 to have a new generation of flowers 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.590
 and buttons that will flourish on 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.600
 this same rod 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.609
 it also helps when removing 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 faded flowers of a plant from him 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.420
 give a little pep it is 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.639
 to say that they are less tired then 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.429
 following this for example regarding this 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.499
 petunias planter dual I will 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.240
 pink is a good shot give him 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.749
 the fertilizer is normally by a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.310
 week 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:50.469
 she should continue to bloom it's 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.119
 a rule also concerning plants 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.259
 that you have in your planters if 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.029
 you want it to be very pretty in 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.709
 a week or two weeks 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.389
 especially do not let the flowers 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.619
 cut off all the flowers concerning the 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.240
 geraniums yesterday is much more 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.679
 easy to clean a cleaning that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.349
 is not really genuinely 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.119
 obligatory we notice on the stems 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.500
 and the rods that are fans and they 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.179
 disappear themselves but it is 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 better to have more 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 flowers just look at them 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.040
 planters in Alsace they are 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.440
 always very flowery and you will see that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.629
 Alsatians and Alsatians withdraw 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 permanently faded flowers then 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.280
 when we remove the faded flowers 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.970
 they are removed to the east 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.709
 very quickly and enjoy when you 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 do a cleaning of flowers when 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 you remove your faded flowers from 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.840
 also remove the flowers that are 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.819
 flourished it's useless to let them 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.590
 they will soon be replaced by others 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.290
 buttons will not happen three days 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.480
 without having new flowers the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
 zonal geraniums zonal geraniums this 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.120
 are geraniums whose flowers are 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.520
 bigger 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 here is a gift class aa geraniums 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.060
 white ronald then they have the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.310
 particularity if you leave the flower 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.920
 there is a rottenness that settles on 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.870
 the flower no we see it well and that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.400
 rotten the stem and it's not very 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.790
 nice it's not very pretty either 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.160
 so the goal is to withdraw as and when 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.800
 measure the faded flowers and there we see 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.730
 that the buttons have blossomed 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.380
 to the end always by removing the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.480
 stem up to the base 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.330
 know that a flower is much more 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.360
 easy to remove when it was good 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.910
 moisten a dry flower before 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.489
 is much harder to remove 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.140
 so here is where we have three buttons and 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.060
 this plant will continue to bloom 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.650
 always in the same style the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.410
 geraniums then there are geraniums 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.030
 with simple flowers of the zonal who have the 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.760
 peculiarity of having flowers too 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.880
 self cleaning but it does not prevent it 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.030
 is always better to remove 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.860
 flowers of other flowers sometimes are 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.340
 difficult to know if they are faded 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.160
 or not it is the case of the hibiscus 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.230
 hibiscus or rose have the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.560
 peculiarity of having an ephemeral flower 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.799
 to spot if your flower is a fan and 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.260
 just observe the pistil if the 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:11.700
 pistil comes out of the button it's a flower 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.220
 faded you remove it here and there we 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.250
 have a button without track it so we 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.720
 leave them because they will bloom from here 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.150
 a day since it is a very flower 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.190
 ephemeral take the example also of 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.930
 digital they are perennials 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.270
 art on the end 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.850
 we still have a small bouquet of flowers 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.190
 and we have to seed the seeds that 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.900
 make along the stems two solutions or 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.849
 you leave this stem with the seeds 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.510
 and you will be pleased to collect 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.490
 seeds 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.100
 or to see your digital without seeds 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.550
 and around that foot or you prefer 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.300
 have a new bloom at the base at 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.390
 that moment you cut your flower and 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.790
 along this stem will flourish 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.320
 other flowers is also the case of 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.140
 delphinium flowers with its 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.420
 gorgeous ample if you cut it in to 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.370
 about half there are other small ones 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.660
 secondary flowers that will emerge 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.520
 quickly 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.200
 concerning the missile antennas is 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.430
 interesting to remove all the flowers 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.030
 faded to favor a new 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.610
 flowering 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.500
 we see the buttons at the bottom so you 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.630
 also cut all these flowers 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.820
 within a fortnight you have 300 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.620
 more vegetation is also 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.250
 more flowers know as a rule 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.070
 General 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.600
 when you cut a flower you win 3 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.230
 buttons from behind that will be a lot 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.230
 more floriferous
