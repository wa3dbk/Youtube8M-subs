yeah my team wins pretty substantially

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.620 
yeah my team wins pretty substantially
so<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> really<00:00:32.309> fun<00:00:32.460> game<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
so it was it was a really fun game the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720 
so it was it was a really fun game the
the<00:00:34.079> map<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> battles<00:00:35.040> moved<00:00:35.430> pretty

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the map and the battles moved pretty

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.100 
the map and the battles moved pretty
dynamically<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.480> moved<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
dynamically they moved all over the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
dynamically they moved all over the
place<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> lot<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.860> fun<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
place so that was a lot of fun but the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.369 
place so that was a lot of fun but the
main<00:00:39.210> reason<00:00:39.239> why<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> wanted<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> make<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
main reason why I wanted to make this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
to deter people from actually sniping

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
to deter people from actually sniping

hill 137 I believe it's called I've

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
hill 137 I believe it's called I've
noticed<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:08.760> been<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.450> ridiculous

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
noticed that there's been a ridiculous

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
noticed that there's been a ridiculous
amount<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.320> snipers<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> map<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
amount of snipers on that map and it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.120 
amount of snipers on that map and it's
getting<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> point<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.650> my

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
getting to the point where you're not my

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530 
getting to the point where you're not my
team<00:01:14.340> isn't<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.729> able<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> win<00:01:15.299> because

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
team isn't actually able to win because

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
team isn't actually able to win because
no<00:01:16.140> one's<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.439> pushing<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.009> because

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
no one's actually pushing up because

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.800 
no one's actually pushing up because
they're<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.270> hill<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
they're all on that one hill for the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
they're all on that one hill for the
first<00:01:19.020> base<00:01:19.259> when<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.280> playing<00:01:20.460> rush<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
first base when you're playing rush on

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
first base when you're playing rush on
offense<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.530> happens<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.100> just

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
offense and when this happens it just

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590 
offense and when this happens it just
gets<00:01:23.490> pretty<00:01:23.880> frustrating<00:01:24.450> because

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
gets pretty frustrating because

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
gets pretty frustrating because
especially<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:27.090> you're<00:01:27.270> trying<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.540> move<00:01:27.750> up

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
especially if you're trying to move up

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
especially if you're trying to move up
as<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.829> team<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.400> kind<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
as well and your team is just kind of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
as well and your team is just kind of
sniping<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> backfield<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.920> not

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sniping in the backfield and just not

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
sniping in the backfield and just not
really<00:01:32.250> contributing<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> much<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.509> gets

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
really contributing that much it gets

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.880 
really contributing that much it gets
frustrating<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
frustrating because you know you want to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.740 
frustrating because you know you want to
win<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> they're<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.210> contributing

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
win and they're not really contributing

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
win and they're not really contributing
that<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.000> or

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that much so if there was just one or

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.249 
that much so if there was just one or
two<00:01:39.180> people<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.110> wouldn't

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
two people up there I really wouldn't

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.359 
two people up there I really wouldn't
have<00:01:40.320> any<00:01:40.530> problem<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.340> i

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
have any problem with that but when i

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.789 
have any problem with that but when i
sees<00:01:41.640> four<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.380> 6<00:01:43.680> or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
sees four or not four but more like 6 or

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.920 
sees four or not four but more like 6 or
7<00:01:44.130> even<00:01:44.280> 8<00:01:44.369> people<00:01:44.970> because<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.299> play<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.509> pc

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
7 even 8 people because i play on pc

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
7 even 8 people because i play on pc
there's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.770> lot<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> people<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.520> each<00:01:48.060> server

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
there's a lot of people on each server

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
there's a lot of people on each server
it<00:01:49.049> gets<00:01:49.320> kind<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> ridiculous<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
it gets kind of ridiculous and so

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760 
it gets kind of ridiculous and so
basically<00:01:51.360> i<00:01:51.540> wanted<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> take<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
basically i wanted to take the time to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
basically i wanted to take the time to
kind<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.070> talk<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.299> it's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
kind of talk about when I think it's

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.999 
kind of talk about when I think it's
appropriate<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:55.170> maybe<00:01:55.409> switch<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
appropriate to maybe switch to a

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.420 
appropriate to maybe switch to a
different<00:01:56.250> class<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.000> stop<00:01:57.630> sniping<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
different class and stop sniping and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.249 
different class and stop sniping and
hopefully<00:01:59.430> allow<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.509> team<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
hopefully allow your team to get the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.319 
hopefully allow your team to get the
mcom<00:02:01.530> stations<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> conquest

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
mcom stations or you know the conquest

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.700 
mcom stations or you know the conquest
points<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.810> actually<00:02:04.020> win<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> match<00:02:04.409> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
points and actually win the match so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.229 
points and actually win the match so
like<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.820> mentioned<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.450> hill<00:02:06.659> 137<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:08.209> lot<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
like I mentioned for hill 137 a lot of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.229 
like I mentioned for hill 137 a lot of
people<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> snipe<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:11.209> what<00:02:12.209> I

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
people like to snipe on that but what I

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.770 
people like to snipe on that but what I
what<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.660> think<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.200> should<00:02:13.349> do<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
what I think you really should do is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.730 
what I think you really should do is
if<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.900> find<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.230> there's<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.560> lot<00:02:14.680> of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
if you find that there's a lot of

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380 
if you find that there's a lot of
snipers<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.340> team<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.790> you're<00:02:16.300> not

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
snipers on your team and you're not

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.030 
snipers on your team and you're not
actually<00:02:16.600> able<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.020> push<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.620> would

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
actually able to push up I would

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.440 
actually able to push up I would
recommend<00:02:18.160> choosing<00:02:18.610> either<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.150> assault

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
recommend choosing either the assault

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.000 
recommend choosing either the assault
class<00:02:19.660> or<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.900> minute<00:02:20.170> class<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:20.830> just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
class or the minute class and then just

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.140 
class or the minute class and then just
doing<00:02:21.250> your<00:02:21.280> best<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.730> taking<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
doing your best and taking the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
doing your best and taking the
initiative<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.569> actually<00:02:23.050> push<00:02:23.260> up<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.650> get

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
initiative to actually push up and get

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.430

usually a solo player because I don't

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.880

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
usually what I do play I try to push up

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.080 
usually what I do play I try to push up
so<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.230> allies<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.830> spawn<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.190> me<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.550> I<00:03:03.880> try

so my allies can spawn on me and I try

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.059 
so my allies can spawn on me and I try
to<00:03:04.120> make<00:03:04.450> sure<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> give<00:03:05.170> my<00:03:05.380> allies<00:03:05.739> every

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
to make sure that I give my allies every

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.520 
to make sure that I give my allies every
opportunity<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.730> actually<00:03:07.170> push<00:03:08.170> towards<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
opportunity to actually push towards the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.750 
opportunity to actually push towards the
M<00:03:08.620> comm<00:03:08.769> station<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.250> take<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.519> advantage

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
M comm station and take the advantage

M comm station and take the advantage
that<00:03:10.150> I'm<00:03:10.660> hopefully<00:03:11.200> giving<00:03:11.380> them<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.550> in

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that I'm hopefully giving them so in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.910 
that I'm hopefully giving them so in
those<00:03:13.480> situations<00:03:14.050> if<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.290> notice<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> lot

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
those situations if I notice that a lot

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.350 
those situations if I notice that a lot
of<00:03:14.980> sniper<00:03:15.190> there's<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.610> lot<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.819> snipers<00:03:16.180> on<00:03:16.269> my

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
of sniper there's a lot of snipers on my

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.990 
of sniper there's a lot of snipers on my
team<00:03:16.600> I'll<00:03:16.780> switch<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.319> class<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
team I'll switch to a class and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.030 
team I'll switch to a class and
hopefully<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.209> push-up<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.230> allow<00:03:20.860> my

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
hopefully a push-up to allow my

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.120 
hopefully a push-up to allow my
teammates<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.730> get<00:03:22.030> better<00:03:22.560> field<00:03:23.560> advantage

over the enemy I actually made a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.490 
over the enemy I actually made a
complete<00:03:27.940> video<00:03:28.269> in<00:03:28.450> commentary<00:03:28.959> explaining

guy was so frustrated it was it was
pretty<00:03:46.480> frustrating<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.230> kind<00:03:47.440> of

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
pretty frustrating and I kind of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.470 
pretty frustrating and I kind of
explained<00:03:47.890> this<00:03:47.980> entire<00:03:48.310> thing<00:03:48.609> and<00:03:48.820> also<00:03:49.329> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
explained this entire thing and also a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.849 
explained this entire thing and also a
game<00:03:49.690> was<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> really<00:03:50.019> good<00:03:50.140> example<00:03:50.530> because<00:03:50.650> I

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
game was a really good example because I

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.460 
game was a really good example because I
did<00:03:51.160> have<00:03:51.640> such<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> great<00:03:52.060> match<00:03:52.359> but<00:03:53.170> because

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
did have such a great match but because

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.810 
did have such a great match but because
my<00:03:53.620> allies<00:03:53.920> weren't<00:03:54.220> pushing<00:03:54.400> up<00:03:54.670> they

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
my allies weren't pushing up they

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.099 
my allies weren't pushing up they
weren't<00:03:55.030> taking<00:03:55.269> advantage<00:03:55.630> of<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.959> fact

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
weren't taking advantage of the fact

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.150 
weren't taking advantage of the fact
that<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.530> know<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> was<00:03:56.769> killed<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> lot<00:03:57.100> of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
that you know I was killed a lot of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.099 
that you know I was killed a lot of
people<00:03:57.250> we<00:03:58.209> weren't<00:03:58.359> actually<00:03:58.570> able<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.959> get

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
people we weren't actually able to get

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.860

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
I'm sorry I'm actually very sorry that I

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.940 
I'm sorry I'm actually very sorry that I
wasn't<00:04:05.590> actually<00:04:05.859> able<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:08.470> know<00:04:08.590> show<00:04:08.799> it

wasn't actually able to you know show it

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.140 
wasn't actually able to you know show it
to<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.160> guys<00:04:09.280> because<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.760> was<00:04:09.880> such<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.060> good

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
to you guys because it was such a good

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.030 
to you guys because it was such a good
example<00:04:10.570> but<00:04:10.720> really<00:04:11.380> it<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:11.500> emphasized

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
example but really it just emphasized

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.099 
example but really it just emphasized
that<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.459> know<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:13.450> really<00:04:13.600> should<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.900> aware

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
that you know you really should be aware

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.930 
that you know you really should be aware
of<00:04:14.170> your<00:04:14.290> surroundings<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:15.400> also<00:04:15.640> what<00:04:15.820> your

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
of your surroundings and also what your

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.069 
of your surroundings and also what your
teammates<00:04:16.269> are<00:04:16.419> doing<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:16.840> if<00:04:16.930> they're<00:04:17.049> not

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
teammates are doing and if they're not

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.529 
teammates are doing and if they're not
really<00:04:17.880> doing<00:04:18.880> what<00:04:19.090> they<00:04:19.180> should<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.510> doing

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
really doing what they should be doing

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.120 
really doing what they should be doing
you<00:04:19.930> should<00:04:19.959> probably<00:04:20.440> do<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.709> best<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
you should probably do your best to

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.460 
you should probably do your best to
compensate<00:04:21.640> for<00:04:21.849> their<00:04:22.090> their<00:04:22.960> mistakes<00:04:23.320> not

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
compensate for their their mistakes not

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.779 
compensate for their their mistakes not
really<00:04:23.650> their<00:04:23.770> mistakes<00:04:24.099> but<00:04:24.340> just<00:04:24.550> for<00:04:24.700> their

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
really their mistakes but just for their

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.990 
really their mistakes but just for their
lack<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.030> aggression<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.659> guess

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
lack of aggression I guess

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.340 
lack of aggression I guess
so<00:04:27.000> that's<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.750> points<00:04:28.050> I<00:04:28.110> wanted

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
so that's really all the points I wanted

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.800 
so that's really all the points I wanted
to<00:04:28.530> mention<00:04:28.860> for<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.400> video<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.970> didn't<00:04:30.660> want

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
to mention for this video I didn't want

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.510 
to mention for this video I didn't want
to<00:04:30.870> ramble<00:04:31.200> on<00:04:31.320> too<00:04:31.590> much<00:04:31.770> about<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.400> know

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
to ramble on too much about you know

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.880 
to ramble on too much about you know
stop<00:04:32.790> sniping<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.300> all<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.510> jazz<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.990> just

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
stop sniping and all that jazz I just

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.050 
stop sniping and all that jazz I just
really<00:04:35.070> want<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.280> make<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.550> point<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.850> you

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
really want to make the point that you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.880 
really want to make the point that you
know<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.240> should<00:04:36.900> be<00:04:37.020> aware<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.350> what<00:04:37.770> your

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
know you should be aware of what your

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.230 
know you should be aware of what your
teammates<00:04:38.160> are<00:04:38.280> doing<00:04:38.460> like<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.760> said<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.210> just

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
teammates are doing like I said and just

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.350 
teammates are doing like I said and just
kind<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.020> adjust<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.740> gameplay<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:42.330> I

sure how I'm going to do this yet

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.550
