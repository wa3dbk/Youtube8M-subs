00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.960
 i 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.170
 program 18 your number sessions 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.180
 in this video they will be simplified and 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.180
 will build in your numbers sessions 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.760
 look at the following triangle 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.760
 see how it transforms 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.310
 amazing truth 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.290
 this type of phenomena has been part 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.510
 fundamental of the work that mathematicians 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.790
 and biologists have carried out during 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.100
 centuries making various discoveries 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.300
 among which the study of 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.520
 the sequences of numbers 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.920
 remember the sequences of numbers that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 we saw first grade 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 one of them was fibonacci with the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.900
 that you can build rectangles of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.150
 special proportions let's see 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 draw a square in your notebook 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.900
 measure 1 centimeter per side glued to this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.500
 Draw another square of the same size 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.830
 what figure is formed now how would it form 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.060
 is another rectangle drawn below the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.780
 two figures and other healthy other square 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.360
 what pattern is being followed 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.900
 on one side of the rectangle back to another 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.550
 square repeats the same procedure 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.170
 what characteristics do you see in the 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.480
 rectangles and on their sides of greater 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.430
 size 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.040
 what is the next term of the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.040
 succession if we continue with this process 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.459
 how many squares will have to be drawn 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.170
 to get a rectangle whose side 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.560
 larger measure 21 centimeters 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.349
 how can you know 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.150
 this succession of rectangles is known 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.430
 like fibonacci rectangles 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.530
 if we keep repeating the process 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.880
 we will get a rectangle known as 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.880
 golden rectangle 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.080
 You know that in the 13th century are well 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.270
 he had his first contact with 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 math when working in customs 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.890
 his Arab tutor who shared the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.910
 secrets of the positional numerical system 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.490
 two 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.220
 and his desire to have a better system of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.300
 public calculation in 1202 the leader downcast 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.050
 thus becoming the first 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.650
 mathematical compendium of the middle ages 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.129
 with others the fractals 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 let's see images of some are pretty 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.370
 do not 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.910
 and fractals have many 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.250
 mathematical properties but one of the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.170
 more surprising is that if you make a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.330
 approach to any of its parts 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.780
 you can observe the same structure 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.780
 original 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.000
 you can build some fractals of 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.080
 very simple way let's make one draw 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.360
 a triangle on a white sheet 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.190
 now divide the triangle with three 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.390
 lines that depart from the midpoints 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.250
 from its sides 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.810
 one of these points and color the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.340
 I just inverted box 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.959
 form with the color that you like 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.660
 what characteristics do you see in the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.370
 image 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.830
 how many triangles were formed 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.720
 Repeat the operation with each of the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.519
 triangles that appear in white and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 colors equal to all triangles 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.760
 inverted that result 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.420
 how many white triangles do you see 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.270
 now 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.950
 once again repeat the procedure with 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.240
 the new white triangles that are 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.160
 trained how many there are now 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.230
 to obtain the sequence of numbers of 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.610
 this triangle you just have to count the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:17.329
 white triangles that appear 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:19.250
 in each step 13 927 easy truth 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.919
 and if we continue with this process 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.790
 we would end up talking about fractals 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.710
 is to speak of infinity 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.700
 this simple fractal is known 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.500
 like the triangle of zielinski 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.630
 more would be the next term of the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.520
 succession as I would know 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.010
 after having seen the rectangles 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.260
 of fibonacci and the triangle of zielinski 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.940
 let's see a very simple succession 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.040
 and recognize it are the natural numbers 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.490
 to each number you add a unit to 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.260
 find the next one let's see a 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.550
 problem that became very famous 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.080
 thanks to a 10 year old boy 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:06.610
 as I would add in the numbers from 1 to 100 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:10.180
 to start we could add 12 + 34 more 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.120
 five months and so on until the 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.560
 100 would be very complicated and delayed 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.389
 add up like that you do not think 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.750
 you think of some other way of 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.750
 do what
