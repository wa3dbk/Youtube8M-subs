00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.390
 do not 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.840
 hello I want to show you as much as 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.840
 can open 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.280
 that is supposedly made for 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.770
 Right-handed but with the left hand 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.890
 without any problem 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.890
 why 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.470
 I do not know how the camera looks 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.500
 I think the camera has an effect of 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.540
 mirror in which the other way I tell them 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.900
 is on my right hand and this is my 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.220
 left hand as you see but 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.220
 on the camera will ask 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 d 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.470
 this is a can 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.470
 normal as a unicorn 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 caracas says with the right hand and another 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.170
 says with my left hand sorry for me 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.089
 childhood 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.489
 I just to show that if you 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.390
 can see in the manuel or right 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 opening the can opener 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.010
 He is depressed and continues now 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.160
 quietly 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.640
 well it's in my left hand then 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.890
 I'll do 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 make the hole back now 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.320
 Why is it like this 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.360
 we have to work here and place a 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.640
 then here, the same with the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.500
 left hand one work here and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.119
 place the tip here and do it in a 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.270
 area where you have not done the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.270
 hole 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.470
 and it's like that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.590
 says continuous 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 in the same way that with the right one it 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.110
 can open a can with a normal can 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 with the left 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.650
 the opposite movement but it is done 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.220
 and they help each other's hands if I 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 I do with the left 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.670
 that voice works here and you're getting all 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.060
 the tip inside the can if it's like that and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.140
 the same is done with the right locked and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.460
 I put all the point 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.830
 and I do things 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.420
 and that's all the video I just wanted 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.310
 show that it can be opened by hand 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.090
 left that is 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.090
 Thank you
