noticed<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:41.460> starting<00:01:41.790> from<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> hip<00:01:42.210> you're

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
noticed I'm starting from the hip you're

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.429 
noticed I'm starting from the hip you're
giving<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.320> real<00:01:43.740> side<00:01:44.070> spin<00:01:44.960> I'm<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.140> hang

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
giving that real side spin I'm also hang

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800 
giving that real side spin I'm also hang
the<00:01:46.560> ball<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> edge<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:47.640> bat<00:01:47.939> which

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the ball on the edge of my bat which

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
the ball on the edge of my bat which
gives<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> speed<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> spin<00:01:50.850> required<00:01:52.640> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
gives it the speed and spin required and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
gives it the speed and spin required and
I'm<00:01:53.850> finishing<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.540> an<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.020> back<00:01:55.290> hand

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I'm finishing in an all back hand

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.660 
I'm finishing in an all back hand
position<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> stroke<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
position the stroke is a really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
position the stroke is a really
effective<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.540> returning<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.290> short<00:01:58.710> serve

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
effective way of returning a short serve

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:16.280 
effective way of returning a short serve
or<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> short<00:01:59.939> push

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.720 

so<00:02:17.290> when<00:02:17.739> you're<00:02:17.890> playing<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.310> stroke<00:02:18.580> you

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
so when you're playing this stroke you

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.400 
so when you're playing this stroke you
need<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.000> think<00:02:19.180> about<00:02:19.390> how<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:19.840> backspin

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
need to think about how much backspin

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.050 
need to think about how much backspin
your<00:02:20.769> opponents<00:02:21.250> put<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> ball<00:02:21.819> if

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
your opponents put on the ball if

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.509 
your opponents put on the ball if
they've<00:02:22.750> put<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.989> lot<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.349> backspin<00:02:23.920> your

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
they've put a lot of backspin your

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.860 
they've put a lot of backspin your
stroke<00:02:24.790> needs<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.300> little<00:02:25.599> bit<00:02:25.720> more

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
stroke needs to be a little bit more

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.559 
stroke needs to be a little bit more
vertical<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.160> lift<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.760> ball<00:02:27.910> up<00:02:28.150> over<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
vertical so to lift the ball up over the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.110 
vertical so to lift the ball up over the
net<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.800> there's<00:02:30.040> no<00:02:30.280> spin<00:02:30.610> or<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.880> little

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
net but if there's no spin or a little

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.509 
net but if there's no spin or a little
bit<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.300> topspin<00:02:31.810> then<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.830> come<00:02:33.069> more

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
bit of topspin then you can come more

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.790 
bit of topspin then you can come more
forward<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.360> your<00:02:34.780> stroke<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.680> you're

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
forward on your stroke so that you're

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 
forward on your stroke so that you're
getting<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.099> ball<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.459> forward<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.630> real

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
getting the ball going forward the real

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.199 
getting the ball going forward the real
advantage<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.560> stroke<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:40.030> an

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
advantage of this stroke is that it's an

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.150 
advantage of this stroke is that it's an
attacking<00:02:40.600> stroke<00:02:41.049> off<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> short<00:02:41.620> ball<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
attacking stroke off a short ball and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.800 
attacking stroke off a short ball and
that<00:02:42.700> means<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.090> you're<00:02:43.330> taking<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
that means that you're taking the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.170 
that means that you're taking the
initiative<00:02:44.110> in<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.650> rally<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.730> side

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
initiative in the rally and the side

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.270 
initiative in the rally and the side
spin<00:02:46.569> makes<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.350> awkward<00:02:47.500> for<00:02:48.010> your

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
spin makes it really awkward for your

00:02:48.280 --> 00:03:14.819 
spin makes it really awkward for your
opponent<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.910> return<00:03:13.170> from<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.350> angle<00:03:14.530> you

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
opponent to return from this angle you

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.160 
opponent to return from this angle you
can<00:03:14.980> really<00:03:15.220> see<00:03:15.430> how<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.730> side<00:03:16.120> spin<00:03:16.420> causes

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
can really see how the side spin causes

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.990 
can really see how the side spin causes
the<00:03:17.260> ball<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.620> curve<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.250> make<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.760> difficult

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
the ball to curve and make it difficult

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:37.369 
the ball to curve and make it difficult
for<00:03:19.299> your<00:03:19.480> opponent

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.170 

so<00:03:38.379> there<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:39.129> back<00:03:39.340> end<00:03:39.580> side<00:03:39.849> spin

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
so there you have the back end side spin

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.869 
so there you have the back end side spin
flick<00:03:40.620> don't<00:03:41.620> forget<00:03:41.980> that's<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.610> very

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
flick don't forget that's a very

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.360 
flick don't forget that's a very
advanced<00:03:43.540> technique<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.620> takes<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:45.010> lot<00:03:45.340> of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
advanced technique and it takes a lot of

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.009 
advanced technique and it takes a lot of
years<00:03:45.610> of<00:03:45.700> practice<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.269> master

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
years of practice to master

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.440 
years of practice to master
it's<00:03:47.860> taken<00:03:48.220> me<00:03:48.250> several<00:03:48.580> years<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.970> master<00:03:49.390> it

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
it's taken me several years to master it

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.120 
it's taken me several years to master it
myself

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.190
