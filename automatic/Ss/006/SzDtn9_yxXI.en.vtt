00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
for it to be easier all you have to do

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.140 
for it to be easier all you have to do
is<00:03:24.860> cuddle<00:03:25.100> them<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.519> hit<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.970> don't

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
is cuddle them and hit it you don't

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.470

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
really have to switch that on loss and I

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.330

suggest<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.080> wait<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> TNT<00:03:33.799> boils

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
suggest that you wait to the TNT boils

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.740 
suggest that you wait to the TNT boils
all<00:03:34.489> before<00:03:34.820> you<00:03:34.910> put<00:03:35.120> another<00:03:35.360> one<00:03:35.570> down

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.060 
all before you put another one down
how's<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.709> hole<00:03:36.890> will<00:03:37.040> be<00:03:37.070> at<00:03:37.310> all<00:03:37.549> messed<00:03:37.880> up

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.590 

this<00:03:43.070> is<00:03:43.220> also<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.519> great<00:03:43.820> way<00:03:43.850> for<00:03:44.060> finding

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
this is also a great way for finding

00:03:44.600 --> 00:04:14.080
