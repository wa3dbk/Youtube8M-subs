00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
dragon attack for this episode I don't

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
dragon attack for this episode I don't
want<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> ruin<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> attack<00:01:52.829> strategy<00:01:53.369> for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
want to ruin this attack strategy for

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.399 
want to ruin this attack strategy for
you<00:01:53.670> guys<00:01:53.850> by<00:01:54.149> seeing<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> over<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> over

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you guys by seeing it over and over

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
you guys by seeing it over and over
again<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.369> because<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.240> effective<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
again but because it is so effective it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.440 
again but because it is so effective it
is<00:01:58.140> tough<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> use<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.000> problem<00:02:00.329> with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is tough not to use the problem with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
is tough not to use the problem with
using<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:01.020> attack<00:02:01.409> strategy<00:02:01.979> though<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
using this attack strategy though is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.330 
using this attack strategy though is
that<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.090> expensive<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.200> can't<00:02:04.799> seem<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> ever

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
that it's expensive I can't seem to ever

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.700 
that it's expensive I can't seem to ever
get<00:02:05.670> enough<00:02:05.969> elixir<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> strategy<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
get enough elixir with this strategy and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
get enough elixir with this strategy and
I<00:02:08.160> need<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:08.759> barracks<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.420> dark<00:02:09.720> spell

I need to get my barracks in dark spell

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.350 
I need to get my barracks in dark spell
factory-built<00:02:10.890> I'll<00:02:11.310> need<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.910> switch<00:02:12.150> over

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
factory-built I'll need to switch over

to a new strategy on
next<00:02:14.010> episode<00:02:14.299> what<00:02:15.299> strategy<00:02:15.870> should<00:02:15.930> i<00:02:16.140> use

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
next episode what strategy should i use

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.039 
next episode what strategy should i use
for<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.430> episode<00:02:17.849> though<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.659> have<00:02:18.810> more

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
for this episode though we have more

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
than enough gold to start our last

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.520 
than enough gold to start our last
builder<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.420> these<00:02:21.629> few<00:02:21.900> attacks<00:02:22.230> will<00:02:22.500> be

at this attack you guys I was so proud

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.539 
at this attack you guys I was so proud
of<00:02:29.579> it<00:02:29.879> I<00:02:30.090> mean<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.840> am<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.409> fresh<00:02:31.769> town'll<00:02:32.280> eight

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
of it I mean I am a fresh town'll eight

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.819 
of it I mean I am a fresh town'll eight
you<00:02:33.299> could<00:02:33.510> possibly<00:02:33.720> still<00:02:34.409> call<00:02:34.680> me<00:02:34.799> a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
you could possibly still call me a

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.069 
you could possibly still call me a
tunnel<00:02:35.250> seven<00:02:35.730> since<00:02:36.180> all<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.359> my<00:02:36.569> troops<00:02:36.870> are

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
tunnel seven since all of my troops are

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.020 
tunnel seven since all of my troops are
still<00:02:37.349> only<00:02:37.500> town<00:02:37.769> all<00:02:37.950> seven<00:02:38.459> but<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
still only town all seven but I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.179 
still only town all seven but I
completely<00:02:39.390> clear<00:02:39.959> out<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> tunnel<00:02:40.680> eight<00:02:40.859> with

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
completely clear out a tunnel eight with

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.729 
completely clear out a tunnel eight with
this<00:02:41.400> strategy<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:42.209> believe<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.290> all<00:02:43.319> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
this strategy I believe that of all the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.970 
this strategy I believe that of all the
strategies<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.909> game<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:46.019> has<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.859> be

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
strategies in the game this has to be

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.339 
strategies in the game this has to be
number<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.579> no<00:02:48.180> other<00:02:48.389> strategy<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.170> game

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
number one no other strategy in the game

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.890 
number one no other strategy in the game
is<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> hundred<00:02:49.980> percent<00:02:50.099> guarantee<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.629> this

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
is a hundred percent guarantee like this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.170 
is a hundred percent guarantee like this
one<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.379> I'm<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.579> look<00:02:53.849> hard

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
one is I'm going to need to look hard

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.420 
one is I'm going to need to look hard
for<00:02:54.420> another<00:02:54.599> strategy<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.889> for

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
for another strategy like this one for

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.729 
for another strategy like this one for
Channel<00:02:56.790> 8<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.359> remember<00:02:58.019> my<00:02:58.139> last<00:02:58.349> journey

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
Channel 8 I remember my last journey

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.920 
Channel 8 I remember my last journey
through<00:02:59.010> tunnel<00:02:59.370> eight<00:02:59.549> though<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.480> was<00:03:00.659> very

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
through tunnel eight though it was very

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.110 
through tunnel eight though it was very

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
difficult taking on other town all eight

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.330 
difficult taking on other town all eight
