kills within four minutes this round

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
kills within four minutes this round
because<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.539> game<00:00:45.719> didn't<00:00:46.050> even<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> full

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
because the game didn't even go the full

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
because the game didn't even go the full
time<00:00:47.039> limit<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.399> game<00:00:47.640> went<00:00:47.850> until<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:49.110> was

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
time limit the game went until there was

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
time limit the game went until there was
like<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> minute<00:00:49.620> left<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> clock<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
like a minute left on the clock so the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
like a minute left on the clock so the
game<00:00:51.149> ended<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.899> ended<00:00:52.140> up

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
game ended and we just ended up

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
game ended and we just ended up
capturing<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.920> still<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.250> good<00:00:53.460> gameplay

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
capturing but still is good gameplay

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
capturing but still is good gameplay
nonetheless<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.329> super<00:00:54.719> fast<00:00:54.930> pace<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.710> know

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
nonetheless is super fast pace you know

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
nonetheless is super fast pace you know
that<00:00:56.219> equates<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:57.719> failing

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that equates to like look at me failing

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
that equates to like look at me failing
I<00:00:58.320> try<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.800> shoot<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> dead<00:00:59.430> body<00:00:59.640> after<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I try to shoot the dead body after I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
I try to shoot the dead body after I
already<00:01:00.239> killed<00:01:00.539> him<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.930> hate<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
already killed him I hate how the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
already killed him I hate how the
blackbird<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.629> vsat<00:01:04.110> rather<00:01:04.409> takes<00:01:05.100> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
blackbird or the vsat rather takes like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
blackbird or the vsat rather takes like
a<00:01:05.369> couple<00:01:05.460> seconds<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> enemies<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> fade

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
a couple seconds for the enemies to fade

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
a couple seconds for the enemies to fade
away<00:01:07.200> after<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> kill<00:01:08.010> them<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.790> kind

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
away after you kill them because it kind

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
away after you kill them because it kind
of<00:01:09.090> Miss<00:01:10.080> represents<00:01:11.070> where<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> my

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
of Miss represents where they are in my

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
of Miss represents where they are in my
opinion<00:01:12.000> sometimes<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.750> throws<00:01:12.930> me<00:01:12.960> off

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
opinion sometimes it just throws me off

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
opinion sometimes it just throws me off
sometimes<00:01:13.860> I'll<00:01:14.130> go<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> shoot<00:01:14.790> someone<00:01:15.090> who's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.570 
gonna make the rest of the game that
much<00:02:57.900> harder<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.410> my<00:02:58.590> suggestion<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
much harder so my suggestion for you is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.550 
much harder so my suggestion for you is
to<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.970> relax<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.600> think<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.380> like<00:03:01.500> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to just relax and think of it like a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.260 
to just relax and think of it like a
fresh<00:03:01.830> start<00:03:02.100> you<00:03:02.220> know<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.640> change<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
fresh start you know the change of the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.090 
fresh start you know the change of the
rounds<00:03:03.600> personally<00:03:04.200> I'm<00:03:04.380> not<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.590> fan<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.070> I

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
rounds personally I'm not a fan of it I

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.190 
rounds personally I'm not a fan of it I
think<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.430> kill<00:03:05.640> some<00:03:05.820> momentum<00:03:06.270> but<00:03:06.840> there

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
think you kill some momentum but there

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.170 
think you kill some momentum but there
are<00:03:07.230> times<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:08.010> you're<00:03:08.160> doing<00:03:08.460> bad<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
are times when you're doing bad and it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.030 
are times when you're doing bad and it
kind<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.020> can<00:03:10.170> kind<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.410> see<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.680> as<00:03:10.800> like<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
kind of you can kind of see it as like a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.500 
kind of you can kind of see it as like a
fresh<00:03:11.310> start<00:03:11.580> that's<00:03:11.850> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.090> what<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.270> try<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
fresh start that's kind of what I try to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.690 
fresh start that's kind of what I try to
do<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.810> game<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> tried<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> consciously<00:03:14.040> say

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
do this game I tried to consciously say

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.990 
do this game I tried to consciously say
you<00:03:14.760> know<00:03:15.120> what<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:16.190> may<00:03:17.190> have<00:03:17.340> started<00:03:17.520> off<00:03:17.760> not

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
you know what I may have started off not

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
you know what I may have started off not
that<00:03:18.210> well<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.810> there's<00:03:19.170> still<00:03:19.320> time<00:03:19.710> for<00:03:19.920> me

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
that well but there's still time for me

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.980 
that well but there's still time for me
to<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.220> something<00:03:20.460> better<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.300> there's<00:03:21.750> still

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
to do something better and there's still

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.890 
to do something better and there's still
a<00:03:22.320> possibility<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:23.340> i<00:03:23.550> can<00:03:23.910> improve<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.810> i

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
a possibility that i can improve and i

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.750 
a possibility that i can improve and i
could<00:03:25.080> do<00:03:25.260> better<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.220> game<00:03:26.460> which<00:03:26.640> is

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
could do better this game which is

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.960 
could do better this game which is
exactly<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.240> happened<00:03:27.800> so<00:03:28.800> it's<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.670> know<00:03:29.760> a

exactly what happened so it's you know a
lot<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.510> due<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.810> streaks<00:03:31.170> of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
lot of it is due to the streaks of

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.290 
lot of it is due to the streaks of
course<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.760> general<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.210> know
