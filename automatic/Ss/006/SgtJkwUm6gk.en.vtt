00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.880
 jean michel vaujour it goes out gasoline ban you decided to kill there 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.089
 from that few weeks to succeed jean-guy break out 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 khiter and the recruiting cell for auch at the top the crampons 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.779
 val-d'or for the end I'm a bit of both but it's true that I'm going 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.529
 ask the president that if he had to coach karin and it's going to last 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.650
 two days proposed for the post of deputy 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.400
 so I had come alone 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.800
 but he offered me in the complaint to accept it 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 that you missed the wish to be found a little like that the flavor of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.659
 the same if I had never been very far away 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.370
 but it's not the same thing that I learned a lot about everything 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.749
 world what's going on in the football club that I did not know 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:36.510
 necessarily 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.780
 now the field was missing players because I was too heavy and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.090
 fermentations 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.460
 and this morning it was 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.360
 the first back to school for you and the players 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.560
 the acnusa a particular emotion or when you are found in the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.760
 cloakroom with 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
 with the staff having just happy happy to do what I love 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.040
 and to live of my passion also especially evening m 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.130
 hoping we're going to have a very good season 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.680
 with that without tigana you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.570
 you knew for a little bit even mans professional lack of 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.729
 donors the opah habitat is planning a qualitative rise home chaumette 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.130
 the idea for later we played often against the biggest accounts and of 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.700
 Deep enters your book please 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690
 it's true that I do not promise you especially but she does not know anyone 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.090
 more or less 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.039
 but how will be the sharing of roles 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.860
 a little bit 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 I'm thinking upwards 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.110
 the good there is especially eric heyer an early season and we will talk 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 science since that's all especially athletic performance me I think that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.560
 during the animations of the youngest games it will be tactical 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.429
 our ambition 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.809
 belotti staff is positive and this season my ambition is to win the 

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:37.230
 more matches possible around his nose 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.580
 I think people born in very very bad 15 minutes 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.829
 students have to do it 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 he wants us to try to give a euro 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 of rigor to this group because the quality is there the two had followed 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.970
 this little parenthesis but necessarily civil 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.980
 % and the World Cup still unfolding for the French 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.280
 in the general feeling about them what happened to them 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.690
 but for France yes 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.670
 for me g I'm a little ashamed to be pros 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.520
 as much as I can understand the demonstrations but not train in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.659
 e whereas at the price of one of the countries of 60 million people I be the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.610
 do not design 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 at home I plug was buschhaus output even though the same as two 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.619
 others were not happy 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.979
 but not holding who can loot that manifest some problem that I 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.989
 design it but not in this way but both would have been exchanged 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.570
 at that moment you would have taken the initiative of descent of the bus 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.790
 yes yes it's not exactly the same as a club with the beautiful role but it 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.060
 must see things that pushes it can happen 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.690
 now in addition between 70 years of people are still doing it it's 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 simone fatima but the tonnage of the middle ports to know what happened 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.590
 exactly but I think they did not measure 2 the point is the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.489
 repercussion that it could have in front 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.560
 m you may have in a tobacco sionneau girondins team france 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.759
 on the phone with her and their resentment to their state of mind 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.459
 good we will talk before to take especially vettel should have especially 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.979
 sounds produced by what he saw 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.239
 to convey it knows if these last months very difficult that I am and 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.569
 Bordeaux to the team of France 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.899
 in addition I mark because he always wants more 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.659
 all our Polish nationals who lives that I think it would be difficult to 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.069
 better to evacuate a maximum of 7 hours 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.939
 that of what's more in the month of January to die in great shape regarding 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.849
 precisely mark that had a small sprain to seem restored and its 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.920
 rituals that is hurt or 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.920
 you think to get them back to an opponent mark 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.069
 to see that will go until who will come are too much pain always 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.669
 wrong 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.039
 you can go down even if I can not work less than an hour - 

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:26.159
 damaging I am suspended the first two friendlies so he will have a 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.859
 a little more time very well a word about% 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.229
 the workforce alas it is brought to 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.279
 az getting muscular 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.019
 to be partially changed in the days the coming weeks 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.099
 assured that a priority one would like to have a water could infer that 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.609
 according to the players who 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.079
 who was leaving members by this post for post 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.140
 so for now the priority is in vacant chestnut 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.709
 Well yes when we see the size of the municipal heritage 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.819
 the poem 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.229
 speak I did a little bit of Latin before you come on this 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.149
 tray at the complaint two weeks I knew the particular net david 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.979
 Trezeguet 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.019
 for as much as a year ago that I ask you not to denounce alerter 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.040
 here it is gone jean tigana replied to a horse no other 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.650
 candidate beat 2-0 three dads compared to the players this is in relation to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.760
 his injuries that goes on and on for two hours and then the finish he 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.470
 add that we start but it's like that at least it does not work out if the bbc 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.599
 a selection of games 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.999
 I will speak differently 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:20.120
 but it's true that already has the years has not made a lot of matches 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.669
 but hey it's still a great scorer and a great player the agreement so we have good 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.190
 including everything you are looking for first and foremost 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.740
 for an attacker to overcome the departure of marouane chamakh and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.569
 imagine on several tracks 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.849
 it is certainly not expected anymore we wait for the end of the world ladies 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.789
 no because I believe that now we are not ashamed 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.919
 they say to themselves I reassure you that's what all the presidents of 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.869
 clubs that anyway this period is calm in term of transfer window first 

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:41.819
 because there is the crisis 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.830
 it's there it impacts everyone and then because yossi global and we 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.900
 awaits a bit in the world for the young shoots of the postern chocolate 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:51.020
 finish earlier this year where we are there we have until August 31 it would be 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.999
 still coaches like to have their boots already 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.940
 bluffed 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.310
 before the first match 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.250
 but also also that it takes a budget properly impact reindeer 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.620
 the mu striker is of a good standard so the coins died in Rome not like 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.669
 expected it takes 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.520
 I guess I'll let Michel get back to the ground 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.219
 workout because it's double ration this week for him the 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.780
 according to the unions from saint-boniface in triplicate
