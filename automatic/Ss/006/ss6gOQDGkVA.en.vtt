actually<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.789> probably<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> longest

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
actually this is probably the longest

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200 
actually this is probably the longest
drawn-out<00:00:27.960> mergers<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.500> history<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.820> want

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
drawn-out mergers in history they want

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
drawn-out mergers in history they want
to<00:00:30.359> merge<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.570> sirius<00:00:31.140> satellite<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> XM

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to merge with sirius satellite now XM

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
to merge with sirius satellite now XM
and<00:00:33.420> sirius<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> only<00:00:34.170> two<00:00:34.410> satellite

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and sirius are the only two satellite

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.470 
and sirius are the only two satellite
companies<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.850> there's<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> lot<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> people

satellite<00:01:24.570> radio<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.880> two

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
satellite radio but you know you got two

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.360 
satellite radio but you know you got two
companies<00:01:27.720> doing<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.230> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
companies doing this so it's a lot of

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.220 
companies doing this so it's a lot of
content<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.780> don't<00:01:30.900> there's

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
content out there and they don't there's

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.380 
content out there and they don't there's
there's<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.160> lot<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.430> overlap<00:01:32.910> between<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
there's not a lot of overlap between the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.780 
there's not a lot of overlap between the
two<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:35.000> they<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.510> saying<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:38.490> they<00:01:38.640> want

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
two and they are saying that they want

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.150 
two and they are saying that they want
to<00:01:38.850> merge<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.350> FCC<00:01:40.350> i<00:01:40.530> think<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.950> still

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
to merge and FCC i think is still

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.070 
to merge and FCC i think is still
looking<00:01:41.400> into<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.910> i<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.450> still<00:01:42.780> are

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
looking into it i think they still are

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.900 
looking into it i think they still are
some<00:01:43.530> people<00:01:43.650> who<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.070> trying<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.369> prove<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
some people who are trying to prove it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.330 
some people who are trying to prove it
but<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:46.080> don't<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.770> should<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:46.950> approved

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
but i don't think it should be approved

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580 
but i don't think it should be approved
I<00:01:47.550> think<00:01:47.790> Sirius<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.240> XM<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.930> good<00:01:49.320> thing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
I think Sirius and XM have a good thing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.160 
I think Sirius and XM have a good thing
going<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.750> competition<00:01:51.750> between<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
going the the competition between the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
going the the competition between the
two<00:01:52.290> companies<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:53.060> forcing<00:01:54.060> them<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
two companies is forcing them to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.710 
two companies is forcing them to
innovate<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:56.070> were<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.940> merge<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.570> will

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
innovate if they were to merge they will

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.900 
innovate if they were to merge they will
just<00:01:57.900> sit<00:01:58.200> back<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.500> owned<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.460> satellite

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
just sit back and owned the satellite

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.690 
just sit back and owned the satellite
radio<00:02:00.270> space<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.710> kind<00:02:02.400> of<00:02:02.460> believe

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
radio space now I kind of believe

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.430 
radio space now I kind of believe
satellite<00:02:03.180> radio<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.720> traditional<00:02:04.170> radio

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
satellite radio in traditional radio

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.010 
satellite radio in traditional radio
overlap<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.190> some<00:02:05.369> areas<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.540> others<00:02:06.840> they

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
overlap in some areas but in others they

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
overlap in some areas but in others they
don't<00:02:07.260> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.040> ones<00:02:08.250> there<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.760> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
don't and I think the ones there is that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.090 
don't and I think the ones there is that
they<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.269> overlap<00:02:09.600> are<00:02:10.019> important<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.679> think

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
they don't overlap are important i think

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.430 
they don't overlap are important i think
satellite<00:02:11.760> radio<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.300> another<00:02:12.750> choice<00:02:13.019> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
satellite radio is another choice and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.259 
satellite radio is another choice and
within<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.459> choice<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.970> should<00:02:15.000> have

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
within that choice you should have

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.140 
within that choice you should have
choices<00:02:16.459> these<00:02:17.459> companies<00:02:17.880> should<00:02:18.030> be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
choices these companies should be

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
choices these companies should be
innovating<00:02:18.690> they<00:02:18.810> should<00:02:19.019> be<00:02:19.170> competing<00:02:19.680> they

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
innovating they should be competing they

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
innovating they should be competing they
should<00:02:20.040> be<00:02:20.220> they<00:02:20.700> should<00:02:20.730> be<00:02:20.970> doing<00:02:21.239> things<00:02:21.480> to
