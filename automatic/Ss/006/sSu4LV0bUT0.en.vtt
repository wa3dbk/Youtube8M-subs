320 gig goodbye of storage and wealth it
is<00:00:23.760> compatible<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> windows<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
is compatible with the windows and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.700 
is compatible with the windows and
macintosh<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:27.109> Macintosh<00:00:28.109> users<00:00:28.519> we<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
macintosh for Macintosh users we have to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.270 
macintosh for Macintosh users we have to
format<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.390> on<00:00:33.390> HFS<00:00:33.920> because<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.130> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
format it on HFS because this is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.110 
format it on HFS because this is
currently<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.969> ntfs<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> side<00:00:39.090> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
currently on ntfs so this is the side of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.920 
currently on ntfs so this is the side of
the<00:00:39.300> box<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.489> power<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.059> activity<00:00:42.750> like

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the box you have power and activity like

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.959 
the box you have power and activity like
that<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> let's<00:00:48.020> open<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that so let's open it this is not the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:03.590 
that so let's open it this is not the
first<00:00:51.000> time

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350 

so<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.870> design<00:01:05.199> is<00:01:05.410> very<00:01:05.440> small<00:01:06.280> i<00:01:06.790> think<00:01:07.120> is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
so the design is very small i think is

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.500 
so the design is very small i think is
smallest<00:01:08.080> i've<00:01:08.440> seen<00:01:09.270> comparing<00:01:10.270> with<00:01:10.450> a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
smallest i've seen comparing with a

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.960 
smallest i've seen comparing with a
maxtor<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:13.150> size<00:01:13.360> comparison<00:01:14.460> thickness

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.040 

and

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.440 
and
so<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.920> comes<00:01:22.850> with<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.360> USB<00:01:23.780> cable<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.530> course

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
so it comes with the USB cable of course

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:35.190 
so it comes with the USB cable of course
USB<00:01:26.450> cable<00:01:31.060> nicely<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.690> long<00:01:33.610> short<00:01:34.610> again

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
USB cable nicely not so long short again

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.090 
USB cable nicely not so long short again
comes<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:36.470> some<00:01:37.280> documentation<00:01:40.720> yeah<00:01:42.100> so

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
comes with some documentation yeah so

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.350 
comes with some documentation yeah so
okay<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:45.110> USB<00:01:45.710> port<00:01:46.010> on<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.970> hard<00:01:47.270> drive

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
okay the USB port on the hard drive

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.000 
okay the USB port on the hard drive
itself<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.080> actually<00:01:48.500> different<00:01:49.450> from<00:01:50.950> say<00:01:51.950> it

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
itself is actually different from say it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.780 
itself is actually different from say it
is<00:01:52.300> different<00:01:53.300> from<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.900> maxxtow<00:01:54.530> or<00:01:54.790> any

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
is different from the maxxtow or any

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.080 
is different from the maxxtow or any
other<00:01:56.410> external<00:01:57.410> harddrive<00:01:57.980> that<00:01:58.280> uses<00:01:58.700> USB

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
other external harddrive that uses USB

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.610 
other external harddrive that uses USB
so<00:01:59.930> let's<00:02:00.230> compare<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:01.660> this<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.990> western

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
so let's compare it this is the western

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.200 
so let's compare it this is the western
digital<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.130> this<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:05.350> normal<00:02:06.350> USB<00:02:06.860> cable<00:02:07.280> so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
digital and this is normal USB cable so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.660 
digital and this is normal USB cable so
basically<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.350> western<00:02:09.770> digital<00:02:09.890> one<00:02:10.310> for

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
basically the western digital one for

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.580 
basically the western digital one for
this<00:02:10.880> particular<00:02:11.090> hard<00:02:11.630> drive<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.110> actually

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
this particular hard drive is actually

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.220 
this particular hard drive is actually
slimmer<00:02:16.240> hopefully<00:02:17.240> you<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.630> see<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.050> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
slimmer hopefully you can see it and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.010 
slimmer hopefully you can see it and
part<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.250> actually<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.300> see<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.900> is

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
part is actually you can see it it is

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.260 
part is actually you can see it it is
slimmer

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.250 

okay<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.080> thing<00:02:26.970> ok<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> hard<00:02:29.050> drive<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
okay I thing ok on the hard drive is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.130 
okay I thing ok on the hard drive is
solved<00:02:29.710> we<00:02:29.830> have<00:02:30.070> logo<00:02:30.970> west<00:02:31.360> end<00:02:31.540> result<00:02:31.930> here

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
solved we have logo west end result here

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.890 
solved we have logo west end result here
if<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.380> can<00:02:32.530> see

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.039 

this<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> design<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:38.330> black<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.629> red

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
this is the design of black and red

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.009 
this is the design of black and red
looks<00:02:41.510> like<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> bad<00:02:42.810> boy<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:44.599> for<00:02:45.599> some<00:02:45.810> kind

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
looks like a bad boy and for some kind

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.830 
looks like a bad boy and for some kind
of<00:02:46.170> engraving<00:02:47.069> my<00:02:47.370> passport<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.209> few<00:02:48.599> and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
of engraving my passport and few and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.149 
of engraving my passport and few and
graves<00:02:49.079> or<00:02:49.409> the<00:02:50.060> quality<00:02:51.060> check<00:02:51.329> stock<00:02:51.659> and

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
graves or the quality check stock and

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.930 
graves or the quality check stock and
level<00:02:53.159> so<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.819> says<00:02:54.560> 320<00:02:55.560> gigabyte<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.190> guess<00:02:56.700> on

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
level so it says 320 gigabyte I guess on

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.990 
level so it says 320 gigabyte I guess on
the<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.510> /<00:02:57.840> end<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.379> don't<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.849> is<00:02:59.970> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the be / end I don't know so this is a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.710 
the be / end I don't know so this is a
320<00:03:00.900> gigabyte<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.769> mean<00:03:02.370> 320<00:03:03.180> gigabyte<00:03:03.510> stuff

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
320 gigabyte I mean 320 gigabyte stuff

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.220 
320 gigabyte I mean 320 gigabyte stuff
so<00:03:04.409> I<00:03:05.269> think<00:03:06.269> that's<00:03:06.420> about<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.659> thank<00:03:07.079> you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
so I think that's about it thank you

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.560
