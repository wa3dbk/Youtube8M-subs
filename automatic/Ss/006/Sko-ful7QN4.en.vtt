billion<00:00:30.599> whatever<00:00:31.160> but<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.969> goes<00:00:33.420> up

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
billion whatever but then what goes up

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.209 
billion whatever but then what goes up
must<00:00:34.260> come<00:00:34.469> down

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
must come down

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.750 
must come down
and<00:00:35.780> if<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> jumped<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.500> N<00:00:37.649> equals<00:00:37.980> four<00:00:38.309> its

and if it jumped up to N equals four its

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.020 
and if it jumped up to N equals four its
God<00:00:39.110> jumped<00:00:40.110> back<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
God jumped back down but it can do that

equals two it'll eventually make it to N
equals<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.500> trust<00:00:53.039> me<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.899> we're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
equals one trust me but for now we're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.860 
equals one trust me but for now we're
talking<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:56.550> N<00:00:56.730> equals<00:00:57.000> four<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
talking about from N equals four down to

eighth centimeters per second and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.800 
eighth centimeters per second and
finally<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.960> these<00:01:43.439> shell<00:01:43.979> numbers<00:01:44.810> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
finally we need these shell numbers this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.889 
finally we need these shell numbers this
is<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.170> shell<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.470> start<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.340> 1<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.780> it's

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
is the shell you start in and 1 so it's

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.429 
is the shell you start in and 1 so it's
1<00:01:49.110> over<00:01:49.140> 4<00:01:49.860> squared<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> shell

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
1 over 4 squared and this is the shell

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
1 over 4 squared and this is the shell
you<00:01:52.470> end<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.189> 1<00:01:54.149> over<00:01:54.450> 2<00:01:55.020> squared<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:57.210> you'll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
you end in 1 over 2 squared what you'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830 
you end in 1 over 2 squared what you'll
notice<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.130> these<00:01:59.130> are<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.360> units

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
notice is that these are all these units

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690 
notice is that these are all these units
just<00:02:01.020> cancel<00:02:01.619> each<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.399> all

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
just cancel each other out as all

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.230 
just cancel each other out as all
numbers<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:03.990> here<00:02:04.170> check<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.030> meters<00:02:06.030> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
numbers right here check it meters to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.109 
numbers right here check it meters to
the<00:02:06.270> minus<00:02:06.659> 1<00:02:06.869> cancels<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.680> meters

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
the minus 1 cancels that with meters

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.600 
the minus 1 cancels that with meters
seconds<00:02:09.149> cancer

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
seconds cancer

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.970 
seconds cancer
so<00:02:09.700> seconds<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.899> answer<00:02:11.320> we<00:02:11.500> get<00:02:11.770> is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
so seconds and the answer we get is

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.340 
so seconds and the answer we get is
going<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:12.760> joules<00:02:13.210> now<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.290> is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
going to be in just joules now this is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.230 
going to be in just joules now this is
