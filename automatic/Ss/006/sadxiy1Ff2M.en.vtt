00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
about this game our first time that on

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680 
about this game our first time that on
oftens<00:00:38.309> he<00:00:38.430> sent<00:00:38.640> some<00:00:38.790> pressure<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
oftens he sent some pressure it got to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
oftens he sent some pressure it got to
us<00:00:39.719> his<00:00:40.410> first<00:00:40.620> amount<00:00:40.829> offens<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.370> sent<00:00:41.610> some

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
us his first amount offens we sent some

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
pressure it got to him so this should be

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560

the<00:00:43.829> battle<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> defenses<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.210> think<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the battle of the defenses but I think I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
the battle of the defenses but I think I
can<00:00:45.750> adjust<00:00:46.110> better<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.980> his<00:00:47.129> pressure<00:00:47.399> then

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
can adjust better to his pressure then

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
can adjust better to his pressure then
he<00:00:47.700> gets<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.000> mind<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:49.200> gonna
