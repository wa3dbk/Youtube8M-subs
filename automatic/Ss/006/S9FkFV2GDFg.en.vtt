you<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> new<00:00:12.599> glitch<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> map<00:00:13.380> bus<00:00:13.710> depot<00:00:14.219> on

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
you a new glitch on the map bus depot on

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.930 
you a new glitch on the map bus depot on
the<00:00:15.660> game-mode<00:00:16.230> transit<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.430> what<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> need

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
the game-mode transit so what you need

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.120 
the game-mode transit so what you need
first<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> vine<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.500> at<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> place<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
first is get a vine so at the place that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
first is get a vine so at the place that
we're<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> turbine<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.660> inside

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
we're at now get a turbine from inside

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.340 
we're at now get a turbine from inside
there<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:23.310> after<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> bus

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
there and then after that get on the bus

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.800 
there and then after that get on the bus
you<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> bus<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> second

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you want to take the bus to the second

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.980 
you want to take the bus to the second
stop<00:00:28.279> from<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> beginning<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.330> past<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
stop from the beginning so past the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.770 
stop from the beginning so past the
diner<00:00:31.320> place<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> farm<00:00:33.090> while

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
diner place and then to the farm while

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.240 
diner place and then to the farm while
we're<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.320> glitches<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> farm

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
we're doing this glitches at the farm

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
gonna need to turbine get the turbine

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.460 
gonna need to turbine get the turbine
and<00:01:13.439> use<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> door<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.020> opens

and then go to the other door use your
turbine<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> also<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:23.250> let<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> door<00:01:23.790> open

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
turbine at it also to let that door open

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.340 
turbine at it also to let that door open
right<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.500> outside<00:01:25.710> let<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> door<00:01:26.850> shut

right you go outside let the door shut

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.630 
right you go outside let the door shut
then<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.650> use<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> turbine<00:01:29.280> again

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
then you want to use the turbine again

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.260 
then you want to use the turbine again
open<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.479> door<00:01:31.040> doors<00:01:32.040> open<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.700> window<00:01:33.030> and

open that door doors open the window and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
open that door doors open the window and
the<00:01:33.479> gates<00:01:33.750> shut<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.159> corner

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the gates shut go in the back corner

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
the gates shut go in the back corner
where<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.189> inside<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
where we are right now and inside the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.480 
where we are right now and inside the
corner<00:01:38.579> you're<00:01:38.790> invincible<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:40.369> zombies<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
corner you're invincible to zombies that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
corner you're invincible to zombies that
come<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> door<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> left<00:01:43.740> wait

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
come and by the door to the left wait

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.389 
come and by the door to the left wait
what<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.520> had<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> open<00:01:45.680> some<00:01:46.680> bees<00:01:46.860> may<00:01:47.130> come

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
what we had to open some bees may come

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.639 
what we had to open some bees may come
through<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.820> only<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:48.930> per<00:01:49.380> round

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
through that only one or two per round

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.090 
through that only one or two per round
that's<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> most<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.950> right

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
