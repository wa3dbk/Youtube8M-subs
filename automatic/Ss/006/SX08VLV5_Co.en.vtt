00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.740
 I have not seen it yet 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.540
 a few of my instagram photos i 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.399
 do as a screenshot and pull the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.229
 learn all my editing program 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.800
 on the same size and print them 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.050
 then first off my good 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.149
 old glue stick I will now that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.220
 Cover sheet from the college block complete 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.470
 coat with glue and then one 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 nice leaves go on it is like that 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.910
 a cardboard which I at tchibo in so 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 bought a ten-pack it's like that 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.450
 many different beautiful pappets and yes 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.950
 I have it on it then 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.830
 stuck around this ugly 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.229
 to rethink design and then I have 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.180
 here is a bus lane in pieces 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.280
 cut and, so to speak, two 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.810
 clothesline curious so it should open 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.549
 to look after each case later 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.439
 then I have my instagram 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.080
 Cut out the pictures and put them on a 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.910
 something bigger piece of paper because that 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.670
 Paper glued so they are easy 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.410
 look like polaroid photos and yes the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.079
 I have then just to the clothesline 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 so to speak, it glued to it 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.989
 Looks like these polaroid photos are there 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.989
 dranhängen 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.640
 [Music] 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.140
 I just have the photos 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.360
 I have helicopters labeled 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.890
 written below or new york and 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.110
 a little heart and so on 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.640
 you let your creativity run free 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.680
 and what's missing is yes 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.090
 actually clothespins but there the yes 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.310
 I'm not exactly beautiful 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.020
 decided to just flowers with 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120
 a hot glue gun exactly in the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.100
 middle of the pictures to stick so that it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.940
 as if the pictures on these flowers 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.620
 dranhängen 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.450
 and then I have space up there 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 there was a banner stuck and still there 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 written and already is ours 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.280
 college block finished and i think that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.780
 is an absolute eye-catcher 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.459
 I love so colorful planners 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.380
 or calendar and if you are 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.989
 she wants to buy a cool then cost 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.340
 the real amount of money and a lot of money 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.080
 That's why I wanted to think 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.360
 I make one myself and that was 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.310
 quite simply, I have to go first 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.620
 a nice layout so wanted 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.720
 simply the calendar should be structured 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.820
 and then I googled and up there 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.300
 entered calendar print subscription or 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.010
 calendar printable sri if you like one 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.299
 would like to have calendar like me 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.530
 that has done here now 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.269
 and then I have for such a 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.799
 colorful design decided what you are here 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.480
 but you can really see 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.769
 take everything you want there is there 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.540
 so much choice 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.370
 Then save your favorite layout 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.190
 of course, and then I'm on the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.150
 gone bank.de and then on the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.900
 button design 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.870
 then you go to custom and give 1754 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.239
 times 1240 that's the size of one 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.420
 din a4 sheet and then i open mine 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.030
 saved layout and adjust it that way 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.739
 that it is exactly halfway or one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.750
 a little less than half of the 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.340
 sheet takes because we have the sheet 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.989
 later in the half fold 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.120
 beckmann one can still do such a thing 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.610
 I insert some symbols I have her 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.290
 triangles or a heart which you like 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.750
 you want and then you save the whole 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.160
 and now comes the clou because now 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.959
 we will be the picture we are right now 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.700
 have saved just do it again 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.530
 to feel in that means we have it 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.180
 now twice in there and fit that 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.460
 now so that it is exactly on the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.010
 the other side is that we save then 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.419
 back off and print the whole thing out 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.190
 I then turned over sheet paper 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.320
 again done in the printer with it 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.240
 just the back also printed 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.790
 and so we have when we do that 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.440
 whole in 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.540
 please click ever so small 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.700
 calendar with four weeks alone 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.500
 a sheet of paper and now you can 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.480
 really print what we like 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.310
 still want to be it a timetable as 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.050
 I did this, I did 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.970
 now even thicker cardboard glued because 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.890
 we now have to create the cover from 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.360
 our calendar and here i have 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.450
 again taken such a nice cap 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.640
 from this tens pack of tchibo and there 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.040
 on it the other cardboard glued to the 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.530
 hourly schedule so that's just our cover 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.970
 looks really nice and stable 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.190
 or not just looks 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.380
 but should be stable because we will 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.400
 Now the whole thing together 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.680
 I now only talk what 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.140
 put a lot of weight on the pappers 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.120
 just stick to each other well 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.490
 and now I have the individual leaves 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.740
 put into each other like that 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.450
 Now you can see here and around the book 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.880
 I just have to finish it now 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.160
 just a rubber made a pretty big one 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.600
 and then in the middle around it 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.940
 curious as you see it here now 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.190
 we can have one under there already 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.720
 small calendar really cool and that 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.150
 We also have to look very good 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.160
 that the cover sheet really nice 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.990
 stable is because the rubber otherwise 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.550
 just pull it together then I have here 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.350
 I found another sticker like this 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.730
 glued on the front if you have something 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.440
 Of course I have you too 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.720
 print something out again and glue on it 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.520
 or something on it how he likes it 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.140
 I want you and now you can too 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.940
 have your calendar to begin 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.980
 label I have here then the first 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.540
 registered and the beautiful week 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.730
 this planner is simply that she 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.050
 completely according to your wishes 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.100
 You can not and you can not do that 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.110
 to buy 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.850
 you can now, for example, one more 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.950
 print a few to-do lists and those there 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.570
 do it clean or whatever he wants 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.830
 and I think that's right 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.830
 become a nice little book 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.090
 who does not know that one just has 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.860
 fresh new violent buys and would like 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.750
 Carefully put in the bag 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.789
 but after a few meters they are already 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.699
 somehow bent over and you have the 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.229
 look in there and donkey ears and what 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.599
 I always felt like a problem 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.879
 have is that every folder looks the same 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.590
 and I never knew which one for which 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.629
 Fach is then I have something in part 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.490
 forget or I have eternal in mine 

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:43.560
 pocket and there I have such a 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.479
 very little tip for you and indeed 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.270
 needed only paper clips and a 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.280
 some colorful ribbons or threads or something 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.469
 whatever you have at home and have there 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.139
 I then just a little grind 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:57.980
 attached to a paperclip and attached to it 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.289
 what you are good for now you will see 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.719
 [Music] 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:03.939
 I now attach with the paperclip 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.889
 all sides of the booklet like each other 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.659
 that can see here now and through it 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:10.180
 that I now such a colorful loop 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.909
 I can top it off from the top in the 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.490
 Detect bag directly for which subject 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.409
 which folder is there and I need it 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.080
 Do not look in my bag for long 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.089
 through the paperclip remain the pages 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.979
 the booklet also nicely together 

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:25.389
 that means the booklet does not link like that 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.369
 fast and of course one too 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.199
 Plus point smart is of course if you 

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:31.029
 so a little legend has it 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.219
 that you also know what color for 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:35.289
 which subject is there but I think so 

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:37.659
 just a sweet little idea like 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.619
 you can do without envelopes or something 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:43.629
 you can love her that was now the 

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:45.249
 ideas of me as you your school things 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.990
 really cool aufpimpen and if 

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:48.580
