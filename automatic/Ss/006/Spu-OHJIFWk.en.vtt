00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.170
 here they are swimming here snake corner 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.680
 red now i'm here a little under 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.880
 I feed 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.620
 so they were more active at all this 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.480
 one of the largest fish in the genus 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.450
 snakehead them a lot of different 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.550
 snakehead species 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.830
 length can reach nature up to a meter and 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.150
 more 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.490
 to keep it in an aquarium you need 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.900
 extremely large aquarium in the area 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.520
 from 300 liters from hands costs 400 liters 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.800
 so much they will feel 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.020
 more comfortable besides red 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.450
 snakehead they are considered one of the most 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.360
 the most aggressive of them are new species 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.210
 he can attack any fish including 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.980
 kindred and especially much larger 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.110
 themselves that is to them no matter if they 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.510
 hungry they can calmly attack even 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.250
 bigger fish than prey 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.620
 prey which he generally cannot 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.740
 swallow it just starts to vomit on 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.679
 pieces and does it he can even 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.490
 then when not particularly hunger and so for 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.619
 entertaining 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.200
 and he also has one of the biggest 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.380
 clubs that can not only bite 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.189
 fisherman but also you fields months if in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.529
 sunete group 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.219
 when he can snap 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:27.109
 calmly still about and they adorned 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.719
 young here are visible red poppies from them 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:33.889
 the stripes are pretty attractive 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:37.789
 it looks but as they grow 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:40.539
 turn white and turn dark blue by 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:45.770
 conditions of content requirements 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:48.249
 water temperature these snakehead such 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.249
 more 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.290
 more precisely no longer particularly demanding 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.490
 temperature from 26 to 28 degrees 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.770
 Aquarium must necessarily be with 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.200
 lid can they jump out at all in 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.270
 nature are crawling from new 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.930
 reservoirs another country near the reservoir 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.940
 is still young can be groups 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.890
 keep when they grow up better of course in 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.750
 alone because if with others 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.920
 fish keep it about the same 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.780
 the size you need is at least 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.410
 so that it is less likely that he them 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 eat you a particular predator by 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.940
 survival by age they live not 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.190
 free about 12 years old max speed is 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.290
 so about nevolin in the aquarium of course 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.640
 do you have to take care of something 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.630
 filtering is necessary operation 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.640
 partial weekly water change 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.640
 regards on feeding well they eat 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.120
 can and earthworms throw congress 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.489
 you can give and squid and shrimp here I 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.000
 they are now given here a module frozen 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.070
 live moth is also not good going young 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.970
 be sure to feed me every day not 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 a lot of adults can be less than a week 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.600
 times it would be enough when needed 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.660
 will be in adults but so in short you 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.370
 told about this hand in general took 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.250
 all the same contain and of course separately 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.850
 more often it then remains 1 cunning
