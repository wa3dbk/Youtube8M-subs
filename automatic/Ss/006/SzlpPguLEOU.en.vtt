 Thank you guys for providing this 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.860
 device 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.899
 also watch the video to the end rather 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.539
 let's talk more about this contest 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.070
 device we play out 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.309
 actually what is this thing 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.980
 This is a victorinox bike tour 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.969
 which is created for cyclists and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.060
 only for them how does the company see this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.080
 it will replace the thing accordingly 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.340
 most devices you need 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 to our cyclist there are no these accents 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 only if some tula exactly 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 multitool here is more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.970
 compact body and quite comfortable 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 to wear 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.009
 I'm in such a blister pack here 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.759
 painted five positions first 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 respectively, the holder itself is orange 2 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.009
 this trouble holder 3 key itself 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 hex and nozzles also 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:41.880
 5 pieces and these are black side dies 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.159
 called this aul developed what is it 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.780
 whether to lift you write something 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.540
 this spirit well anyway 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 additional tool 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.689
 how much I'm on a bike not hiking 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.010
 even walked us more than two hundred kilometers 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.470
 when you pass 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.540
 on my knees waited for hexagons 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.600
 may well help out fired sit down and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.870
 screwdrivers and everything let's 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.550
 Take a closer look at what you immediately liked. 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.680
 This device is missing 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.960
 Chinese analogue squeeze can be found 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.190
 similar chinese chinese crap 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.770
 dollars for dollar and accordingly 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.630
 enjoy life but that's what's like in 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.970
 Such pro more expensive products this for 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.530
 such imbalance is broken then 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.900
 there is a choice that this device and it is very 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.940
 beaten staggering nothing dangles then 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 there is not falling off I know for sure that I 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.960
 I'll throw this bag in my briefcase 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.030
 same condition and they 'll get 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.110
 to the parts that the bits are there separately on the bottom 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.600
 key separately 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.760
 and you start to collect all this in this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.220
 big plus suggested you know that everything 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.550
 so be it let's break it all down 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.450
 joy is removed so the key is lateral 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.760
 dies just move out here 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.870
 respectively 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.850
 incomprehensible device from two sides 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.310
 such as are removed 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.020
 little man the bits themselves can be squeezed out 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.660
 on the other hand they are also 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.360
 magnetized pretty cool meaning you 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.560
 brought to steel the main bit and holder 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.010
 for example , men need a big trouble my 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:25.489
 set that does not want to sit down 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.750
 which side is very tight 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.360
 magnet pretty much nothing 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.180
 staggering to shoot quite problematic 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.850
 even that is, you brought the necessary you 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.450
 nozzle put in place everything is in order 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.400
 nothing will lie somewhere lying around 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.410
 did the right thing and put it in its place 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.870
 not in this garlic approach really like 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.940
 because how much was not to beat forever not 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.569
 are lost scatter some such 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.819
 normal holder has never been 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.299
 nozzles are all sure that more than 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.519
 quality and cheap devices and I think 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.719
 here with this problem should not be 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:09.079
 about quality you can not worry the focus 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:11.299
 We catch about the quality of the metal of course 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.730
 did not speak prematurely 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.370
 This thing because I came only 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.500
 only one and you need to play it this way. 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.870
 that such a purely table review 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.389
 male tests then i think that 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.990
 test then snot nothing everyone saw 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.539
 bits 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.419
 everyone knows how this thing works 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.370
 Brian is interesting that this is Vix 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.340
 and made fixed everything pretty 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:38.180
 just put and now this is her here 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.389
 and to latch everything and it will not fall off 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.300
 nothing dangles can be easy 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.849
 it can carry and use 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.349
 handy by the way not only 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.320
 bikers I fully imagine how 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.150
 you work there for construction and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.990
 why so he can also find in this 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.270
 your interest is quite an interesting thing 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.610
 it is a pity that we are not for sale on this 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.159
 I'll order a bead when you go to 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.389
 cycling can help and 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.280
 I think that here they are all bits 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.550
 fit on an ordinary mountain bike 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.909
 which they are all using now also 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.090
 Gizmo useful if for example you like me 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.220
 there on hiking take for example with something 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.820
 me a bit nothing that's this thing she 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.180
 will finish this here this gap and not 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.650
 you need a multitool with you to take a spoon 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.229
 once again show how they are removed 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.680
 just move in or take off and for sure 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.789
 just put in place the two sides 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.300
 be sure to find out what this thing is and 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.970
 add video to the caption 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.220
 such an interesting thing write in 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.310
 comments what you think you need 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.110
 or fat furious but somehow we 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.090
 play the game pick up our group 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.800
 in contact with 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.290
 follow the link which will also be 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.669
 in the caption to the video is nothing complicated 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.630
 spend a minute of your time 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.870
 opportunity to reveal just such a thing 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:07.690
 a trifle and it's nice of you on this probably 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.690
 all stay with us see you soon
