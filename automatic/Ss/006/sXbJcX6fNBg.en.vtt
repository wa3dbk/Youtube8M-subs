00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.300 

in<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.620> gonna<00:00:01.680> take<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.979> look<00:00:02.129> at

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
in this video we're gonna take a look at

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.450 
in this video we're gonna take a look at
simplifying<00:00:02.790> integer<00:00:03.720> exponents<00:00:04.710> there's<00:00:05.370> a

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
simplifying integer exponents there's a

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
simplifying integer exponents there's a
couple<00:00:05.850> special<00:00:06.210> ones<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:06.779> when<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.049> need

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
couple special ones that when you need

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.080 
couple special ones that when you need
to<00:00:07.290> take<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> look<00:00:07.740> at<00:00:07.950> first<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.639> let's<00:00:08.820> talk

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
to take a look at first so let's talk

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.390 
to take a look at first so let's talk
about<00:00:09.420> those<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.990> then<00:00:10.559> from<00:00:10.889> there<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.370> can

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
about those and then from there we can

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.759 
about those and then from there we can
look<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:11.880> simplifying<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:13.170> we've<00:00:13.349> got<00:00:13.590> on

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
look at simplifying what we've got on

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.689 
look at simplifying what we've got on
this<00:00:13.950> page<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.179> first<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.220> that<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.520> we

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
this page the first one is that if we

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.269 
this page the first one is that if we
have<00:00:17.940> something<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> zero<00:00:19.170> power<00:00:19.470> let's

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
have something to the zero power let's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.240 
have something to the zero power let's
say<00:00:20.520> X<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> zero<00:00:21.660> power<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
say X to the zero power that is going to

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.359 
say X to the zero power that is going to
be<00:00:23.369> equal<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:24.359> because<00:00:25.350> any<00:00:25.800> number

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
be equal to one because any number

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.089 
be equal to one because any number
raised<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.720> zero<00:00:28.080> power<00:00:28.140> any<00:00:28.740> nonzero

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
raised to the zero power any nonzero

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.299 
raised to the zero power any nonzero
number<00:00:29.670> raised<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.570> zero<00:00:30.869> power<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.500> going

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
number raised to the zero power is going

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.400 
number raised to the zero power is going
to<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.550> equal<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.910> one<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.690> by

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to be equal to one and that's by

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
to be equal to one and that's by
definition<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.940> second<00:00:36.510> thing<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.809> we're

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
definition the second thing that we're

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.389 
definition the second thing that we're
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
going to look at is if we have a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
going to look at is if we have a
negative<00:00:38.820> power<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.620> X<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
negative power so if we have X to the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
negative power so if we have X to the
negative<00:00:41.969> n<00:00:42.210> power<00:00:42.629> that's<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> be

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
negative n power that's going to be

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
negative n power that's going to be
equal<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:45.450> over<00:00:45.719> X<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> N<00:00:47.700> power<00:00:48.149> okay

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
equal to one over X to the N power okay

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.319 
equal to one over X to the N power okay
so<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.860> rid<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.309> negative<00:00:50.730> power

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
so to get rid of that negative power

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.650 
so to get rid of that negative power
what<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.559> flip<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.280> X<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
what we do is we flip the X down to the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
what we do is we flip the X down to the
denominator<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.730> take<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.180> that

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
denominator and then we take it to that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
denominator and then we take it to that
positive<00:00:57.690> power

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
positive power

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.000 
positive power
okay<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.789> let's<00:01:00.120> apply<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.620> look<00:01:01.890> at

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
okay so let's apply that as we look at

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
okay so let's apply that as we look at
these<00:01:02.129> six<00:01:02.550> examples<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.960> first<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.439> right

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
these six examples the first one right

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.850 
these six examples the first one right
up<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.600> we've<00:01:06.600> got<00:01:06.869> T<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> negative

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
up here we've got T to the negative

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.910 
up here we've got T to the negative
fourth<00:01:08.430> power<00:01:08.810> okay<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.530> rid<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
fourth power okay so to get rid of that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.200 
fourth power okay so to get rid of that
negative<00:01:11.340> fourth<00:01:11.640> power

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
negative fourth power

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840 
negative fourth power
one<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.439> key<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.549> we're

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
one thing that's key is that as we're

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.200 
one thing that's key is that as we're
simplifying<00:01:15.330> these<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.070> simplified<00:01:17.939> if

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
simplifying these it's not simplified if

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.940 
simplifying these it's not simplified if
there's<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> negative<00:01:18.780> power<00:01:19.259> there<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.830> we

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
there's a negative power there so we

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.730 
there's a negative power there so we
have<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> take<00:01:20.610> care<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> those<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.500> one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have to take care of those so this one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
have to take care of those so this one
that<00:01:23.159> negative<00:01:23.670> fourth<00:01:23.970> power<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.840> rid<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that negative fourth power to get rid of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
that negative fourth power to get rid of
it<00:01:25.259> I'm<00:01:25.710> just<00:01:25.950> gonna<00:01:26.130> flip<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> bottom

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it I'm just gonna flip it to the bottom

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200 
it I'm just gonna flip it to the bottom
so<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.750> 1<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.590> T<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> fourth

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
so it's gonna be 1 over T to the fourth

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.469 
so it's gonna be 1 over T to the fourth
power<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:31.110> positive<00:01:31.920> fourth<00:01:32.280> power<00:01:32.579> okay

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
power that's positive fourth power okay

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.440 
power that's positive fourth power okay
how<00:01:34.200> about<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.909> 3

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
how about this one right here we have 3

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710 
how about this one right here we have 3
R<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> negative<00:01:37.650> fifth<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> one

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
R to the negative fifth now for this one

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
R to the negative fifth now for this one
it's<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.380> important<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.070> we're<00:01:41.460> aware

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's really important that we're aware

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530 
it's really important that we're aware
of<00:01:42.320> what<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.649> negative<00:01:44.490> fifth<00:01:45.000> power<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of what that negative fifth power is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
of what that negative fifth power is
being<00:01:45.840> applied<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> only<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
being applied to the only thing it's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.990 
being applied to the only thing it's
being<00:01:48.930> applied<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> case<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> R

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
being applied to in this case is the R

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.630 
being applied to in this case is the R
so<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> R<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> only<00:01:52.860> thing<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> will<00:01:53.520> get

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
so the R is the only thing that will get

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
so the R is the only thing that will get
flipped<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> bottom<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.290> be

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
flipped to the bottom so this will be

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.990 
flipped to the bottom so this will be
three<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.189> R<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> fifth<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:59.000> sometimes

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
three over R to the fifth now sometimes

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
three over R to the fifth now sometimes
people<00:02:00.149> will<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.659> confused<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.619> they'll

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
people will get confused and they'll

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.730 
people will get confused and they'll
think<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> 3<00:02:02.549> goes<00:02:02.790> down<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.450> well<00:02:04.290> what

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
think the 3 goes down with it well what

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.770 
think the 3 goes down with it well what
that<00:02:04.979> would<00:02:05.310> be<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.240> had<00:02:06.479> this

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
that would be is if we had this

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.160 
that would be is if we had this
situation<00:02:07.550> where<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.580> had<00:02:08.910> 3<00:02:09.330> R<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:10.050> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
situation where we had 3 R to the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.680 
situation where we had 3 R to the
negative<00:02:10.590> fifth<00:02:10.830> power<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.360> would

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
negative fifth power then that would

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
negative fifth power then that would
give<00:02:12.930> us

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
give us

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.200 
give us
one<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.200> we'd<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.560> take

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
one over and then we'd have to take

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.470 
one over and then we'd have to take
three<00:02:18.210> our<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:19.530> whole<00:02:19.830> thing<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.210> fifth

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
three our that whole thing to the fifth

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.660 
three our that whole thing to the fifth
power<00:02:21.720> okay<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.550> careful<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> be<00:02:25.230> aware<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
power okay so be careful and be aware of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
power okay so be careful and be aware of
exactly<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.120> power<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.780> being<00:02:28.020> applied

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
exactly what that power is being applied

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.190 
exactly what that power is being applied
to<00:02:28.880> all<00:02:29.880> right<00:02:30.090> let's<00:02:30.330> go<00:02:30.480> back<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
to all right let's go back up here and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.550 
to all right let's go back up here and
take<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.440> look<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:33.180> has<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:36.510> has

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
take a look at this one it has it has

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.340 
take a look at this one it has it has
two<00:02:37.700> times<00:02:38.700> X<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> negative<00:02:39.570> third<00:02:40.050> power

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
two times X to the negative third power

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
two times X to the negative third power
times<00:02:41.090> y<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.600> negative<00:02:42.780> second<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.800> then

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
times y to the negative second and then

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.270 
times y to the negative second and then
that's<00:02:44.580> over<00:02:44.940> Z<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.420> fourth<00:02:45.840> well<00:02:46.290> again

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that's over Z to the fourth well again

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.000 
that's over Z to the fourth well again
this<00:02:48.000> X<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.840> being<00:02:49.020> taken<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.560> negative

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this X is being taken to the negative

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.740 
this X is being taken to the negative
third<00:02:50.280> power<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:50.910> know<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.270> got<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.660> get

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
third power so I know that's got to get

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.500 
third power so I know that's got to get
flipped<00:02:52.080> down<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.280> Y<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.580> being<00:02:54.060> taken<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.450> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
flipped down the Y is being taken to the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
flipped down the Y is being taken to the
negative<00:02:54.930> second<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.740> got<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.070> get

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
negative second I know that's got to get

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.310 
negative second I know that's got to get
flipped<00:02:56.490> down<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.450> let's<00:02:57.630> go<00:02:57.810> ahead<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.200> do

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
flipped down so let's go ahead and do

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.520 
flipped down so let's go ahead and do
that<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.800> what's<00:02:59.100> left<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.640> top<00:02:59.940> well<00:03:00.390> two<00:03:01.230> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that so what's left on top well two is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.170 
that so what's left on top well two is
left<00:03:01.830> on<00:03:02.040> top<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.580> that's<00:03:02.850> sitting<00:03:03.150> there

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
left on top because that's sitting there

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.080 
left on top because that's sitting there
by<00:03:03.450> itself<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.950> bottom<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.670> end<00:03:05.850> up

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
by itself then on the bottom we end up

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.370 
by itself then on the bottom we end up
with<00:03:06.390> X<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> third<00:03:08.330> Y<00:03:09.330> squared<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.230> I'm

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
with X to the third Y squared and I'm

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.980 
with X to the third Y squared and I'm
just<00:03:10.530> doing<00:03:10.800> an<00:03:10.860> alphabetical<00:03:11.490> here<00:03:11.760> Z<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.960> the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
just doing an alphabetical here Z to the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.040 
just doing an alphabetical here Z to the
fourth<00:03:13.470> okay<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.000> can't<00:03:15.300> simplify<00:03:15.720> any

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
fourth okay and I can't simplify any

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.870 
fourth okay and I can't simplify any
further<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.650> we've<00:03:16.980> got<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:17.250> different

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
further because we've got all different

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.290 
further because we've got all different
variables<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.340> stop<00:03:20.580> all

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
variables there so we have to stop all

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.240 
variables there so we have to stop all
right<00:03:21.480> now<00:03:21.780> let's<00:03:22.230> look<00:03:22.320> at<00:03:22.530> this<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:22.950> who

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
right now let's look at this one who

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640 
right now let's look at this one who
looks<00:03:24.000> kind<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.330> crazy<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.870> scary<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
looks kind of crazy and scary but I

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
looks kind of crazy and scary but I
think<00:03:26.010> we<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.310> handle<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.760> let's<00:03:26.970> take<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> look

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
think we can handle it let's take a look

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.990 
think we can handle it let's take a look
at<00:03:27.600> what<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:27.870> have<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.440> one<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.760> notice

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
at what we have here one thing to notice

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.380 
at what we have here one thing to notice
is<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:31.530> piece<00:03:31.980> right<00:03:32.400> here<00:03:32.459> notice<00:03:33.120> we

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
is that this piece right here notice we

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.720 
is that this piece right here notice we
have<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.630> negative<00:03:34.110> three<00:03:34.470> over<00:03:34.709> negative<00:03:35.040> 6

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
have the negative three over negative 6

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.229 
have the negative three over negative 6
that<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.140> simplify<00:03:37.590> just<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.550> if<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.060> was

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that we can simplify just like if it was

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.510 
that we can simplify just like if it was
sitting<00:03:39.480> here<00:03:39.750> by<00:03:39.959> itself<00:03:40.170> negative<00:03:41.130> three

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
sitting here by itself negative three

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.040 
sitting here by itself negative three
over<00:03:41.820> negative<00:03:42.239> six

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
over negative six

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.840 
over negative six
well<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.830> would<00:03:43.980> simplify<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.580> just

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
well that would simplify to just

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.990 
well that would simplify to just
positive<00:03:45.810> one<00:03:46.170> half<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.400> I'm<00:03:47.459> gonna<00:03:47.580> start

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
positive one half so I'm gonna start

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.020 
positive one half so I'm gonna start
with<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:49.440> gonna<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.890> 1<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.730> top

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
with that I'm gonna have a 1 on the top

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
with that I'm gonna have a 1 on the top
and<00:03:51.810> two<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.730> bottom<00:03:53.959> that<00:03:54.959> took<00:03:55.290> care<00:03:55.500> of

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and two on the bottom that took care of

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.670 
and two on the bottom that took care of
these<00:03:55.830> things<00:03:56.220> then<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.450> G<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.170> negative

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
these things then this G to the negative

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.560 
these things then this G to the negative
second<00:03:59.280> that's<00:03:59.580> got<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.880> get<00:04:00.000> flipped<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
second that's got to get flipped to the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.630 
second that's got to get flipped to the
bottom<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.200> I'm<00:04:01.260> gonna<00:04:01.380> have<00:04:01.530> G<00:04:01.890> squared<00:04:02.400> on

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
bottom so I'm gonna have G squared on

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.620 
bottom so I'm gonna have G squared on
the<00:04:02.670> bottom<00:04:03.140> then<00:04:04.140> I've<00:04:04.290> got<00:04:04.530> an<00:04:04.680> H<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.520> top<00:04:05.630> and

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
the bottom then I've got an H on top and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.870 
the bottom then I've got an H on top and
an<00:04:07.560> H<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.190> 0<00:04:08.820> on<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.239> bottom<00:04:09.680> hmm<00:04:10.739> oh<00:04:10.890> yeah

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
an H to the 0 on the bottom hmm oh yeah

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.300 
an H to the 0 on the bottom hmm oh yeah
that's<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.480> anything<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> 0<00:04:13.830> power<00:04:13.920> is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
that's right anything to the 0 power is

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.390 
that's right anything to the 0 power is
just<00:04:14.670> 1<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.750> that<00:04:15.900> would<00:04:16.080> just<00:04:16.109> be<00:04:16.380> 1<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:19.400> 2

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
just 1 so that would just be 1 and 2

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.620 
just 1 so that would just be 1 and 2
times<00:04:20.730> 1<00:04:21.120> right<00:04:21.810> there<00:04:22.080> would<00:04:22.350> just<00:04:22.620> be<00:04:22.770> 2<00:04:23.039> so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
times 1 right there would just be 2 so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.180 
times 1 right there would just be 2 so
we're<00:04:24.630> good<00:04:24.840> there<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.470> I'm<00:04:25.560> just<00:04:25.710> gonna<00:04:25.860> leave

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
we're good there so I'm just gonna leave

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.780 
we're good there so I'm just gonna leave
that<00:04:26.220> H<00:04:26.700> set<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.270> on<00:04:27.390> top

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
that H set there on top

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.300 
that H set there on top
and<00:04:27.880> then<00:04:28.450> finally<00:04:28.900> we've<00:04:29.050> got<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.530> K<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:29.980> the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and then finally we've got the K to the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.580 
and then finally we've got the K to the
negative<00:04:30.790> second<00:04:31.270> well<00:04:31.540> that's<00:04:32.200> got<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.440> get

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
negative second well that's got to get

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.200 
negative second well that's got to get
flipped<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.010> bottom<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:33.700> have<00:04:33.880> K

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
flipped to the bottom so we have K

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.110 
flipped to the bottom so we have K
squared<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.920> could<00:04:36.130> rewrite<00:04:36.550> that<00:04:36.610> if<00:04:36.940> I'd

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
squared so I could rewrite that if I'd

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.800 
squared so I could rewrite that if I'd
like<00:04:37.360> because<00:04:38.110> one<00:04:38.590> times<00:04:38.920> H<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.640> H<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.600> H

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
like because one times H is just H so H

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.690 
like because one times H is just H so H
over<00:04:41.350> 2<00:04:42.240> G<00:04:43.240> squared<00:04:43.890> K<00:04:44.890> squared<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.790> that's<00:04:46.660> it

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
over 2 G squared K squared and that's it

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.220 
over 2 G squared K squared and that's it
now<00:04:48.700> let's<00:04:48.730> take<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.270> look<00:04:49.480> at<00:04:49.600> this<00:04:49.780> one<00:04:50.020> all

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
now let's take a look at this one all

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.100 
now let's take a look at this one all
right<00:04:51.160> we've<00:04:51.370> got<00:04:51.400> K<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.390> negative<00:04:52.780> fourth

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
right we've got K to the negative fourth

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.730 
right we've got K to the negative fourth
over<00:04:53.590> 2<00:04:53.920> I<00:04:54.370> need<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.450> flip<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:56.080> down<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.620> the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
over 2 I need to flip that down to the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.920 
over 2 I need to flip that down to the
bottom<00:04:56.950> so<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:57.610> gonna<00:04:57.760> become<00:04:58.920> K<00:04:59.920> 2<00:05:00.700> times<00:05:01.270> K

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
bottom so it's gonna become K 2 times K

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.040 
bottom so it's gonna become K 2 times K
to<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.260> fourth<00:05:02.410> on<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.280> bottom<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:04.720> what<00:05:04.900> is

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
to the fourth on the bottom but what is

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.340 
to the fourth on the bottom but what is
there<00:05:05.290> on<00:05:05.440> top<00:05:05.820> well<00:05:06.820> there's<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.660> 1<00:05:07.960> sitting

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
there on top well there's a 1 sitting

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.950 
there on top well there's a 1 sitting
there<00:05:08.650> okay<00:05:09.100> in<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.700> same<00:05:10.000> way<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.540> here

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
there okay in the same way that here

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.710 
there okay in the same way that here
when<00:05:11.110> we<00:05:11.290> had<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:12.280> T<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.120> negative<00:05:13.450> fourth

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
when we had the T to the negative fourth

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.390 
when we had the T to the negative fourth
we<00:05:13.900> flipped<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.320> down<00:05:14.530> where<00:05:14.740> they<00:05:14.800> had<00:05:14.950> a<00:05:14.980> 1<00:05:15.220> on

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
we flipped it down where they had a 1 on

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.430 
we flipped it down where they had a 1 on
top<00:05:15.670> save<00:05:16.630> big<00:05:16.930> opai's<00:05:17.260> here<00:05:19.440> sometimes

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
top save big opai's here sometimes

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.110 
top save big opai's here sometimes
people<00:05:20.890> get<00:05:21.010> confused<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.730> they<00:05:21.820> want<00:05:22.030> to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
people get confused and they want to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.630 
people get confused and they want to
push<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.540> back<00:05:22.750> up<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.230> top<00:05:23.440> no<00:05:24.160> no<00:05:24.460> we

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
push that back up to the top no no we

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.530 
push that back up to the top no no we
can't<00:05:24.910> do<00:05:25.090> that

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
can't do that

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.330 
can't do that
remember<00:05:26.320> it's<00:05:26.590> getting<00:05:26.890> flipped<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.280> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
remember it's getting flipped to the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
remember it's getting flipped to the
bottom<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:28.060> it's<00:05:28.240> 1<00:05:28.660> over<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:30.210> amount<00:05:31.210> right

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
bottom so it's 1 over that amount right

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.140 
bottom so it's 1 over that amount right
there<00:05:32.010> all<00:05:33.010> right<00:05:33.190> how<00:05:33.520> about<00:05:33.550> this<00:05:33.880> one<00:05:34.120> right

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
there all right how about this one right

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.110 
there all right how about this one right
here<00:05:34.660> we<00:05:35.260> have<00:05:35.380> R<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.860> 6th<00:05:36.580> well<00:05:36.820> that's

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
here we have R to the 6th well that's

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.930 
here we have R to the 6th well that's
just<00:05:37.420> positive<00:05:37.810> so<00:05:38.260> we're<00:05:38.410> good<00:05:38.680> there<00:05:39.010> T<00:05:39.790> to

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
just positive so we're good there T to

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.690 
just positive so we're good there T to
the<00:05:40.060> 0<00:05:40.450> well<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.050> would<00:05:41.170> just<00:05:41.200> be<00:05:41.500> 1<00:05:41.800> 1<00:05:42.340> times

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
the 0 well that would just be 1 1 times

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.970 
the 0 well that would just be 1 1 times
R<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.150> 6th<00:05:43.570> is<00:05:43.690> still<00:05:43.930> R<00:05:44.170> to<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.350> 6th<00:05:44.860> and

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
R to the 6th is still R to the 6th and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.850 
R to the 6th is still R to the 6th and
then<00:05:45.580> we<00:05:45.700> have<00:05:45.940> s<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.720> the<00:05:46.840> negative<00:05:47.230> 2nd<00:05:47.740> on

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
then we have s to the negative 2nd on

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.160 
then we have s to the negative 2nd on
the<00:05:48.040> bottom<00:05:48.640> well<00:05:49.300> that's<00:05:49.450> gonna<00:05:49.600> get<00:05:49.810> flipped

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
the bottom well that's gonna get flipped

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.680 
the bottom well that's gonna get flipped
to<00:05:50.320> the<00:05:50.440> top<00:05:50.770> so<00:05:51.220> I'm<00:05:51.280> gonna<00:05:51.400> have<00:05:51.640> s<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:52.420> the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
to the top so I'm gonna have s to the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.980 
to the top so I'm gonna have s to the
second<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.670> then<00:05:54.670> well<00:05:55.270> what's<00:05:55.510> left<00:05:55.600> on<00:05:55.960> the

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
second and then well what's left on the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.700 
second and then well what's left on the
bottom<00:05:57.600> nothing<00:05:58.600> it<00:05:58.720> would<00:05:58.810> just<00:05:58.990> be<00:05:59.080> over<00:05:59.110> 1

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
bottom nothing it would just be over 1

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.400 
bottom nothing it would just be over 1
and<00:06:00.010> of<00:06:00.490> course<00:06:00.730> we<00:06:00.910> can<00:06:01.090> simplify<00:06:01.480> that<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:01.960> R

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and of course we can simplify that to R

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.170 
and of course we can simplify that to R
to<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.800> 6th<00:06:03.520> s<00:06:04.260> to<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.410> 2nd<00:06:05.920> so<00:06:06.520> we<00:06:06.640> don't<00:06:06.820> we

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
to the 6th s to the 2nd so we don't we

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.540 
to the 6th s to the 2nd so we don't we
can<00:06:07.300> get<00:06:07.450> rid<00:06:07.600> of<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:07.840> divided<00:06:08.260> by<00:06:08.380> 1<00:06:08.800> so

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
can get rid of that divided by 1 so

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.750 
can get rid of that divided by 1 so
simplifying<00:06:10.390> integer<00:06:10.930> exponents<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:12.460> keys

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
simplifying integer exponents the keys

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.020 
simplifying integer exponents the keys
are<00:06:13.180> remembering<00:06:13.810> that<00:06:14.310> anything<00:06:15.310> to<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.610> 0

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
are remembering that anything to the 0

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.860 
are remembering that anything to the 0
power<00:06:16.120> is<00:06:16.690> defined<00:06:17.530> as<00:06:17.770> 1<00:06:18.130> and<00:06:18.490> to<00:06:19.420> get<00:06:19.600> rid<00:06:19.750> of

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
power is defined as 1 and to get rid of

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.400 
power is defined as 1 and to get rid of
those<00:06:19.960> negative<00:06:20.350> powers<00:06:21.190> we<00:06:21.910> have<00:06:21.940> to<00:06:22.450> flip

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
those negative powers we have to flip

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.000 
those negative powers we have to flip
that<00:06:24.340> value<00:06:24.940> down<00:06:25.150> if<00:06:25.510> it's<00:06:25.870> on<00:06:26.170> the<00:06:26.440> top<00:06:26.680> it

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
that value down if it's on the top it

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.310 
that value down if it's on the top it
goes<00:06:27.190> down<00:06:27.430> to<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.760> denominator<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.570> fence<00:06:29.140> on

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
goes down to the denominator it fence on

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.200 
goes down to the denominator it fence on
the<00:06:29.500> bottom<00:06:29.920> like<00:06:30.280> we<00:06:30.310> saw<00:06:30.640> in<00:06:30.790> this<00:06:30.910> last

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
the bottom like we saw in this last

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.770 
the bottom like we saw in this last
example<00:06:31.450> it<00:06:32.170> gets<00:06:32.440> flipped<00:06:32.830> up<00:06:33.040> to<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.340> top

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
example it gets flipped up to the top

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.050 
example it gets flipped up to the top
also<00:06:34.780> remember<00:06:35.290> if<00:06:35.890> every

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
also remember if every

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.909 
also remember if every
eeeek<00:06:39.310> if<00:06:40.310> everything<00:06:41.000> is<00:06:41.210> gone<00:06:42.169> from<00:06:42.620> on<00:06:42.800> the

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
eeeek if everything is gone from on the

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.740 
eeeek if everything is gone from on the
top<00:06:43.160> there's<00:06:43.550> always<00:06:43.730> a<00:06:43.880> one<00:06:44.180> up<00:06:44.360> there

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
top there's always a one up there

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.540 
top there's always a one up there
don't<00:06:44.960> try<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.230> push<00:06:45.530> the<00:06:45.740> things<00:06:45.980> back<00:06:46.280> up

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
don't try and push the things back up

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.159 
don't try and push the things back up
and<00:06:47.080> also<00:06:48.100> remember<00:06:49.600> that<00:06:50.600> that<00:06:50.840> negative

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:51.169 
and also remember that that negative

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.750 
and also remember that that negative
situation<00:06:52.160> let's<00:06:52.790> say<00:06:52.880> that<00:06:53.240> we<00:06:53.780> have

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
situation let's say that we have

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.360 
situation let's say that we have
something<00:06:55.760> like<00:06:55.970> this

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
something like this

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.930 
something like this
negative<00:06:58.370> five<00:06:59.740> to<00:07:00.740> the<00:07:00.770> negative<00:07:01.430> third

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
negative five to the negative third

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.520 
negative five to the negative third
power<00:07:03.340> okay<00:07:04.340> in<00:07:04.550> that<00:07:04.850> situation<00:07:05.720> we<00:07:06.380> would

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
power okay in that situation we would

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.870 
power okay in that situation we would
flip<00:07:07.010> it<00:07:07.190> down

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880 
flip it down

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.080 
flip it down
so<00:07:08.000> we'd<00:07:08.150> have<00:07:08.180> one<00:07:08.780> over<00:07:09.440> and<00:07:09.710> this<00:07:10.610> negative

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
so we'd have one over and this negative

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.600 
so we'd have one over and this negative
is<00:07:11.690> still<00:07:11.720> the<00:07:12.320> case<00:07:12.590> we'd<00:07:13.010> have<00:07:13.070> negative

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
is still the case we'd have negative

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.710 
is still the case we'd have negative
five<00:07:14.380> to<00:07:15.380> the<00:07:15.410> positive<00:07:16.250> third<00:07:16.610> power<00:07:16.910> okay

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
five to the positive third power okay

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.120 
five to the positive third power okay
the<00:07:18.110> sign<00:07:18.500> changes<00:07:19.430> on<00:07:19.729> the<00:07:20.360> exponent<00:07:21.139> only<00:07:21.650> be

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
the sign changes on the exponent only be

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.760 
the sign changes on the exponent only be
really<00:07:22.490> careful<00:07:22.970> with<00:07:23.120> that<00:07:23.300> as<00:07:23.540> well<00:07:23.840> so<00:07:24.500> then

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
really careful with that as well so then

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.640 
really careful with that as well so then
we<00:07:24.919> could<00:07:25.100> simplify<00:07:25.460> this<00:07:25.840> negative<00:07:26.840> 5<00:07:27.290> times

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
we could simplify this negative 5 times

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.250 
we could simplify this negative 5 times
negative<00:07:27.860> 5<00:07:28.130> would<00:07:28.430> be<00:07:28.490> 20<00:07:28.970> 5<00:07:29.150> times<00:07:29.960> negative

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
negative 5 would be 20 5 times negative

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.640 
negative 5 would be 20 5 times negative
5<00:07:30.530> would<00:07:30.979> be<00:07:31.040> negative<00:07:31.750> 125<00:07:32.750> so<00:07:33.139> it'll<00:07:33.260> be<00:07:33.380> 1

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:33.650 
5 would be negative 125 so it'll be 1

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.990 
5 would be negative 125 so it'll be 1
over<00:07:33.860> negative<00:07:34.840> 125<00:07:35.840> so<00:07:36.800> hope<00:07:37.669> this<00:07:37.850> was

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
over negative 125 so hope this was

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.980 
over negative 125 so hope this was
