00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.329
 I want to speak a little respect to the commercial representative of the farma channel 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.859
 Whenever we talk about it 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.640
 is in the pharmacy market of the pharmaceutical market in general speaking 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.130
 much of the industry figure 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.249
 of the consumer pharmacy distributor 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.599
 but I really like a figure where it shows the commercial representative and 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.109
 exactly in the center 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.890
 you have a link that the industry after the distributor the sales representative 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.060
 next pharmacy 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.510
 and consumers the commercial representative in our area in our life 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 way of looking at the way we see 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.090
 he needs 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.240
 and deserve 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.750
 1 special highlight 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.310
 the representative takes the image of both the industry and the debtors together 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.480
 to pharmacies 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.850
 and it is very important in my view that it is very important that it be a link 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.230
 of this current, it can not be the weak link in the chain 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.410
 What have we done? I've been studying and working with 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.440
 commercial representatives also from 94 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.950
 we develop 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.810
 a content that is the business representative with a business consultant 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.690
 it's a very different posture 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.810
 of the common commercial representative 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.360
 in models that we know the commercial representative as a 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.740
 business consultant he has a bit more information 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.530
 he has a little more knowledge looks have three levels of knowledge 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.799
 that it delve deeper knowledge of product market knowledge and 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.210
 knowledge about his client's business from the pharmacy 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.979
 there is a phrase that I really like what the customer says tends to trust 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.700
 more 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.050
 yes, who tends your business 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.710
 then the commercial representative as a business consultant beyond him more 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.420
 his client's business 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.930
 pharmacy that he can make more contributions and what it means 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.280
 understand more of the business 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 his client's pharmacy 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 means understanding more of your needs 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.369
 then what is the raw material of a business consultant? 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.560
 if you are a sales representative you should be asking 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 What do I agree with? 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.099
 my client will respect but I understand his business more 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.629
 the raw material of the business consultant 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 the raw material of a business consultant and knowledge 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.099
 team and will rely heavily on the knowledge you think about 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.399
 of business 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.239
 It is important for your client to have a little more information 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.809
 about it is important that you get evolved a little more if 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.290
 improve a little more 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.599
 search information 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.569
 and we have to recompose 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.590
 I decided to present as a business consultant a method 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.419
 it's a working method 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.489
 is presumed 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.359
 In two major pillars the method assumes the following 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.539
 relationship 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.240
 and work and knowledge 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.760
 on the side of the personal relationship that commercial relationship 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.939
 make gay mass with physical person but do business of legal person 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.849
 it's important both 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.219
 in the course that we get involved the more we help run 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.410
 to differentiate these two things 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.600
 and the knowledge side 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.000
 knowledge about your customer has knowledge about the business 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.770
 there are two other pillars of the other 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.139
 the representative who will 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.380
 He is a species of the zimba. He is a species. 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.790
 deco creator 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030
 have knowledge 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.669
 in the theme of the relationship here has 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.520
 he has some 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.219
 some topics that are very important that we are profound 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.139
 if you are quickly here 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.859
 frequency confidence sequence and comes 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.720
 many people do not understand right that that frequency sequence 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.229
 offers 29 240 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.519
 much more advanced is already a state 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.230
 the stage of supremacy 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.070
 in the relation but the idea of ​​frequency in sequence is very 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.999
 interesting 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.270
 and to the extent that more in-depth knowledge 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.979
 you will advance more 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.380
 is expanding relationship can not leave her knowledge right 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.839
 it is very important you know the needs of the preferences 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:15.049
 We approach this quite deeply. 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.280
 the commercial representative course as a business consultant 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.180
 is also available in two ways the availability is in person 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.540
 we can do it 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.390
 along with distributors as is also available the mainz you 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.440
 It could be that course when you want it to be in the comfort of your home. 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.199
 at a very reasonable cost 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.520
 and I'm sure you'll love this first one that deals with 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.840
 fundamentals 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.660
 we will still have two modules in the future 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.570
 is module 2 of module three that are already being prepared but will come more 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.509
 forward 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.009
 for now are the good fundamentals
