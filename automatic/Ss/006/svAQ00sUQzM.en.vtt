leveraged to other parts of the world we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.020 
leveraged to other parts of the world we
decided<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:33.530> initiative<00:00:34.430> should<00:00:34.760> really

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030

have distinction from other programs and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.620 
have distinction from other programs and
that's<00:00:38.960> why<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:39.649> started<00:00:39.980> off<00:00:40.190> with<00:00:40.630> programs

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
that's why we started off with programs

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.110 
that's why we started off with programs
that<00:00:41.900> will<00:00:42.050> bring<00:00:42.290> not<00:00:42.980> only<00:00:43.010> doctors<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:44.000> the

manner so that's what our global health
initiative<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.430> about<00:01:10.579> I<00:01:11.030> think<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.570> creates

initiative is about I think it creates

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.080 
initiative is about I think it creates
tremendous<00:01:13.450> opportunity<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.799> understand<00:01:15.799> how

that globally the spread of disease is

that globally the spread of disease is
very<00:02:19.040> very<00:02:20.500> rampant<00:02:21.500> look<00:02:22.040> at<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> recent<00:02:22.790> our

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
very very rampant look at the recent our

very very rampant look at the recent our

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
h1n1 look at this as epidemic and it's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.460 
h1n1 look at this as epidemic and it's
increasingly<00:02:27.950> clear<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.990> we're<00:02:29.990> not<00:02:30.260> as

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
increasingly clear that we're not as

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.010 
increasingly clear that we're not as

isolated from the spread of all these

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.820 
isolated from the spread of all these
diseases<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:34.420> that's<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.600> reason<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.260> access

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830

and I said yeah this is what happens all

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.520 
and I said yeah this is what happens all
over<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.550> world<00:04:10.760> right<00:04:11.390> when<00:04:11.780> doctors<00:04:12.500> are

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
over the world right when doctors are

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.520 
over the world right when doctors are
practicing<00:04:13.400> without<00:04:13.910> all<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.510> resources<00:04:15.050> and

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
practicing without all the resources and

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.180 
practicing without all the resources and
so<00:04:15.860> what<00:04:16.190> we<00:04:16.340> need<00:04:16.520> to<00:04:16.549> do<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.540> learn

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
so what we need to do is to learn

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.640 
so what we need to do is to learn
resource-poor<00:04:18.880> settings<00:04:18.989> what<00:04:19.989> we<00:04:20.110> can<00:04:20.350> do

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
resource-poor settings what we can do

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.100 
resource-poor settings what we can do
and<00:04:20.980> then<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.370> technology<00:04:22.060> can<00:04:22.300> help<00:04:22.540> us<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and then what technology can help us and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.650 
and then what technology can help us and
I<00:04:23.260> bet<00:04:23.560> he's<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.250> gonna<00:04:24.640> be<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> same<00:04:25.180> doctor

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
I bet he's not gonna be the same doctor

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.750 
I bet he's not gonna be the same doctor
ever<00:04:25.990> again<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.950> he<00:04:27.280> had<00:04:27.520> that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
ever again because he had that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.480 
ever again because he had that
experience<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.660> strategy<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.620> we've<00:04:29.800> adopted

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
experience a strategy that we've adopted

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.180 
experience a strategy that we've adopted
is<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.860> create<00:04:33.090> strategic<00:04:34.090> partnerships<00:04:34.840> with
