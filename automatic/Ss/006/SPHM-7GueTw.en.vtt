fits has been set too far back now if
you<00:00:23.080> look<00:00:23.380> you'll<00:00:23.710> see<00:00:23.800> all<00:00:24.220> this<00:00:24.369> crap<00:00:24.430> here

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
you look you'll see all this crap here

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.150 
you look you'll see all this crap here
all<00:00:26.439> around<00:00:26.830> here<00:00:27.150> give<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:28.330> much<00:00:28.509> longer

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
all around here give that much longer

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.380 
all around here give that much longer
you<00:00:30.160> would<00:00:30.340> have<00:00:30.430> plugged<00:00:30.640> this<00:00:30.850> thing<00:00:31.150> up

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
you would have plugged this thing up

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.420 
you would have plugged this thing up
what<00:00:31.960> was<00:00:32.080> happening<00:00:32.710> is<00:00:32.830> the<00:00:32.949> oil<00:00:33.160> was

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
what was happening is the oil was

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.350 
what was happening is the oil was
impinging<00:00:34.120> upon<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.629> head<00:00:35.970> probably<00:00:36.970> caused

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
impinging upon this head probably caused

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.960 
impinging upon this head probably caused
some<00:00:37.840> soot<00:00:38.110> formation<00:00:38.890> or<00:00:39.370> maybe<00:00:39.699> some

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
some soot formation or maybe some

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.869 
some soot formation or maybe some
unburned<00:00:40.449> fuel<00:00:40.920> something<00:00:41.920> like<00:00:42.129> that<00:00:42.430> maybe

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
unburned fuel something like that maybe

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.939 
unburned fuel something like that maybe
the<00:00:43.059> reason<00:00:43.330> this<00:00:43.390> thing<00:00:43.629> was<00:00:43.780> taken<00:00:44.110> out<00:00:44.260> I'm

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
the reason this thing was taken out I'm

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.610 
the reason this thing was taken out I'm
going<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.250> get<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.580> gauge<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.479> show<00:00:47.170> where<00:00:47.470> it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
going to get the gauge to show where it

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.979 
going to get the gauge to show where it
should<00:00:47.920> be<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.879> I'll<00:00:49.030> show<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.300> how<00:00:49.479> far<00:00:49.780> off

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
should be and I'll show you how far off

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.090 
should be and I'll show you how far off
it<00:00:50.199> was<00:00:51.809> okay<00:00:52.809> Beckett<00:00:53.260> makes<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.739> little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
it was okay Beckett makes this little

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.780 
it was okay Beckett makes this little
funky<00:00:54.489> tool<00:00:54.900> t5o<00:00:55.900> one<00:00:56.379> thing<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:57.159> good<00:00:57.580> for<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
funky tool t5o one thing it's good for a

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.640 
funky tool t5o one thing it's good for a
whole<00:00:57.850> bunch<00:00:58.059> of<00:00:58.239> stuff<00:00:58.540> but<00:00:58.809> one<00:00:59.470> of<00:00:59.500> the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
whole bunch of stuff but one of the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.740 
whole bunch of stuff but one of the
things<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.070> good<00:01:00.339> for<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:01.000> determining<00:01:01.720> the

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
things it's good for is determining the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.280 
things it's good for is determining the
depth<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.350> nozzle<00:01:02.769> should<00:01:02.799> be<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.780> gun<00:01:05.049> line

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
depth of nozzle should be the gun line

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.219 
depth of nozzle should be the gun line
should<00:01:05.530> be<00:01:05.770> or<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.979> gun<00:01:06.220> should<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:08.049> put

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
should be or the gun should be you put

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.890 
should be or the gun should be you put
it<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.440> there<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:08.619> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it in there like that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.740 
it in there like that
and<00:01:11.280> we'll<00:01:12.280> see<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.700> get<00:01:12.880> close<00:01:13.210> enough<00:01:13.450> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.810 

okay<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:20.020> looks<00:01:20.380> like<00:01:20.500> it's<00:01:20.859> about<00:01:21.039> it's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
okay it looks like it's about it's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.330 
okay it looks like it's about it's
actually<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.450> little<00:01:23.350> lot<00:01:23.590> farther<00:01:24.009> than<00:01:24.189> it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
actually a little lot farther than it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.300 
actually a little lot farther than it
looks<00:01:24.729> but<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.240> about<00:01:25.799> 3/16<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.920> an<00:01:27.130> inch

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
looks but it's about 3/16 of an inch

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.289 
looks but it's about 3/16 of an inch
away

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
away

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.539 
away
it<00:01:29.229> looks<00:01:29.439> closer<00:01:29.710> than<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.070> but<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.399> really

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
it looks closer than that but it really

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.380 
it looks closer than that but it really
isn't<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.659> too<00:01:34.899> far<00:01:35.140> back<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.579> I'll

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
isn't and it's too far back and I'll

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.480 
isn't and it's too far back and I'll
show<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.719> how<00:01:38.020> we<00:01:38.079> can<00:01:38.320> adjust<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.950> thing<00:01:39.310> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
show you how we can adjust that thing to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.450 
show you how we can adjust that thing to
get<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:39.789> right

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.600 

if<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.700> find<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.450> adjustment<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.610> the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
if you find that the adjustment on the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:58.120 
if you find that the adjustment on the
the<00:01:47.540> depth<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:49.240> gun<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:52.070> incorrect<00:01:57.130> this

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
the depth of that gun is incorrect this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.969 
the depth of that gun is incorrect this
is<00:01:58.369> an<00:01:58.490> adjustment<00:01:58.970> right<00:01:59.299> here<00:01:59.780> that<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.799> can

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
is an adjustment right here that you can

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.840 
is an adjustment right here that you can
use<00:02:01.340> to<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:03.500> move<00:02:03.740> this<00:02:03.979> back<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.429> forth<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
use to to move this back and forth you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.060 
use to to move this back and forth you
just<00:02:05.030> loosen<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.780> looseness<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.860> this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
just loosen this and looseness now this

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.490 
just loosen this and looseness now this
one<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:07.729> also<00:02:08.450> has<00:02:08.660> another<00:02:08.989> one<00:02:09.229> right

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
one here also has another one right

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.640 
one here also has another one right
there

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.949 

this<00:02:12.650> one's<00:02:12.890> blanked<00:02:13.489> off<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.660> burner

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
this one's blanked off on this burner

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.780 
this one's blanked off on this burner
but<00:02:15.319> it's<00:02:15.470> another<00:02:15.769> one<00:02:16.010> sometimes<00:02:16.459> they<00:02:16.610> look

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
but it's another one sometimes they look

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.360 
but it's another one sometimes they look
just<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.299> but<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.410> loosen<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.069> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
just like that but you loosen that and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
just like that but you loosen that and
you<00:02:19.670> loosen<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> thumb<00:02:21.260> wheel<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:23.239> can

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
you loosen the thumb wheel and you can

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.460 
you loosen the thumb wheel and you can
move<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> forth

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
move it back and forth

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.650 
move it back and forth
now<00:02:24.650> obviously<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.549> burner<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.209> going<00:02:26.510> to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
now obviously the burner is going to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.009 
now obviously the burner is going to
have<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.140> be<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.760> furnace<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.780> any

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
have to be out of the furnace to do any

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.630 
have to be out of the furnace to do any
of<00:02:30.049> this<00:02:30.230> stuff<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.739> pretty<00:02:31.069> much<00:02:31.190> can't<00:02:31.489> get

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
of this stuff you pretty much can't get

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.930 
of this stuff you pretty much can't get
in<00:02:31.790> there<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.090> most<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.569> them<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:34.370> check<00:02:34.670> this

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
in there on most of them to check this
