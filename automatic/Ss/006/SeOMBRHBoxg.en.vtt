about 50% of patients have GERD now why

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.189 
about 50% of patients have GERD now why
well<00:00:37.550> there<00:00:37.969> are<00:00:38.030> several<00:00:38.329> causes<00:00:38.690> like

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
well there are several causes like

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.380 
well there are several causes like
increased<00:00:39.739> intra-abdominal<00:00:40.219> pressure<00:00:40.760> there

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
increased intra-abdominal pressure there

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.930 
increased intra-abdominal pressure there
they<00:00:41.780> may<00:00:41.930> be<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.109> hiatal<00:00:42.829> hernia<00:00:43.219> associated

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
they may be a hiatal hernia associated

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.599 
they may be a hiatal hernia associated
that's<00:00:44.120> causing<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:44.600> heartburn<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.140> reflux

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
that's causing the heartburn the reflux

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.040 
that's causing the heartburn the reflux
there<00:00:46.609> may<00:00:46.789> be<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.969> low<00:00:47.210> tone<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.870> lower

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
there may be a low tone of the lower

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.670 
there may be a low tone of the lower
esophageal<00:00:48.590> sphincter<00:00:49.329> there<00:00:50.329> are<00:00:50.480> these<00:00:51.379> are

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
esophageal sphincter there are these are

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.590 
esophageal sphincter there are these are
mainly<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.340> main<00:00:52.460> causes<00:00:53.000> here<00:00:53.149> now<00:00:53.300> when<00:00:53.480> we

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
mainly the main causes here now when we

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.209 
mainly the main causes here now when we
talk<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:53.840> increased<00:00:54.530> into<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.920> inter

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
talk about increased into the inter

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.759 
talk about increased into the inter
abdominal<00:00:55.579> pressure<00:00:55.789> here<00:00:56.239> think<00:00:56.870> as<00:00:57.079> if<00:00:57.320> you

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
abdominal pressure here think as if you

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.729 
abdominal pressure here think as if you
had<00:00:58.010> 10<00:00:58.820> bricks<00:00:59.179> on<00:00:59.510> your<00:00:59.570> abdomen<00:01:00.410> while

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
had 10 bricks on your abdomen while

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.400 
had 10 bricks on your abdomen while
you're<00:01:00.859> laying<00:01:01.039> down<00:01:01.250> this<00:01:01.730> will<00:01:01.940> cause

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
you're laying down this will cause

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.430 
you're laying down this will cause
pressure<00:01:03.410> on<00:01:03.679> your<00:01:03.859> abdominal<00:01:04.370> wall<00:01:04.550> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
pressure on your abdominal wall and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.140 
pressure on your abdominal wall and
increase<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.590> intrumental<00:01:07.160> tension<00:01:07.610> causing

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
increase the intrumental tension causing

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.620 
increase the intrumental tension causing
the<00:01:08.660> heartburn<00:01:09.200> or<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:09.620> reflux<00:01:10.010> here<00:01:10.630> as

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the heartburn or the reflux here as

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.840 
the heartburn or the reflux here as
patients<00:01:12.230> lose<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.680> weight<00:01:12.860> after<00:01:13.130> surgery

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
patients lose the weight after surgery

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.230 
patients lose the weight after surgery
this<00:01:14.450> pressure<00:01:14.890> in<00:01:15.890> your<00:01:16.220> abdomen<00:01:16.670> starts<00:01:17.120> to

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
this pressure in your abdomen starts to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.210 
this pressure in your abdomen starts to
lower<00:01:17.420> because<00:01:17.900> those<00:01:18.110> bricks<00:01:18.500> start<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.010> come

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
lower because those bricks start to come

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.830 
lower because those bricks start to come
off<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.700> weight<00:01:19.850> starts<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.300> come<00:01:20.450> off<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.720> it

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
off the weight starts to come off and it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.610 
off the weight starts to come off and it
gets<00:01:21.320> better<00:01:22.240> now<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:23.450> we<00:01:23.960> go<00:01:24.110> into<00:01:24.260> surgery

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
gets better now if we go into surgery

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.470 
gets better now if we go into surgery
and<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:24.980> find<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.310> hiatal<00:01:25.670> hernia<00:01:25.970> which<00:01:26.210> this

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
and we find a hiatal hernia which this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.960 
and we find a hiatal hernia which this
occurs<00:01:27.080> in<00:01:27.230> about<00:01:27.320> 15%<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.490> patients

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
occurs in about 15% of the patients

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.090 
occurs in about 15% of the patients
having<00:01:29.150> weight<00:01:29.420> loss<00:01:29.450> surgery<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:30.710> fixed<00:01:31.010> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
having weight loss surgery we fixed the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.980 
having weight loss surgery we fixed the
hiatal<00:01:31.430> hernia<00:01:31.760> we<00:01:32.270> fixed<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.600> at<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.810> same

hiatal hernia we fixed it at the same
time<00:01:33.230> we<00:01:33.380> do<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.620> sleeve<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.220> correct<00:01:34.550> the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
time we do the sleeve to correct the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.110 
time we do the sleeve to correct the
anatomical<00:01:35.420> condition<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.680> have<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.370> video<00:01:37.760> on

more on this condition now there is a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.010 
more on this condition now there is a
strong<00:01:48.620> association<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:50.000> reflux<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
strong association of reflux and the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.830 
strong association of reflux and the
gastric<00:01:51.290> sleeve<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.550> truly<00:01:52.850> believe<00:01:53.000> truly

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
gastric sleeve but I truly believe truly

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.890 
gastric sleeve but I truly believe truly
believe<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.820> it<00:01:55.820> has<00:01:55.970> been<00:01:56.150> documented<00:01:56.660> and

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
believe that it has been documented and

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.840 
believe that it has been documented and
studied<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.500> a<00:01:57.530> good<00:01:57.830> technique<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.670> good

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
studied that a good technique a good

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.840 
studied that a good technique a good
surgical<00:01:59.270> technique<00:01:59.980> is<00:02:00.980> fundamental<00:02:01.700> on

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
surgical technique is fundamental on

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.960 
surgical technique is fundamental on
helping<00:02:02.240> or<00:02:03.200> eliminating<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.980> reflux<00:02:04.370> also<00:02:04.910> I

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
helping or eliminating the reflux also I

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.970 
helping or eliminating the reflux also I
need<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.300> say<00:02:05.480> that<00:02:05.720> in<00:02:05.900> Korea<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.530> increased

need to say that in Korea the increased

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.940 
need to say that in Korea the increased
internal<00:02:07.460> pressure<00:02:07.820> causes<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.899> reflux<00:02:09.319> in

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
internal pressure causes the reflux in

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.009 
internal pressure causes the reflux in
some<00:02:10.280> patients<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.849> first<00:02:11.030> few<00:02:11.269> weeks<00:02:11.420> two

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
some patients the first few weeks two

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.990 
some patients the first few weeks two
months<00:02:12.260> after<00:02:12.409> surgery<00:02:12.739> now<00:02:13.159> some<00:02:13.489> patients

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
months after surgery now some patients

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.600 
months after surgery now some patients
may<00:02:14.719> need<00:02:14.900> some<00:02:15.170> acid<00:02:15.560> blockers<00:02:15.950> during<00:02:16.189> this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
may need some acid blockers during this

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.800 
may need some acid blockers during this
okay<00:02:17.830> normally<00:02:18.830> what<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.190> see<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.730> that

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
okay normally what we see is that

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.240 
okay normally what we see is that
patients<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:20.930> have<00:02:21.260> heartburn<00:02:21.620> or<00:02:21.890> reflux

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
patients that have heartburn or reflux

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.310 
patients that have heartburn or reflux
before<00:02:22.670> surgery<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.300> likely<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.870> continue

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
before surgery are likely to continue

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.590 
before surgery are likely to continue
with<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.620> some<00:02:25.460> patients<00:02:25.910> that<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.240> never

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
with it some patients that have never

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.170 
with it some patients that have never
had<00:02:26.870> GERD<00:02:27.440> may<00:02:27.950> experience<00:02:28.430> some<00:02:28.790> after

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
had GERD may experience some after

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.420 
had GERD may experience some after
surgery<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.890> opposite

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
surgery and then we have the opposite

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.760 
surgery and then we have the opposite
where<00:02:31.610> patients<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.900> have<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> history<00:02:33.500> of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
where patients that have a history of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.220 
where patients that have a history of
GERD<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.940> condition<00:02:35.390> gets<00:02:35.600> better<00:02:35.900> after

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
GERD the condition gets better after

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.490 
GERD the condition gets better after
surgery<00:02:36.650> specifically<00:02:37.280> especially<00:02:38.230> when<00:02:39.230> a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
surgery specifically especially when a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.970 
surgery specifically especially when a
good<00:02:39.800> surgical<00:02:40.310> technique<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.790> applied<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
good surgical technique is applied so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.830 
good surgical technique is applied so
