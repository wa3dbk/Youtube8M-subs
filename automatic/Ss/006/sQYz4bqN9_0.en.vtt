bit of rust this one's already been
cleaned<00:01:57.289> up<00:01:57.409> by<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.619> way<00:01:57.800> all<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.429> them<00:01:58.550> have

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
cleaned up by the way all of them have

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.399 
cleaned up by the way all of them have
been<00:01:58.850> cleaned<00:01:59.119> up<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.509> know<00:01:59.810> they<00:02:00.080> don't<00:02:00.200> look

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
been cleaned up I know they don't look

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.499 
been cleaned up I know they don't look
like<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.830> but<00:02:01.009> they<00:02:01.490> were<00:02:01.549> really<00:02:01.880> really<00:02:02.119> bad

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
like it but they were really really bad

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.679 
like it but they were really really bad
I<00:02:02.780> put<00:02:03.350> engine<00:02:03.649> degreaser<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.490> hosed<00:02:05.329> them<00:02:05.540> off

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
I put engine degreaser I hosed them off

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.020 
I put engine degreaser I hosed them off
with<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.020> power<00:02:06.229> hose<00:02:06.610> trying<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:07.820> most

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
with the power hose trying to get most

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.030 
with the power hose trying to get most
of<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.269> junk<00:02:08.600> off<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.869> him<00:02:09.200> but<00:02:09.649> there's<00:02:09.860> still

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
of the junk off of him but there's still

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.370 
of the junk off of him but there's still
stuff<00:02:10.190> coming<00:02:10.670> off<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.850> them<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.959> know<00:02:12.079> as<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
stuff coming off of them you know as you

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.180 
stuff coming off of them you know as you
as<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:14.709> darting<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.769> little<00:02:15.980> bit<00:02:16.070> of

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
as you can see darting a little bit of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.250 
as you can see darting a little bit of
rust<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.810> things<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.850> but<00:02:19.850> uh

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
rust and and things like that but uh

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.949 
rust and and things like that but uh
maybe<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.410> close<00:02:21.650> up<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.190> see<00:02:22.400> a

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
maybe if I close up you could see a

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.949 
maybe if I close up you could see a
little<00:02:23.959> more<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.160> detail<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.930> I

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
little more of the detail and like I

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.360 
little more of the detail and like I
said<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.230> cleaned<00:02:27.500> them<00:02:27.590> up<00:02:27.739> with<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.070> stuff

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
said I cleaned them up with that stuff

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.960 
said I cleaned them up with that stuff
that's<00:02:28.489> just<00:02:28.700> falling<00:02:29.060> off<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
that's just falling off and and but you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
get it I've been using penetrating oil

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.459

and<00:03:28.060> things<00:03:28.209> like<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:29.639> but<00:03:31.019> yeah<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.260> video

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
and things like that but yeah the video

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:34.140 
and things like that but yeah the video
doesn't<00:03:32.799> give<00:03:33.040> justice<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> how<00:03:33.670> much<00:03:33.790> crud

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
doesn't give justice to how much crud

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.209 
doesn't give justice to how much crud
and<00:03:34.329> crop<00:03:34.689> is<00:03:34.989> in<00:03:35.139> there<00:03:35.319> but<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> guess<00:03:36.159> a

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.219 
and crop is in there but I guess a

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.209 
and crop is in there but I guess a
close-up<00:03:36.700> kind<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.150> does<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:38.010> they've<00:03:39.010> kind

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
close-up kind of does and they've kind

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.129 
close-up kind of does and they've kind
of<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.340> lot<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.519> rust<00:03:39.730> issues<00:03:39.939> and<00:03:40.749> things<00:03:41.019> like

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
of a lot of rust issues and things like

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.129 
of a lot of rust issues and things like
that<00:03:41.439> on<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.939> just<00:03:43.060> some<00:03:43.329> surface<00:03:43.870> rust

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
that on but it's just some surface rust

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.259 
that on but it's just some surface rust
you<00:03:44.409> know<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.829> not<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:45.639> not<00:03:45.760> bad<00:03:46.000> at<00:03:46.180> all

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
you know it's not it's not bad at all

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.619 
you know it's not it's not bad at all
stuff<00:03:47.139> that<00:03:47.169> I<00:03:47.290> can<00:03:47.530> handle<00:03:47.919> and<00:03:48.359> once<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.449> get

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
stuff that I can handle and once I get

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.470 
stuff that I can handle and once I get
these<00:03:49.750> tubs<00:03:52.709> restored<00:03:53.790> or<00:03:54.790> washing<00:03:55.030> machines

these tubs restored or washing machines

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.539 
these tubs restored or washing machines
I<00:03:56.409> think<00:03:56.650> they're<00:03:56.769> gonna<00:03:56.859> look<00:03:57.010> really<00:03:57.219> really

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
I think they're gonna look really really

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.390 
I think they're gonna look really really
nice<00:03:57.750> all<00:03:58.750> right<00:03:58.810> well<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.469> should<00:03:59.949> have<00:04:00.219> done<00:04:00.340> a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
nice all right well I should have done a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.209 
nice all right well I should have done a
before<00:04:00.579> video<00:04:01.269> before<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:02.019> point<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.099> show

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
before video before this point to show

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.209 
before video before this point to show
you<00:04:03.280> how<00:04:03.459> bad<00:04:03.909> they<00:04:04.120> really<00:04:04.449> were<00:04:04.659> but<00:04:05.099> this<00:04:06.099> is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.219 
you how bad they really were but this is

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.509 
you how bad they really were but this is
there<00:04:06.370> nothing<00:04:06.849> in<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.159> getting<00:04:09.430> them

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
there nothing in and it's getting them

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.580 
there nothing in and it's getting them
running<00:04:09.699> that<00:04:09.969> that<00:04:10.209> that<00:04:10.599> counts<00:04:11.079> first<00:04:11.319> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
running that that that counts first and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.129 
running that that that counts first and
then<00:04:11.739> now<00:04:11.919> I<00:04:12.219> could<00:04:12.400> want<00:04:12.609> to<00:04:13.049> making<00:04:14.049> them

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
then now I could want to making them

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:20.190 
then now I could want to making them
look<00:04:14.290> uh<00:04:14.669> you<00:04:15.669> know<00:04:16.709> pretty<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.829> stuff
