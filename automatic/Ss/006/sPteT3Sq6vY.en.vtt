00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.240
 whoever paints knows masking tape 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.580
 you use to tape the edges 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.960
 trust to make for my purposes but 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.129
 the pity is that those lines never 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.770
 become completely tight 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.890
 a bit wrinkled now there is 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.260
 flat tape and for tape has a paint 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.140
 block and with that you would be super tight 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.620
 get lines but this will cost one 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 ten 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.050
 so we are curious how tight is tight 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.040
 what 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.839
 we painted the two pieces of wall 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.429
 and now we are going to take the tape off and 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.600
 See if it is indeed very tight 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.920
 line is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 you should not leave that tape too long 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.119
 because if you do that for way too long 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 let it sit then you hardly keep it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.070
 more to wonder if you pull it, and paint 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.070
 you should do it with caution 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.700
 the breeding t 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.630
 the ordinary tape we see difference one 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.000
 bit a bit here you see anyway 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.340
 less that the paint runs underneath but 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 herr and der sache still pieces where 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.400
 it happened here it happens a bit more often 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.260
 but yes it is also a bit 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.940
 you need this wall is ribbed surface 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.350
 so once taken 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.070
 and we already have one on this surface 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:06.870
 tried but that we now say god 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.870
 once did not know that but something 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.700
 were not very impressed with it 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.069
 that frog tape 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.430
 so I went looking again and me 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.060
 found another one on the site in america 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.620
 instruction video 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 handy there was that your little pieces 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.900
 must always use because 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.880
 otherwise you stretch the tape and then it becomes 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.340
 the effect less 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.930
 and you have to press it well with a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.930
 flat object 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.100
 so that we will go again now 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.090
 try again with the regular tape and 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.090
 of course with the pro 2 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.270
 I see a little difference 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.070
 these lines are slightly tighter 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.080
 a bit fatter 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.790
 but good if you are pressed well 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.730
 he also pretty pretty 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.300
 and this roll 50 meters for less than 3 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.130
 euro and that frog tape almost a decade 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.780
 for 40 meters 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.020
 well then you can calculate what from me 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.400
 you think the price or that is more important 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.400
 very little difference
