around from the left outside guy because

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
around from the left outside guy because

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that sometimes can drift on you if you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
that sometimes can drift on you if you
throw<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.149> kind<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.420> rough<00:01:45.600> in

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
throw it and it can be kind of rough in

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
backed off coverage what we're gonna do

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
backed off coverage what we're gonna do
is<00:01:51.270> we're<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.479> wait<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.930> purple<00:01:52.170> zone

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
is we're gonna wait for that purple zone

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780 
is we're gonna wait for that purple zone
to<00:01:52.409> suck<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> should<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.490> just

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
to suck down and that should be just

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.920 
to suck down and that should be just
about<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:54.479> time<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> our

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
about at the same time that our

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.240 
about at the same time that our

some<00:02:04.920> gameplay<00:02:05.340> footage<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> played<00:02:06.149> from

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
some gameplay footage that I played from

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
some gameplay footage that I played from
my<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:07.140> online<00:02:07.409> game<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.879> ran<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> play

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
my first online game and we ran the play

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.820 
my first online game and we ran the play
pretty<00:02:09.599> heavily<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.140> game<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.649> we

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
pretty heavily in this game and we

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.170 
pretty heavily in this game and we
ultimately<00:02:11.039> ended<00:02:11.430> up<00:02:11.700> putting<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.030> like

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
ultimately ended up putting up like

ultimately ended up putting up like
50-something<00:02:12.599> points

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
50-something points

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.350 
50-something points

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
that just works great I'm not too often

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.789 
that just works great I'm not too often
did<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.390> actually<00:02:39.599> end<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:39.989> running<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.440> with

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
did I actually end up running this with

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.170 
did I actually end up running this with
pressed<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.220> coverage<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.849> had<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
pressed up coverage because I had the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.449 
pressed up coverage because I had the
whole<00:02:42.360> scheme<00:02:42.690> at<00:02:42.840> my<00:02:42.930> disposal<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.980> was

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
whole scheme at my disposal so I was

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.650 
whole scheme at my disposal so I was
using<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> other<00:02:44.940> plays<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.420> scheme

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
using the other plays in the scheme

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.910 
using the other plays in the scheme
against<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.380> know<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> press<00:02:46.739> up
