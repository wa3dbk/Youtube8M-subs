something it's very inexpensive that you
can<00:00:08.760> use<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.639> test<00:00:11.639> strips<00:00:12.000> which

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
can use they are test strips which

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.839 
can use they are test strips which
measure<00:00:13.080> 6<00:00:13.590> tests<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.580> from<00:00:14.820> a

available at most aquarium shops you

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.460 
available at most aquarium shops you
don't<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> lot<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.699> mixing<00:00:21.240> of

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
don't have to do a lot of mixing of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.230 
don't have to do a lot of mixing of
reagents<00:00:22.470> or<00:00:22.560> chemicals<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.609> tests

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
reagents or chemicals to do these tests

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.410 
reagents or chemicals to do these tests
and<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:26.000> great<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.240> just

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and it's it's great if you're just

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
and it's it's great if you're just
keeping<00:00:27.599> fish<00:00:28.199> maybe<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.160> much<00:00:29.220> corals

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
keeping fish maybe not so much corals

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.130 
keeping fish maybe not so much corals
because<00:00:29.970> corals<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> look<00:00:30.840> at<00:00:31.019> other

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
because corals you want to look at other

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
because corals you want to look at other
parameters<00:00:31.700> but<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> these<00:00:33.300> test

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
parameters but you have these test

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.830 
parameters but you have these test
strips<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.040> dip<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
strips that you actually dip into the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
strips that you actually dip into the
water<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.700> hold<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> water<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.629> 10

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
water and hold it in the water for 10

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.770 
water and hold it in the water for 10
seconds<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> pull<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.820> hold

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
seconds and then you pull them out hold

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.049 
seconds and then you pull them out hold
it<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:45.329> compare<00:00:46.850> inside<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it like this and you compare inside you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
it like this and you compare inside you
have<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.129> different<00:00:50.520> comparisons<00:00:52.309> one

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
have have your different comparisons one

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
have have your different comparisons one
is<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.640> nitrates<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:55.140> other<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.530> your

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is your nitrates the other is your

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
is your nitrates the other is your
nitrites<00:00:56.309> they'll<00:00:57.180> give<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> rough

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
nitrites they'll give you a rough

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.520 
nitrites they'll give you a rough
reading<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> measure<00:01:00.239> your

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
reading on that also a measure your

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
reading on that also a measure your
alkalinity<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.550> saltwater<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.660> pH

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
alkalinity of your saltwater and your pH

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
alkalinity of your saltwater and your pH
of<00:01:04.049> your<00:01:04.379> saltwater<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
of your saltwater so you want to make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
of your saltwater so you want to make
sure<00:01:06.119> you're<00:01:06.390> holding<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.290> strip<00:01:08.130> says

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
sure you're holding the the strip says

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
sure you're holding the the strip says
it<00:01:08.610> according<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> instructions<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
it according to the instructions and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.760 
it according to the instructions and
it's<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.790> very<00:01:12.180> general<00:01:12.840> indicator<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
it's just a very general indicator of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
it's just a very general indicator of
your<00:01:14.540> water<00:01:15.540> parameters<00:01:16.130> besides

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
your water parameters besides

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
your water parameters besides
temperature<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> salinity<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.439> want

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
temperature and salinity that you want

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
temperature and salinity that you want
to<00:01:19.710> pay<00:01:19.830> attention<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.700> you're<00:01:20.880> again<00:01:21.210> if

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to pay attention to if you're again if

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.190 
to pay attention to if you're again if
you're<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.759> raising<00:01:23.759> corals<00:01:24.450> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you're if if you are raising corals you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
you're if if you are raising corals you
want<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.920> bit<00:01:26.220> more<00:01:26.400> particular

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
want to be a little bit more particular

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
want to be a little bit more particular
and<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:30.119> want<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:32.210> actually<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> more

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and you want to actually have a more

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.800 
and you want to actually have a more
accurate<00:01:34.590> test<00:01:35.189> kit<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.759> has<00:01:35.790> reagents<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
accurate test kit that has reagents and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.179 
accurate test kit that has reagents and
you<00:01:36.960> mix<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> take<00:01:37.829> water<00:01:38.070> samples

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you mix them and you take water samples

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.569 
you mix them and you take water samples
i'm<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> show<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.689> quickly<00:01:39.780> how

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
i'm going to show you very quickly how

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.179 
i'm going to show you very quickly how
to<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:43.200> basically<00:01:43.409> take<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.950> test

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
to do it you basically take your test

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.550 
to do it you basically take your test
strip<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.360> hold<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> water<00:01:46.110> for

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
strip you just hold it in the water for

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.990 
strip you just hold it in the water for
about<00:01:46.649> 10<00:01:47.009> seconds<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:49.490> then<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> actually

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
about 10 seconds and then you actually

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.289 
about 10 seconds and then you actually
take<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> off<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.590> compare<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
take it off you compare it to your the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
take it off you compare it to your the
chart<00:01:54.600> now<00:01:55.530> again<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.490> very

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
chart now again that it's not very

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
chart now again that it's not very
accurate<00:01:57.210> reading<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.170> rough<00:01:58.439> enough

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
accurate reading but it's rough enough

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.840 
accurate reading but it's rough enough
that<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:02:00.350> know<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.530> something's<00:02:01.979> major

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that you can know if something's major

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.600 
that you can know if something's major
or<00:02:03.210> minor<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.719> happening<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.350> your<00:02:04.469> tank<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.580 

the<00:02:08.610> ball<00:02:08.820> ready<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.240> pull<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.410> would

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the ball ready to pull out now you would

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.730 
the ball ready to pull out now you would
pull<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:18.020> do<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.260> light<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
pull it out and do the light it's a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.020 
pull it out and do the light it's a
little<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.040> difficult<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.550> read<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
little bit difficult to read but you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.690 
little bit difficult to read but you
basically<00:02:21.420> compare<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:23.370> colors

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
basically compare it to the the colors

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.460 
basically compare it to the the colors
to<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.030> measurement<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.870> chart<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:27.470> you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
to the measurement on your chart and you

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.500 
to the measurement on your chart and you
just<00:02:28.680> do<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> comparison<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.910> read<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
just do a comparison and you read it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
just do a comparison and you read it
yourself<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.100> parameters<00:02:32.310> here<00:02:32.880> look

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
yourself so all the parameters here look

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.050 
yourself so all the parameters here look
pretty<00:02:33.360> good<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:36.180> nitrates<00:02:36.690> are<00:02:37.790> within<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
pretty good my nitrates are within the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.000 
pretty good my nitrates are within the
okay<00:02:39.390> range<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> lower<00:02:40.200> end<00:02:40.440> my<00:02:40.800> night

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
okay range at the lower end my night

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
okay range at the lower end my night
rights<00:02:41.370> are<00:02:42.050> extremely<00:02:43.050> safe<00:02:43.400> then<00:02:44.400> there's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
rights are extremely safe then there's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.260 
rights are extremely safe then there's
two<00:02:45.180> bars<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:47.270> saltwater

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
two bars that are not for saltwater

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.180 
two bars that are not for saltwater
measurement<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.380> middle<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
measurement in the middle and then the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.510 
measurement in the middle and then the
last<00:02:50.340> two<00:02:50.580> bars<00:02:51.230> one<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.380> ideal<00:02:52.800> that's<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
last two bars one is ideal that's the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.970 
last two bars one is ideal that's the
measure<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:53.970> alkalinity<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.780> then<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.590> ph

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
measure for alkalinity and then the ph

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.970 
measure for alkalinity and then the ph
is<00:02:56.250> pretty<00:02:57.180> much<00:02:57.390> ideal<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.050> well<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.830> look

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
is pretty much ideal as well if you look

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
is pretty much ideal as well if you look
at<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.220> color<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.880> hard<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> get<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.570> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
at the color it's hard to get it on the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.810 
at the color it's hard to get it on the
camera<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.110> that's<00:03:01.920> how<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.160> take<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
camera but that's how you take the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.670 
camera but that's how you take the
measurement<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.450> that's<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.320> simple

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
measurement and that's just a simple

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.410 
measurement and that's just a simple
water<00:03:04.920> test<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.640> can<00:03:05.820> do<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.000> this

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
water test that you can do with this

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.530 
water test that you can do with this
product<00:03:09.260> which<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.440> finds<00:03:10.740> very<00:03:11.040> handy<00:03:11.550> again

you want to have a proper test kit which

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.600 
you want to have a proper test kit which
costs<00:03:15.690> much<00:03:15.900> more<00:03:15.930> money<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:17.280> while<00:03:17.459> you're
