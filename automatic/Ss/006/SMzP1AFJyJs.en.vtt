00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
reasons why I got this pact that whistle

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.150 
reasons why I got this pact that whistle
is<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:01.120> brilliant<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:04.950> let's<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.100> look

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
is just brilliant so let's have a look

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.950 
is just brilliant so let's have a look
in<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> cab

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
in the cab

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.400 
in the cab
now<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:09.250> unsure<00:03:09.850> about<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.660> textures<00:03:11.140> in<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
now I'm unsure about the textures in the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.770 
now I'm unsure about the textures in the
manner<00:03:11.650> because<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.640> probably<00:03:13.210> more<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.660> do

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
manner because it's probably more to do

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.180 
manner because it's probably more to do
with<00:03:13.900> my<00:03:14.080> computer<00:03:14.470> than<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.520> actual<00:03:15.670> engine

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
with my computer than the actual engine

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.470 
with my computer than the actual engine
that's<00:03:18.190> why<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.400> text<00:03:18.820> is<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.090> look<00:03:19.240> a<00:03:19.330> bit

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
that's why the text is to look a bit

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.290 
that's why the text is to look a bit
naff<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:21.160> no<00:03:21.280> matter<00:03:21.460> when<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:21.880> get<00:03:22.120> my<00:03:22.270> new

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.730 
naff but no matter when I get my new

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
put the handbrake on the engine while we

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.100 
put the handbrake on the engine while we
suck<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.780> vacuum<00:03:51.690> even<00:03:52.690> though<00:03:52.780> there<00:03:52.960> is

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110

full vacuum already apparently in

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.170 
full vacuum already apparently in
railworks<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.250> doesn't<00:03:57.490> matter<00:03:57.670> whether<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
railworks it doesn't matter whether the
