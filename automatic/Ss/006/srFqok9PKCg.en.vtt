that one out bill fully it will stop

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.820 
that one out bill fully it will stop
after<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.390> starts<00:00:30.689> siren<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:31.650> for

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
after it starts siren it now then for

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.660 
after it starts siren it now then for
the<00:00:31.890> crafting<00:00:32.250> table<00:00:32.420> to<00:00:33.420> make<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:34.670> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the crafting table to make these you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
the crafting table to make these you
want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> go<00:00:36.239> inger<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> middle

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
want to get a go inger in the middle

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.750 
want to get a go inger in the middle
there<00:00:37.969> I<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.750> round<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> outside<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
there I and round the outside and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.060 
there I and round the outside and
redstone<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.719> side<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.890> make<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
redstone on the side there to make a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459 
redstone on the side there to make a
sensor<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> sensor<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> put<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
sensor now with the sensor you put that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
sensor now with the sensor you put that
there<00:00:46.910> redstone<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:53.570> bam<00:00:55.250> golly<00:00:56.250> there's<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there redstone and bam golly there's the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
there redstone and bam golly there's the
siren<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.140> how<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> very

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
siren so that's how to make the very

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.970 
siren so that's how to make the very
basic<00:00:59.309> items<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.449> sensors<00:01:01.320> obviously<00:01:01.800> do

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
basic items the sensors obviously do

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
basic items the sensors obviously do
their<00:01:02.160> job<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.579> detect<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.719> siren<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
their job and detect and the siren is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
their job and detect and the siren is
the<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.890> gives<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.450> noise<00:01:06.600> if

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the one that gives them the the noise if

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
the one that gives them the the noise if
the<00:01:06.990> centers<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.740> around<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> siren<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the centers on around the siren it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.469 
the centers on around the siren it
doesn't<00:01:09.030> work<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.420> vice<00:01:09.600> versa<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:11.479> there's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
doesn't work and vice versa so there's

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.289 
doesn't work and vice versa so there's
also<00:01:12.689> another<00:01:13.080> part<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.430> mod<00:01:14.640> which

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
also another part of the the mod which

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.030 
also another part of the the mod which
is<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:15.990> weapons<00:01:16.470> down<00:01:16.799> here

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
is all of these weapons down here

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.039 
is all of these weapons down here
there's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> tornado<00:01:17.549> gun<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.299> worm<00:01:18.540> gun<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
there's a tornado gun the worm gun the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.780 
there's a tornado gun the worm gun the
shock<00:01:19.320> wave<00:01:19.530> height<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> drill<00:01:20.280> item<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
shock wave height of the drill item and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
shock wave height of the drill item and
the<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> crashes<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> test<00:01:22.500> i<00:01:22.710> am<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the one that crashes it the test i am so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.130 
the one that crashes it the test i am so
i'm<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.360> however

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
i'm not going to use that one however

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
i'm not going to use that one however
just<00:01:25.229> moving<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.100> stuff<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.549> tornado

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
just moving all this stuff up tornado

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.170 
just moving all this stuff up tornado
gun<00:01:27.720> shockwave<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:30.170> need<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> drill<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.180> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gun shockwave i need a drill and the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
gun shockwave i need a drill and the
well<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.020> basically<00:01:34.439> at<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.770> moon<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
well that's basically at the moon and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.010 
well that's basically at the moon and
the<00:01:35.130> worm<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.670> i<00:01:35.729> guess<00:01:35.909> ok<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.810> then

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the worm going i guess ok so then

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080 
the worm going i guess ok so then
starting<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> worm<00:01:38.430> gun<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
starting off with the worm gun just to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
starting off with the worm gun just to
demonstrate<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.590> basically<00:01:41.040> fires<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.610> these

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
demonstrate it basically fires all these

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.230 
demonstrate it basically fires all these
things<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> can't<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.939> now<00:01:44.970> for

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
things that you can't see right now for

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.490 
things that you can't see right now for
some<00:01:45.360> reason<00:01:45.509> we're<00:01:46.049> basically<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.470> just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
some reason we're basically they just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
some reason we're basically they just
fire<00:01:46.890> entities<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:48.060> fly<00:01:48.390> around<00:01:48.540> until<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
fire entities they fly around until they

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
fire entities they fly around until they
finally<00:01:49.530> hit<00:01:49.920> something<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.850> soon<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.149> they

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
finally hit something as soon as they

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
finally hit something as soon as they
hear<00:01:51.329> something<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.990> explode<00:01:52.500> while<00:01:52.740> they

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
hear something they explode while they

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
hear something they explode while they
set<00:01:53.430> alight<00:01:53.670> basically<00:01:54.180> there's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.750> drill

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
set alight basically there's a drill

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
set alight basically there's a drill
item<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> shockwave<00:01:55.740> item<00:01:56.130> until<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.520> get

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
item and a shockwave item until we get

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
item and a shockwave item until we get
on<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> awesomeness<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.380> i<00:01:58.469> fly<00:01:58.680> over

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
on to the awesomeness so if i fly over

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
on to the awesomeness so if i fly over
here<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.899> destroy<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.259> much<00:02:01.500> yet

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
here don't want to destroy so much yet

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.469 
here don't want to destroy so much yet
the<00:02:03.060> drill<00:02:03.450> item<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.320> literally<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.890> ah

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the drill item I just literally just ah

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.380 
the drill item I just literally just ah
just<00:02:06.479> drills<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> sin<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> earth<00:02:08.390> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
just drills the sin of the earth so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.520 
just drills the sin of the earth so
awesome<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.920> believe<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.400> those<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
awesome and I believe that those are the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.649 
awesome and I believe that those are the
flying<00:02:13.530> blocks<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.430> into<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.000> tornado<00:02:15.450> I'd

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
flying blocks to go into the tornado I'd

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.920 
flying blocks to go into the tornado I'd
I'm<00:02:15.930> unsure<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.439> the<00:02:16.560> month<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.280> oh<00:02:18.030> no<00:02:18.569> okay

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I'm unsure of the month and oh no okay

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.220 
I'm unsure of the month and oh no okay
yeah<00:02:19.110> basically<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.099> drills<00:02:20.430> down<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.540> fires

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
yeah basically it drills down and fires

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.369 
yeah basically it drills down and fires
up<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.340> whatever<00:02:23.939> you<00:02:24.150> drill<00:02:24.540> goes<00:02:25.019> right<00:02:25.290> up

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
up so whatever you drill goes right up

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.800 
up so whatever you drill goes right up
to<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.590> roof<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:26.040> kind<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.450> bit<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
to the roof and kind of it is a bit of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.050 
to the roof and kind of it is a bit of
an<00:02:27.930> anoint<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.769> shock<00:02:29.040> wave<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> wave<00:02:29.700> i<00:02:29.879> am

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
an anoint the shock wave it wave i am

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.220 
an anoint the shock wave it wave i am
form<00:02:30.890> chun<00:02:31.890> chun<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.659> shoot<00:02:33.870> away<00:02:34.049> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
form chun chun you just shoot away the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.180 
form chun chun you just shoot away the
ground<00:02:35.000> anywhere<00:02:36.000> that<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.180> aim<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
ground anywhere that I aim it up and I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.610 
ground anywhere that I aim it up and I
guess<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.640> kind<00:02:38.909> of<00:02:39.000> cool<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.620> pvp

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
guess this would be kind of cool for pvp

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
guess this would be kind of cool for pvp
power<00:02:40.650> coughing<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.549> just<00:02:42.030> disperses<00:02:42.450> them

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
power coughing it just disperses them

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.930 
power coughing it just disperses them
and<00:02:43.349> makes<00:02:43.620> them<00:02:43.709> land<00:02:44.010> lower<00:02:44.310> down<00:02:44.609> so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
and makes them land lower down so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.599 
and makes them land lower down so
ciaochao<00:02:45.390> ciaochao<00:02:46.099> just<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.340> don't<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.549> I

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
ciaochao ciaochao just I don't know I

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.580 
ciaochao ciaochao just I don't know I
think<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:47.940> pretty<00:02:48.030> cool<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
think that's pretty cool it's a it's a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
think that's pretty cool it's a it's a
it's<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.950> bit<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.159> an<00:02:50.250> odd<00:02:50.370> item<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.879> one<00:02:51.329> that

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it's a bit of an odd item and one that

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.509 
it's a bit of an odd item and one that
you<00:02:51.510> probably<00:02:51.720> wouldn't<00:02:52.019> need<00:02:52.260> butter<00:02:53.069> there

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
you probably wouldn't need butter there

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.059 
you probably wouldn't need butter there
you<00:02:53.609> go<00:02:53.870> alongside<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.319> we<00:02:55.500> do<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.859> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you go alongside this we do have the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.890 
you go alongside this we do have the
surfboard<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> surfboard<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.659> obviously

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
surfboard now the surfboard is obviously

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.720 
surfboard now the surfboard is obviously
used<00:02:58.109> in<00:02:58.260> water<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.250> moment<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.549> can

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
used in water but the moment you can

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.670 
used in water but the moment you can
only<00:02:59.849> stand<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.540> can't<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:00.959> go

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
only stand on it you can't actually go

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.319 
only stand on it you can't actually go
on<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.129> swim<00:03:02.849> or<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.359> anything<00:03:03.599> with<00:03:03.959> it

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
on it and swim or do anything with it

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.940 
on it and swim or do anything with it
this<00:03:06.329> is<00:03:06.540> also<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.870> part<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> weather<00:03:07.620> mods

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
this is also a part of the weather mods

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.860 
this is also a part of the weather mods
which<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.670> do<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.569> just<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
which I do have but it's just the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.280 
which I do have but it's just the
tornadoes<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:10.920> don't<00:03:11.129> have<00:03:11.280> some

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
tornadoes there but I don't have some

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.500 
tornadoes there but I don't have some
tsunamis<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.650> anything<00:03:13.889> like<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.909> on<00:03:15.209> to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
tsunamis or anything like that so on to

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.319 
tsunamis or anything like that so on to
the<00:03:15.629> grand<00:03:16.109> finale<00:03:16.440> now<00:03:16.949> the<00:03:17.430> only<00:03:17.879> reason<00:03:18.060> you

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
the grand finale now the only reason you

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.780 
the grand finale now the only reason you
probably<00:03:18.449> came<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:20.400> wanted<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.609> give<00:03:20.730> a

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
probably came I just wanted to give a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.650 
probably came I just wanted to give a
basics<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.859> tornado<00:03:23.129> now<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.209> an<00:03:24.389> old

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
basics the tornado now this is an old

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.720 
basics the tornado now this is an old
mod<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.889> thought<00:03:26.099> there's<00:03:26.340> nothing

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
mod but I just thought there's nothing

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550 
mod but I just thought there's nothing
cooler<00:03:27.000> than<00:03:27.180> destroying<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.410> most

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
cooler than destroying one of the most

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.819 
cooler than destroying one of the most
popular<00:03:29.209> minecraft<00:03:30.209> maps<00:03:30.419> out<00:03:30.569> there<00:03:30.840> oh<00:03:30.989> and

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
we found the fire there we go so I

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.599 
we found the fire there we go so I

thought you know what let's do it let's
destroy<00:03:39.180> cops<00:03:39.569> and<00:03:39.780> robbers<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.530> without

destroy cops and robbers so without
further<00:03:41.280> ado<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:42.359> tornado<00:03:42.810> going<00:03:43.109> everybody
