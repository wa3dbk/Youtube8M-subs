00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.330 
months ago
a<00:00:09.349> bit<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.380> an<00:00:10.530> idea<00:00:10.650> where<00:00:11.040> there<00:00:11.160> was<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a bit of an idea where there was a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
a bit of an idea where there was a
Aboriginal<00:00:12.059> Maori<00:00:12.269> game<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> World<00:00:12.870> Cup

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
Aboriginal Maori game at the World Cup

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.350 
Aboriginal Maori game at the World Cup
and<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.860> thought<00:00:14.040> ah<00:00:14.250> maybe<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.120> could<00:00:15.240> do

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and I thought ah maybe we could do

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.180 
and I thought ah maybe we could do
something<00:00:15.599> similar<00:00:15.990> back<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.320> group<00:00:17.010> nine

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
something similar back in group nine

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.000 
something similar back in group nine
where<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.580> here<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> moment<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.920> put<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
where we're here at the moment I put it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
where we're here at the moment I put it
to<00:00:20.189> group<00:00:20.490> 9<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> basically<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.630> accepted<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to group 9 and basically they accepted a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
to group 9 and basically they accepted a
proposal<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.880> sort<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
proposal and from there it's sort of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720 
proposal and from there it's sort of
built<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.230> guess<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.550> here

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
built up I guess to what we see here

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.189 
built up I guess to what we see here
today<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> good<00:00:27.599> opportunity<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.080> all

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
today it's a good opportunity for all

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.779 
today it's a good opportunity for all
the<00:00:28.289> boys<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> rip<00:00:29.340> team<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
the boys to make the rip team and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
the boys to make the rip team and
something<00:00:30.449> different<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> country<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
something different that country I

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
something different that country I
believe<00:00:31.470> hasn't<00:00:31.980> done<00:00:32.099> before<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
believe hasn't done before so it's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.680 
believe hasn't done before so it's
probably<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.380> historical<00:00:35.219> event<00:00:41.690> we've

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
probably a pretty historical event we've

them<00:01:27.869> through<00:01:27.900> halls<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.380> guess<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.890> I'm

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
them through halls I guess and I'm

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.690

look I missed a few opportunities and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.890 
look I missed a few opportunities and
someone<00:03:27.820> should<00:03:27.970> see<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.600> should've<00:03:28.870> taken

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.050 
someone should see it should've taken
but<00:03:29.380> not<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.130> worry<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:30.489> it's<00:03:30.730> one<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:30.970> those

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
