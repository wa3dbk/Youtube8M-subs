00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 hello everyone is united we are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.039
 found today for a new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 recipe on the channel in fact it's the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 first even who was before sunday 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.740
 so frankly if they were going to make me 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 protein pancakes but before that 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.680
 I'm going to show you that a child you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.250
 so at the level of the ingredients that you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.380
 will need 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.300
 the necessary protein proteins in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 powder did any of it go in 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 my neck chocolate truffles I hope 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.820
 that it's going to be good it's the proof that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.950
 I try it then we do not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.129
 whites 2 including three whites 2 with a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 yellow then we need the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 oatmeal so if I know 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.559
 already packed 28 grams of flakes 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.700
 of oats a banana full farthest 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.930
 possible it is the site a little bit scared 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.469
 but that's the only one I had at my 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 disposition 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.360
 finally a blender in a blender 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.000
 sub-prefect so that's what we need 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.000
 a simple one we will start the recent m 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 Oh 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.770
 no 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 and that's the texture that you should 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.020
 give the final obviously based 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 of the protein bell and the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.410
 critical but you are when she eats 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.090
 better the body of scoops and on a 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.470
 list doing I think we're going 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.860
 stay to cook everything on the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.480
 plate 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.380
 so I'll take you with me for the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.380
 last part the video 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 Oh 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.019
 not 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.420
 and that's what it gives like 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.470
 final result so we are a little bit 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.910
 peanut butter on top 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 precisely for the aesthetics then for the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.630
 glossy otherwise level of smell that it's me 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.490
 really makes you think of points to 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.810
 bananas that extremely good it's a 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.640
 little gem of the recipe at the same time 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.930
 I will tell you if you call so 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 recipes estrie not tell me in 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.380
 the comments tell me of the ideas of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.760
 recipes downright and then if not the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.660
 sounds like if you want more if 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.220
 you liked the video 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.840
 and then here we are at the next 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.370
 for other videos now go to 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.370
 the best tasting 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.220
 I'll have it so it's really what I 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.410
 actually say I think it costs 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.700
 really a point a banana is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.410
 excellent with peanut butter by 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.090
 on top it makes change blew a 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.700
 small morning variety instead of where everything 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.760
 time ham is not 3d pancake 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.170
 block is also good for health then 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.580
 finally it's going a little bit 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.590
 feeding so small recipes 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.790
 field jean times that I think not undermine 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.900
 all alone for many of you who 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.670
 look for a little variety 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.800
 precisely in their diet 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.730
 and then I heard a touch and because 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.730
 that frankly it's with that 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.599
 the ca
