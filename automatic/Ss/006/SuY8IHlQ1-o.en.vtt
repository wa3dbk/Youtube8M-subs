Rollie<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.320> think<00:03:10.320> this<00:03:10.440> short<00:03:10.709> program<00:03:11.070> will

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.000 
Rollie I think this short program will
redeem<00:03:11.760> her<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.390> sure<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.680> was<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
redeem her for sure and this was the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.070 
redeem her for sure and this was the
solo<00:03:17.400> jump<00:03:17.700> she<00:03:17.880> chose<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.810> short
