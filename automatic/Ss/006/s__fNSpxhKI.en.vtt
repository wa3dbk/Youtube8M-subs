00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.990 
to be able to say that because I've
really<00:04:11.660> in<00:04:12.080> looking<00:04:12.500> back<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.980> there's<00:04:13.790> just

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
really in looking back and there's just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.580 
really in looking back and there's just
so<00:04:14.390> many<00:04:14.450> movies<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:14.870> I<00:04:15.020> had<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.200> great<00:04:15.410> time

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
so many movies that I had a great time

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.830 
so many movies that I had a great time
doing<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:16.190> I'm<00:04:16.609> lucky<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.600> they've

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
doing and I'm lucky that that they've

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.289 
doing and I'm lucky that that they've
kind<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.440> resonated<00:04:18.950> with<00:04:19.100> people

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
kind of resonated with people

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.430 
kind of resonated with people
but<00:04:20.870> uh<00:04:21.460> but<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> one<00:04:22.789> probably<00:04:23.599> Ron<00:04:23.990> Burgundy

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
but uh but the one probably Ron Burgundy

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.990 
but uh but the one probably Ron Burgundy
anchorman<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:25.009> probably<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.340> one<00:04:25.580> that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
anchorman is probably the one that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.110 
anchorman is probably the one that
sticks<00:04:26.360> out<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.539> most<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:27.110> because<00:04:27.349> it<00:04:27.500> was

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
sticks out the most just because it was

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.839 
sticks out the most just because it was
it<00:04:29.120> was<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.449> hard<00:04:29.750> for<00:04:30.080> us<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.979> get<00:04:31.099> it<00:04:31.250> made<00:04:31.460> you

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 
it was so hard for us to get it made you

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.240 
it was so hard for us to get it made you
know<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.210> had<00:04:32.690> you<00:04:33.139> know<00:04:33.259> a<00:04:33.289> bunch<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.949> I

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
know and we had you know a bunch of I

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.930 
know and we had you know a bunch of I
think<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.610> had<00:04:35.169> 10<00:04:36.169> or<00:04:36.409> 11<00:04:36.860> Studios<00:04:37.460> turn<00:04:37.819> us

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
think we had 10 or 11 Studios turn us

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.460 
think we had 10 or 11 Studios turn us
down<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.300> one<00:04:38.479> day<00:04:38.659> when<00:04:38.930> we<00:04:39.020> first<00:04:39.199> had<00:04:39.409> the

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
and and so the fact that it's kind of

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.839 
and and so the fact that it's kind of
has<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.229> kind<00:04:54.409> of<00:04:54.469> cult<00:04:54.740> following<00:04:55.430> that<00:04:55.460> does

has the kind of cult following that does
and<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.780> reason<00:04:56.990> why<00:04:57.080> we're<00:04:57.199> making<00:04:57.289> a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
and is the reason why we're making a

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.029 
and is the reason why we're making a

that aren't really for long-form it's

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.740 
that aren't really for long-form it's
there<00:05:43.460> they<00:05:43.639> really<00:05:43.880> are<00:05:44.000> just<00:05:44.029> kind<00:05:44.690> of

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
there they really are just kind of

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.740 
there they really are just kind of
little<00:05:45.469> little<00:05:45.860> sketches<00:05:46.340> and<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:46.819> you<00:05:47.630> know

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
little little sketches and and you know

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.680 
little little sketches and and you know
better<00:05:48.289> suited<00:05:48.560> for<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.800> internet<00:05:49.129> and<00:05:49.690> but

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
better suited for the internet and but

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.420 
better suited for the internet and but
it<00:05:50.779> but<00:05:51.020> for<00:05:51.469> us<00:05:51.590> I<00:05:51.800> think<00:05:51.830> it's<00:05:52.069> even<00:05:52.279> more

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
it but for us I think it's even more

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.159 
it but for us I think it's even more
exciting<00:05:52.879> that<00:05:53.240> it's<00:05:53.509> now<00:05:53.900> becoming<00:05:54.560> this

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
exciting that it's now becoming this

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.249 
exciting that it's now becoming this
developing<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:58.310> know<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:59.150> don't<00:05:59.930> know<00:05:59.990> kind<00:06:00.169> of

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
developing you know I don't know kind of

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.010
