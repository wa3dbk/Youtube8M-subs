00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.809
 hi how about my name is boris soles and 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.469
 good and yoyos let's explain how it 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.710
 untangle the hair as after 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.630
 have washed it because we already have 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.990
 the hair washed as you see and the hair 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.480
 is the change is entangled we are going to 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.660
 put a little conditioner and let's 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.400
 to start applying it from the middle to 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.590
 tip and then with what we about the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.540
 Palm of the hand 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.540
 and we give the rest of the hair 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.030
 Well, we already have the conditioner 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.910
 we have had it in the palms of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.550
 hands and we started from middle 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 notes that where more is not needed 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.430
 hair and what we have left 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.430
 we give him 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.570
 has remade pithy and we already have the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.230
 Conditioner applied nothing well is 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.229
 maybe the part that all the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.250
 world has asked us the question of how 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.910
 gets rid of hair 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.530
 without giving many pulls normally the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.619
 people start to descend to the hair 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.950
 from the root to the tip in with what 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.619
 they create a traffic jam in this area here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.420
 always one of blood is in this part 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.640
 from here 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.640
 and the hair ends up stuck 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 and after training it is quite 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.600
 complicated 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.240
 well the right way off the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 hair that is from the tips toward 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.040
 started up untangling of 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 parts 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.940
 it's great to untangle from the part of the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.570
 tip 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.570
 up and so 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 we will avoid 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.490
 we will avoid these jams and these pulls 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.490
 that many times 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.659
 It does not happen much but it costs me 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.560
 a lot of work you see how easy it is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.259
 when you want in clay 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.950
 from the tip you do not see how easy it is not 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.950
 may l 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 once we have entered the tip 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.040
 we already have a hard time 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.200
 something that you should also avoid there 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.840
 many people who also tend to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.209
 doing is brushing your hair when 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.390
 It's wet when we're the ones 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.579
 you never have to catch your hair 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.819
 wet hair only breaks down with 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.590
 comb you should never despair with ever 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.269
 you want to stay by brush because what 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.879
 what we do that is to throw the fibers 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.340
 of the cuticle is given to us but it is going to 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.519
 April is easier is faster I hope 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.379
 the hair always unravels with the 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.650
 hair always unravels with the 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.650
 hair 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.129
 well I hope you liked this 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.129
 little trick and until next time
