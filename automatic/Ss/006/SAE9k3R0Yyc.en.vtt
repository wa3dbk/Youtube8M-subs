00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.020 
galaxy s2 yeah there's a 1.2 gigahertz
processor<00:01:27.229> though<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.710> single<00:01:29.340> core<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
processor though it's a single core so I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.539 
processor though it's a single core so I
don't<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.420> if<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> maybe<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
don't know if it's going to maybe it's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
don't know if it's going to maybe it's a
little<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:33.000> laggy<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.439> much<00:01:34.829> cheaper

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
little bit laggy but it's much cheaper

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.819 
little bit laggy but it's much cheaper
and<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.180> running<00:01:36.420> android<00:01:37.079> 2.2<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:40.560> has
