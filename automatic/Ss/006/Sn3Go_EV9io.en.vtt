be showing you how to make one of these
it's<00:00:16.249> activated<00:00:16.580> by<00:00:16.849> a<00:00:16.880> lever<00:00:17.560> first<00:00:18.560> I'm

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
it's activated by a lever first I'm

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.189 
it's activated by a lever first I'm
going<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:19.070> put<00:00:19.669> down<00:00:19.789> a<00:00:19.849> note<00:00:20.300> blockage<00:00:20.810> just

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199

see<00:00:21.349> how<00:00:21.470> fast<00:00:21.740> it's<00:00:22.009> pulsing<00:00:25.749> okay<00:00:26.749> so<00:00:26.810> we

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
see how fast it's pulsing okay so we

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.550 
see how fast it's pulsing okay so we
need<00:00:27.169> to<00:00:27.320> match<00:00:27.499> that<00:00:28.929> here<00:00:29.929> are<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.109> few

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
need to match that here are a few

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
it's not going fast enough so we'll need

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.150 
it's not going fast enough so we'll need
to<00:00:38.510> speed<00:00:38.750> up<00:00:38.780> a<00:00:39.019> bit<00:00:39.050> but<00:00:39.410> if<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.649> speed<00:00:39.949> it<00:00:40.070> up

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
to speed up a bit but if you speed it up

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.420 
to speed up a bit but if you speed it up
it<00:00:40.940> still<00:00:41.449> doesn't<00:00:41.600> go<00:00:41.780> fastener<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.469> if<00:00:43.100> the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
it still doesn't go fastener and if the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.840 
it still doesn't go fastener and if the
torch<00:00:43.670> here<00:00:43.879> burns<00:00:44.149> out<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:46.460> I've<00:00:46.609> come<00:00:46.789> up
