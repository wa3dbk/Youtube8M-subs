for<00:00:13.889> our<00:00:14.120> museum<00:00:15.120> objects<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.809> won't<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> using

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
for our museum objects I won't be using

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.160 
for our museum objects I won't be using
real<00:00:16.770> museum<00:00:17.250> objects<00:00:17.699> punch<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.080> going

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
real museum objects punch so we're going

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.900 
real museum objects punch so we're going
to<00:00:19.260> create<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> cavity<00:00:19.770> much<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.850> one

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to create a cavity much like this one

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540 
to create a cavity much like this one
that<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.359> made<00:00:21.750> earlier<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> day<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.430> we're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that I made earlier in the day and we're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
that I made earlier in the day and we're
going<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> create<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.180> using<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
going to create it using this for this

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029 
going to create it using this for this
item<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.990> decided<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> make

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
item right here and we decided to make

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.700 
item right here and we decided to make
them<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.340> fit<00:00:29.550> into<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.880> custom<00:00:30.390> box<00:00:30.710> which

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
them to fit into this custom box which

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.110 
them to fit into this custom box which
is<00:00:31.890> also<00:00:32.070> created<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.640> University<00:00:33.329> products

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
is also created by University products

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
is also created by University products
now<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> I'll<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:38.160> take

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
now the first thing that I'll do is take

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.830 
now the first thing that I'll do is take
a<00:00:38.610> big<00:00:38.850> piece<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> foam<00:00:40.160> and<00:00:41.160> cut<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
a big piece at the foam and cut out to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.549 
a big piece at the foam and cut out to
measure<00:00:43.700> these<00:00:44.700> cavities<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.420> Box<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:46.140> 8

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
measure these cavities in the Box are 8

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
measure these cavities in the Box are 8
inches<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:47.010> 6<00:00:47.489> inches<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> will<00:00:48.510> first

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
inches by 6 inches so I will first

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.369 
inches by 6 inches so I will first
measure<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:54.629> I'll<00:00:54.840> start<00:00:55.050> by<00:00:55.199> using

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
measure that out and I'll start by using

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.119 
measure that out and I'll start by using
the<00:00:55.739> other<00:00:55.890> foam<00:00:56.570> nice<00:00:57.570> saw<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.649> first<00:00:58.920> we

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the other foam nice saw but first we

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.319 
the other foam nice saw but first we
have<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.460> cut<00:01:00.120> protection<00:01:00.660> gloves<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
have some cut protection gloves and the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
have some cut protection gloves and the
nice<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.769> doesn't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
nice thing about this is it doesn't

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.240 
nice thing about this is it doesn't
leave<00:01:05.159> any<00:01:05.189> tape<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> nice<00:01:07.890> razor

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
leave any tape it's it's a nice razor

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.620 
leave any tape it's it's a nice razor
blade<00:01:09.650> type<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.120 

this<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:19.780> my<00:01:19.900> favorite<00:01:20.380> piece<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.979> think<00:01:21.280> it's<00:01:21.580> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this is my favorite piece I think it's a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.670 
this is my favorite piece I think it's a
box<00:01:24.130> here<00:01:24.490> now<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:25.570> have<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.930> basic

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
box here now that we have the basic

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.950 
box here now that we have the basic
mount<00:01:27.070> shape<00:01:27.550> cut<00:01:27.880> out<00:01:28.000> I'll<00:01:28.360> use<00:01:28.720> these

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
mount shape cut out I'll use these

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
mount shape cut out I'll use these
benchmark<00:01:29.590> foam<00:01:30.130> knife<00:01:30.400> -<00:01:30.790> Oh

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

shave<00:01:33.460> off<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:33.880> bit<00:01:34.210> extra<00:01:34.710> okay<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:35.770> now

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
shave off a little bit extra okay so now

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.490 
shave off a little bit extra okay so now
that<00:01:36.100> we<00:01:36.400> have<00:01:36.610> our<00:01:36.810> block<00:01:37.810> I've<00:01:37.990> got<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.259> foam

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
that we have our block I've got the foam

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.830 
that we have our block I've got the foam
where<00:01:38.740> you're<00:01:38.830> gonna<00:01:38.920> create<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.910> cavity<00:01:40.150> for

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
where you're gonna create a cavity for

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.480 
where you're gonna create a cavity for
this<00:01:40.960> little<00:01:41.140> object<00:01:41.290> again<00:01:41.830> it's<00:01:41.979> not<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.190> real

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
this little object again it's not a real

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.630 
this little object again it's not a real
museum<00:01:42.880> object<00:01:43.540> or<00:01:43.720> basically<00:01:44.170> my<00:01:44.590> first<00:01:44.890> step

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
museum object or basically my first step

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.850 
museum object or basically my first step
is<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:46.119> trace<00:01:47.670> pattern<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.869> we<00:01:50.050> will<00:01:50.289> use<00:01:52.860> now

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
is to trace pattern that we will use now

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.469 
is to trace pattern that we will use now
of<00:01:53.979> course<00:01:54.130> we're<00:01:54.340> going<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.490> have<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.940> have

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
of course we're going to have to have

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.570 
of course we're going to have to have
some<00:01:55.930> idea<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.770> depth<00:01:57.039> of<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.369> cavity

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
some idea of the depth of the cavity

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.779 
some idea of the depth of the cavity
we're<00:01:57.940> going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.119> create<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.380> this<00:02:00.039> object<00:02:00.310> is

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
we're going to create so this object is

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.370 
we're going to create so this object is
a<00:02:00.970> gauge<00:02:01.330> which<00:02:01.960> we<00:02:02.289> will<00:02:02.470> use<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.680> form<00:02:04.380> an

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
a gauge which we will use to form an

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380 
a gauge which we will use to form an
impression<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.250> object<00:02:06.789> so<00:02:06.940> when<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.180> take

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
impression of the object so when I take

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.100 
impression of the object so when I take
this<00:02:07.630> base<00:02:08.130> which<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.310> about<00:02:09.580> maybe<00:02:10.570> six

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
this base which is about maybe six

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.310 
this base which is about maybe six
inches<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:12.150> height<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:14.910> try<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.970> form<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:17.290> shape

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
inches in height I try to form the shape

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.070 
inches in height I try to form the shape
of<00:02:17.860> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.900 

I<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.710> that'll<00:02:23.980> work<00:02:24.010> they'll<00:02:24.430> give<00:02:24.670> us<00:02:24.790> an

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
I think that'll work they'll give us an

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.790 
I think that'll work they'll give us an
approximation<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.960> depth<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.530> when<00:02:26.680> we

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
approximation of the depth so when we

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.400 
approximation of the depth so when we
begin<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.220> cut<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.550> cavity<00:02:28.020> we<00:02:29.020> will<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.320> able

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
begin to cut the cavity we will be able

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.220 
begin to cut the cavity we will be able
to<00:02:29.620> use<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.160> as<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> measurement<00:02:30.850> how<00:02:31.840> deep<00:02:32.080> we

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
to use this as a measurement how deep we

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.350 
to use this as a measurement how deep we
wanna<00:02:32.440> go<00:02:33.960> so<00:02:34.960> now<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.110> got<00:02:35.350> my<00:02:35.850> gloves<00:02:36.850> back<00:02:36.940> on

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360

simply a cotton twill tape that you
could<00:05:53.099> put<00:05:53.340> inside<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.510> cavity<00:05:55.260> before<00:05:55.680> you

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
could put inside the cavity before you

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.490 
could put inside the cavity before you
put<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.030> object<00:05:57.150> inside<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:58.020> it<00:05:58.169> once<00:05:58.349> the

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
put the object inside of it once the

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.680 
put the object inside of it once the
object<00:05:58.620> was<00:05:58.979> inside<00:05:59.400> the<00:06:00.060> idea<00:06:00.360> is<00:06:00.539> you<00:06:00.660> can

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
object was inside the idea is you can

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.070 
object was inside the idea is you can
use<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:02.520> tool<00:06:02.760> tape<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.150> lift<00:06:03.389> it<00:06:03.539> out<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
use the tool tape to lift it out of the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.040 
use the tool tape to lift it out of the
cavity<00:06:04.470> without<00:06:04.770> damaging<00:06:05.460> it<00:06:05.840> I'm<00:06:06.840> also

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
cavity without damaging it I'm also

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.260 
cavity without damaging it I'm also
going<00:06:07.380> to<00:06:08.060> add<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.810> layer<00:06:10.260> of<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:11.639> artifact

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
going to add a layer of the artifact

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.380 
going to add a layer of the artifact
wrap

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.820 

again<00:06:19.390> this<00:06:19.510> is<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.720> nice<00:06:19.990> soft<00:06:20.410> smooth

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
again this is a nice soft smooth

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.060 
again this is a nice soft smooth
material<00:06:21.100> it's<00:06:21.850> inert<00:06:25.590> and<00:06:26.590> we<00:06:26.650> just<00:06:26.860> lay<00:06:27.010> it

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
material it's inert and we just lay it

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.480 
material it's inert and we just lay it
across<00:06:27.250> the<00:06:27.760> at<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.210> foam<00:06:28.390> block<00:06:29.250> so<00:06:30.250> we<00:06:30.340> have

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
across the at the foam block so we have

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.720 
across the at the foam block so we have
to<00:06:30.640> create<00:06:30.880> a<00:06:30.940> nice<00:06:31.240> soft<00:06:31.570> cavity<00:06:32.140> in<00:06:32.230> there

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
to create a nice soft cavity in there

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:44.640 
to create a nice soft cavity in there
now<00:06:33.730> we<00:06:33.790> can<00:06:34.030> place<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:34.420> object<00:06:34.840> inside<00:06:43.650> the

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
now we can place the object inside the

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:51.480 
now we can place the object inside the
heat<00:06:44.860> mist<00:06:45.160> you<00:06:45.310> can<00:06:45.460> trim<00:06:46.150> it<00:06:50.130> and<00:06:51.130> now<00:06:51.340> your

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
heat mist you can trim it and now your

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.280 
heat mist you can trim it and now your
object<00:06:51.910> is<00:06:52.060> safe<00:06:52.300> and<00:06:52.510> secure<00:06:52.840> and<00:06:53.020> ready<00:06:53.170> for

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
object is safe and secure and ready for

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.910 
object is safe and secure and ready for
storage<00:06:55.050> if<00:06:56.050> you<00:06:56.230> want<00:06:56.410> you<00:06:56.530> can<00:06:56.650> add<00:06:56.800> an

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
storage if you want you can add an

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.300 
storage if you want you can add an
artifact<00:06:57.430> ID<00:06:57.820> tag<00:06:58.350> to<00:06:59.350> the<00:06:59.530> object<00:06:59.980> to

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
artifact ID tag to the object to

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:09.200 
artifact ID tag to the object to
identify<00:07:00.820> it<00:07:01.890> and<00:07:02.890> place<00:07:03.880> it<00:07:04.060> inside<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.420> box

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210
