00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
time has gone by and I've noticed a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.729 
time has gone by and I've noticed a
direct<00:00:31.529> correlation<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.759> how<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.350> sugar<00:00:34.350> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
direct correlation with how much sugar I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
direct correlation with how much sugar I
eat<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.090> I've<00:00:36.570> been<00:00:36.660> researching<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.260> lot

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
eat and I've been researching a lot

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
eat and I've been researching a lot
about<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:39.510> realized<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:41.520> me<00:00:41.809> I'm

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
about it and I realized that for me I'm

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.639 
about it and I realized that for me I'm
noticing<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:44.550> when<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.270> eat<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:46.200> sugar

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
noticing that when I do eat more sugar

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.760 
noticing that when I do eat more sugar
and<00:00:47.010> I'm<00:00:47.340> talking<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.640> refined<00:00:48.090> sugar<00:00:48.420> like

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
and I'm talking about refined sugar like

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.299 
and I'm talking about refined sugar like
things<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.890> pastries<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.910> donuts<00:00:51.899> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
things like pastries and donuts and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
things like pastries and donuts and
things<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> nature<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.600> holiday

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
things of that nature it's the holiday

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
things of that nature it's the holiday
season<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.649> seems<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.399> more

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
season so that seems to be more

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
season so that seems to be more
prevalent<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.660> skin<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:59.750> getting<00:01:00.750> super

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
prevalent that my skin is getting super

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.250 
prevalent that my skin is getting super
duper<00:01:03.019> broken<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.460> I'll<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.560> I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
duper broken out I'll show that to you I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.690 
duper broken out I'll show that to you I
don't<00:01:10.260> really<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.460> one

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
don't really have much I have this one

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.170 
don't really have much I have this one
on<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.909> forehead<00:01:12.200> but<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.729> what's<00:01:14.939> going

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
on my forehead but this is what's going

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
on my forehead but this is what's going
on<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.900> skin<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:18.320> kind<00:01:19.320> of

on with my skin and it's kind of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.270 
on with my skin and it's kind of
bothersome<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.720> I've<00:01:21.720> decided<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.280> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
bothersome so I've decided that I'm

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
not eating sugar that mean doesn't mean

diet<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.930> seems<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> no<00:01:37.500> matter

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
diet because it seems that no matter

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
diet because it seems that no matter
what<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.180> with<00:01:39.180> my<00:01:39.210> skin<00:01:39.630> care<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:41.430> doesn't

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410 
change this the acne doesn't get any
better<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:47.280> research<00:01:47.460> from<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.909> from<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
better so my research from the from the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
better so my research from the from the
eating<00:01:48.659> sugar<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> eat

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
eating sugar thing is that when you eat

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
eating sugar thing is that when you eat
sugar<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> actually<00:01:51.360> causes<00:01:51.540> inflammation<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
sugar it actually causes inflammation in

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.590 
sugar it actually causes inflammation in
your<00:01:52.649> body<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.970> happen<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> get

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
your body and I happen to get

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
inflammation that shows up as acne so
