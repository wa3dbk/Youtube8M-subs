00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
piece opens up so you can load the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.610 
piece opens up so you can load the
product

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.520 

that<00:02:25.130> one<00:02:25.280> has<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> hole<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.140> we'll<00:02:27.140> get<00:02:27.319> rid

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that one has a hole in it we'll get rid

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.500 
that one has a hole in it we'll get rid
of<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.290 

make<00:02:31.510> sure<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.140> vote<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:34.000> load

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
make sure when you vote you load

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.059 
make sure when you vote you load
straight<00:02:34.750> across<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.530> here<00:02:35.950> here<00:02:38.069> don't

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
straight across like here here don't

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.940 
straight across like here here don't
stack<00:02:39.970> them<00:02:40.239> up<00:02:40.360> higher<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:41.020> one<00:02:41.050> side<00:02:41.620> like

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
stack them up higher on one side like

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.800 
stack them up higher on one side like
this<00:02:42.220> because<00:02:42.610> when<00:02:42.849> they<00:02:42.970> fall<00:02:43.239> over<00:02:43.569> them

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
this because when they fall over them

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.010 
this because when they fall over them
jam<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.440> machine<00:02:46.830> fairly<00:02:47.830> self-explanatory

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
jam the machine fairly self-explanatory

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.870 
jam the machine fairly self-explanatory
you<00:02:50.020> just<00:02:50.530> put<00:02:50.830> whatever<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> machine

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
you just put whatever is in the machine

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.070 
you just put whatever is in the machine
on<00:02:52.630> top<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:56.190> fill<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.310> Machine<00:02:57.700> up<00:02:58.050> do<00:02:59.050> not

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
on top and fill the Machine up do not

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.780 
on top and fill the Machine up do not
get<00:02:59.590> too<00:03:00.340> kind<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:01.030> appear<00:03:01.300> on<00:03:01.450> top<00:03:02.610> leave<00:03:03.610> it

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
get too kind to appear on top leave it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.490 
get too kind to appear on top leave it
up<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:03.970> about<00:03:04.269> right<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.900> here<00:03:05.200> somewhere

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
up to about right in here somewhere

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.509 
up to about right in here somewhere
because<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.519> does<00:03:06.730> have<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.239> cycle<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.709> it

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.870 
numbers inside the Machine you'll see
here<00:03:29.830> where<00:03:30.040> they're<00:03:30.220> numbered<00:03:30.610> they

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
here where they're numbered they

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.360 
here where they're numbered they
correspond<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.260> buttons<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.220> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
correspond with the buttons on the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.050 
correspond with the buttons on the
outside<00:03:33.400> of<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> machine

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.600 

you<00:03:38.270> can<00:03:38.420> see<00:03:38.660> right<00:03:38.960> here<00:03:39.350> this<00:03:39.860> row<00:03:40.130> is

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
you can see right here this row is

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.450 
you can see right here this row is
what's<00:03:40.880> known<00:03:41.150> as<00:03:41.210> a<00:03:41.420> double<00:03:41.870> row<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:43.220> will

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
what's known as a double row it will

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.850 
what's known as a double row it will
hold<00:03:43.670> twice<00:03:44.090> as<00:03:44.420> many<00:03:44.660> you<00:03:45.140> see<00:03:45.350> their<00:03:45.560> stacks

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
hold twice as many you see their stacks

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.000 
hold twice as many you see their stacks
on<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.370> side<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.780> will<00:03:47.930> hold<00:03:48.110> twice<00:03:48.440> as<00:03:48.770> many

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
on the side it will hold twice as many

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.910 
on the side it will hold twice as many
as<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.580> single<00:03:49.970> rows<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.410> where<00:03:51.770> you

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
as the single rows this is where you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.370 
as the single rows this is where you
want<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.220> put<00:03:52.400> your<00:03:52.550> bestsellers<00:03:53.380> obviously

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
want to put your bestsellers obviously

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:05.580 
want to put your bestsellers obviously
because<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:56.180> holds<00:03:56.570> more<00:03:56.720> product

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.670 

Phil<00:04:06.630> machine-like<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.810> say<00:04:08.020> don't<00:04:08.320> go<00:04:08.500> any

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
Phil machine-like I say don't go any

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.670 
Phil machine-like I say don't go any
higher<00:04:08.770> than<00:04:08.980> this<00:04:09.280> right<00:04:09.670> here<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:11.530> get

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
higher than this right here you get

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.229 
higher than this right here you get
finished

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
that back over in the middle so you

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.099 
that back over in the middle so you
won't<00:04:17.889> have<00:04:18.040> any<00:04:18.310> accidents<00:04:18.870> with<00:04:19.870> the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
won't have any accidents with the

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.129 
won't have any accidents with the
probably<00:04:20.859> falling<00:04:21.370> over<00:04:21.639> against<00:04:22.090> your<00:04:22.270> door

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
probably falling over against your door

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.159 
probably falling over against your door
here<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.740> causing<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.430> jam

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.939

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
and that is that is about it other than

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.540 
and that is that is about it other than
closing<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.669> machine<00:04:33.499> always<00:04:34.520> make<00:04:35.520> sure

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
closing the machine always make sure

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.519 
closing the machine always make sure
that<00:04:35.849> you've<00:04:36.360> got<00:04:36.389> some<00:04:36.810> pressure<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.289> the

that you've got some pressure on the

that you've got some pressure on the
door<00:04:38.029> that<00:04:39.029> way<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.479> will<00:04:40.999> go<00:04:41.999> into<00:04:42.240> the
