00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.210
 stéphane benoît main poses the question 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.430
 here actually says he's making sixty 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.139
 thousand kilometers a year and that he 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.499
 keeps his cars on average until 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.180
 500 thousand kilometers per hour in total 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.350
 so it's almost half a million 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.450
 kilometers before changing vehicles 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.620
 to know what to choose 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.170
 between a touring odyssey of honda all 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.380
 the 2013 models by passing a siren to 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.309
 Ixelles four-wheel drive Toyota 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 or else the quest is there or rather it 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.199
 of nice in 2013 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.920
 listen to me I think I would have 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.989
 downright to a honda odyssey 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.829
 it's definitely the minivan 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.589
 the most suitable configuration for 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.999
 do the mileage when we hold 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.609
 account of his suspension 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.710
 the configuration of the suspension of a 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.229
 honda odyssey allows to have a 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.510
 road stability that you will not have 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.180
 among competitors it is a vehicle 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
 also who is a little lower who still 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 once promotes stability 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.360
 less noisy on the road this is a 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.700
 van that offer good 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.549
 performance also at its level 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 motor and that still values ​​enough 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.640
 well 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 fuel economy of course a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 saw and no it's very close but when 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.299
 we think about the configuration of 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.640
 suspensions there I tell you all of 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.729
 more at honda we do not have a lead 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.109
 compared to toyota design too 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.140
 global Toyota is at the level of 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.090
 interior design concept 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.939
 it's less well suited I find for 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.520
 long, very long distances like 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.350
 you do then the quest will listen on 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.380
 lack of data on this vehicle 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.190
 it has just been configured we do not have 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.930
 still enough perspective to do 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.340
 some appreciations that it is 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:06.010
 especially that are zincs has been enough 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 unorthodox then we ask ourselves the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.229
 question will it stay the same 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.780
 still a long time 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.300
 so me when we talk about 500 thousand 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.100
 kilometers there we are not there with the pop 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.560
 as we say and then we see with 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.560
 something very safe doubt these
