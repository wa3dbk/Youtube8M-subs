and I'm gonna I'm gonna check that out
I'm<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> try<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.910> because

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I'm going to try and make it because

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
I'm going to try and make it because
that's<00:00:54.329> pretty<00:00:54.510> legit<00:00:54.750> anyway<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.800> here's<00:00:56.789> how

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that's pretty legit anyway so here's how

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
that's pretty legit anyway so here's how
it<00:00:57.059> works<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.870> how<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> works<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it works so how it works is you have to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540 
it works so how it works is you have to
see<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.649> door<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:02.039> whatever<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> want

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
see the little door or whatever you want

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.630 
see the little door or whatever you want
to<00:01:02.609> call<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.979> what<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> did<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to call it and then what I did is that I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.469 
to call it and then what I did is that I
stuck<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:07.340> blow<00:01:08.340> tube<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.150> through

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
stuck the blow tube all the way through

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
stuck the blow tube all the way through
because<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.200> long<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.650> like

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
because you can see how long it is like

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.760 
because you can see how long it is like
that<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.970> why<00:01:12.659> did<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.500> some

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that and why did that if you go some

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
that and why did that if you go some
guys<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
guys they just like put it like right

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
guys they just like put it like right
there<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.350> when<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> open<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
there and then when you open it up you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
there and then when you open it up you
know<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> right<00:01:18.299> away<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.140> door

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
know you can see it right away the door

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
know you can see it right away the door
opens<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.600> then

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
opens up but see if you do that then

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.280 
opens up but see if you do that then
there's<00:01:22.890> nothing<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> stop<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.479> air<00:01:24.689> going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
there's nothing to stop the air going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
there's nothing to stop the air going
through<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.920> through<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> top<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
through the going through the top of it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
through the going through the top of it
you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.860> decreases<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.610> power

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you know and it just decreases the power

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.050 
you know and it just decreases the power
so<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> did<00:01:31.250> just<00:01:32.250> made<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> tube<00:01:32.700> longer

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
so what I did just made the tube longer

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
so what I did just made the tube longer
and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.100> you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
difficult to use very easy to make on me

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.230 
difficult to use very easy to make on me
and<00:02:12.680> took<00:02:12.800> me<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.190> an<00:02:13.340> hour<00:02:13.400> but<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:14.120> know

and took me like an hour but you know
once<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:14.690> figured<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.080> out<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.350> pretty<00:02:15.500> easy

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
once I figured it out it's pretty easy

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390 
once I figured it out it's pretty easy
you<00:02:16.790> know<00:02:17.209> trigger<00:02:17.690> does<00:02:18.020> nothing<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
you know trigger does nothing but you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.800 
you know trigger does nothing but you
can<00:02:19.550> kind<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.030> aiming<00:02:20.360> system<00:02:20.510> on

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810

there it's pretty cool I think you can
kind<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.140> see<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.860> little<00:02:25.130> bit<00:02:25.340> let<00:02:25.760> me<00:02:25.850> see<00:02:26.000> if

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
kind of see a little bit let me see if

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
you can see right there you can see a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.120 
you can see right there you can see a
little<00:02:27.770> bit<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.750> aiming<00:02:30.410> system<00:02:30.709> there

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
little bit of the aiming system there

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.400 
little bit of the aiming system there
you<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.300> isn't<00:02:33.110> just<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
you can see that this isn't just a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.050 
you can see that this isn't just a
little<00:02:33.620> stick<00:02:33.890> sticking<00:02:34.220> up<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.820> for

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
little stick sticking up this is for

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.210 
little stick sticking up this is for
accuracy<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.500> know<00:02:36.590> you're<00:02:36.860> sticking

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
accuracy and so you know you're sticking

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.610 
accuracy and so you know you're sticking
it<00:02:37.340> straight<00:02:37.610> down<00:02:37.790> or<00:02:38.209> not<00:02:38.690> aiming<00:02:39.110> straight

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
it straight down or not aiming straight

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.500 
it straight down or not aiming straight
down<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.220> don't<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.459> why<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:40.610> say<00:02:40.820> stick<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.390> all

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
down I don't know why I say stick it all

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.920 
down I don't know why I say stick it all
the<00:02:41.660> time<00:02:41.690> anyway<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.270> that's<00:02:44.270> basically<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the time anyway so that's basically it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.320 
the time anyway so that's basically it
and<00:02:45.320> be<00:02:46.070> looking<00:02:46.370> forward<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:46.910> stakeout

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
and be looking forward to my stakeout
