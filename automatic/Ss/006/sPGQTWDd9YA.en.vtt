00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
really in a ball but more of like a

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
really in a ball but more of like a
strip<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.150> peeling<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
strip like this and then peeling it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that that works better when taking off

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
that that works better when taking off
your<00:01:13.729> polish<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> need<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> shape

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and it took me a while it actually took

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.949 
and it took me a while it actually took
me<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.330> use<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.870> get<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.140> done<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:33.160> well

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
hand so it just takes practice don't get

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.670 
hand so it just takes practice don't get
frustrated<00:03:42.630> um<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.380> everyone

so<00:04:22.759> I<00:04:23.030> like<00:04:23.210> using<00:04:23.389> two<00:04:23.720> coats<00:04:23.990> with<00:04:24.319> that<00:04:24.590> some

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
so I like using two coats with that some

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.980 
so I like using two coats with that some
polishes<00:04:25.789> you<00:04:25.940> need<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.270> use<00:04:26.360> more<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.810> just

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
polishes you need to use more it just

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.189 
polishes you need to use more it just
depends<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.560> how<00:04:28.550> light<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.389> color<00:04:29.630> shows<00:04:29.930> up

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
depends on how light the color shows up

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.240 
depends on how light the color shows up
this<00:04:31.099> color<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.490> probably<00:04:31.819> only<00:04:32.270> need<00:04:32.539> to<00:04:32.780> use

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
this color I probably only need to use

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.370 
this color I probably only need to use
one<00:04:34.250> coat<00:04:34.490> but<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:34.970> always<00:04:35.330> feel<00:04:35.569> best<00:04:35.870> using

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
one coat but I always feel best using

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.860 
one coat but I always feel best using
two<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:36.949> I<00:04:37.039> feel<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.490> gets<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.880> 100%

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
two because I feel that it gets it 100%

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.920 
two because I feel that it gets it 100%
