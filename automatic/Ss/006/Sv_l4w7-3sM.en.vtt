00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.260
 internship report you have an internship 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.640
 graduated several weeks and went 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.050
 You want to have a report now 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.840
 to write but how do you do that 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.340
 actually first had as important a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.620
 make cover sheet 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.980
 it should definitely be where 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:28.050
 one completed the internship address 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 E-mail your owner which street and 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 In any case, the weeks input so 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.510
 From what day to what day you have 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 worked there 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.800
 After that you should definitely be on the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.270
 two on the first on the second page 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.340
 to write in introduction 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.430
 It does not have to be many sentences 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
 Couple also right why you go to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.160
 example for the internship decided 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 and what will follow now 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 So what spice internship report 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.670
 you have to write that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.180
 table of contents and so far that one 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.619
 so write an introduction 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.979
 after that comes as I said that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.979
 contents 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 and there you write again 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.170
 internship report 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.030
 So what comes first, for example, the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.070
 description the company afterwards 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.259
 have come and comes in the end how is how 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.700
 I found it and it can be replaced 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.030
 Hang on to hang on 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.720

 Nowadays you have gotten on yours 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.890
 start with the points 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.830
 i just start with why i have 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.270
 chosen it for me 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.910
 why do you have an internship now? 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.509
 chosen because it was because it was close 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.280
 no i would not write that 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.090
 you are interested why does it have you? 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.490
 interest 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.170
 have you ever been in the field earlier 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.580
 completed the internship and still has it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.360
 once made or did you want something new 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.580
 try out 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.810
 did you just so wild it going down 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.539
 or do you know you have this in you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.569
 direction want to go had this 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.740
 free and can answer 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.740
 then maybe you should write 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.870
 after you should something about the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 Write description of the company 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.720
 You can ask one of these questions 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.239
 owner about the owner like 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.060
 since when does this company exist 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.420
 has it been founded internationally or 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.239
 It is a unique thing here 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.890
 who has the idea for this 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.019
 company and which target group 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.200
 So that's what customers come with 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.459
 often quite what to whom 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.049
 turnover or how many employees 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.160
 work 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.750
 Since when is the company there? 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.940
 and so on 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.650
 You should already ask these questions 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.560
 Imagine or when I'm on the internet 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.070
 These agency managers are experiencing times 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.070
 look at 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.610
 after that 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.610
 the imagination 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.920
 Here you can write me about one 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.690
 personal experience among others the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.770
 the working conditions were the data 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.360
 they helped 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.000
 We were working at the 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.460
 internship all personal stuff for 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.650
 Meanwhile, a break a contact person 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.330
 and what were your tasks 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.650
 did you have several small tasks or 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.180
 you had a big main task and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.160
 So how was the structure ? 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.020
 you get up to do the internship 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.430
 and then you can go home or 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.290
 So had no fixed working hours 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.970
 or what knowledge did you know 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290
 you could have known you 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.520
 bring it from school 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:53.070
 or was everything new for you to come now 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.380
 We already have the goals of the internship 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.180
 Come back to the beginning of your internship 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.910
 what were your goals there again 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.560
 reinbekommen what was your task 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 what would you be aiming for at the end of the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.960
 internships 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.390
 and did you do it or why did you 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.610
 you did not make it 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.050
 and what could I do better than 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.730
 next time 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.830
 You could say that differently 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.830
 enroll goals for the internship 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.220
 access penultimate comes the conclusion 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.650
 the conclusion is his assessment of the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.940
 internship there you can do everything 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.050
 personal just a complete the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.630
 please what will it have so you have 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.640
 your strengths and weaknesses are recognized as 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.740
 that was the connection between you and 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.590
 their employer or between the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.700
 Employee she was tense you have 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.230
 you felt well or no one has 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.120
 you recommend the internship 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.940
 would you do it again or have it 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:03.310
 that was enough and how was the situation 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:07.060
 So how was the situation within the 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.550
 agency selbert so what can you do everything 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.020
 write on the edge or and above all 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.540
 future you could imagine 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.000
 to start such a similar job later 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.620
 that is a very important question and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.160
 The uranium wants to explain that further 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.960
 why and why does not it have something 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.070
 you did the internship that 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.680
 you do not want it anymore 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.370
 Indian job has is the practices 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.020
 helped 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:36.940
 continue to build your future as 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.890
 Of course, the last one comes with documents 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.620
 the appendix follows full series of images 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:44.169
 Of course with source then one 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.390
 computer like the internship or 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.770
 so not the diary of heart you have 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.750
 Of course, then every day you did 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.070
 make the signature of caretaker that 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.640
 you ever participated 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:00.340
 just pictures just texts everything you 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.800
 nor taken if you designed eg 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.010
 or something and was allowed to take it 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.000
 Just tack on the back and then 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:13.419
 give to the teacher 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.310
 wait a long time for what teacher says bacher 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.750
 definition internship report gives me 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.770
 I hope I 'm a bit golden 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.570
 creating with these points is on everyone 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.820
 if you have yourselves 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.020
 internship report get one off 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.550
 the internship I would fly myself 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.110
 you usually need not and then another 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.560
 note how to behave there 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.750
 So this note gives 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.370
 owner or owner or since the 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.370
 the same as the internship 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.370
 I did hope together extras
