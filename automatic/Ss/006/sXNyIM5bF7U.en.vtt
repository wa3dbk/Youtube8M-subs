short while ago and I didn't know what
was<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.880> admit<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.809> did<00:00:13.139> open<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.500> up

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
was in it so I admit I did open it up

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770 
was in it so I admit I did open it up
and<00:00:13.830> then<00:00:14.309> once<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.820> saw<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.269> was<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
immediately closed it up again

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.980
