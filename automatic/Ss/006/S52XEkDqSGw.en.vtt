let me just say floyd mayweather in the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.910 
let me just say floyd mayweather in the

last 0 36 hours has said that there is

last 0 36 hours has said that there is
no<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.780> victor<00:00:33.780> ortiz<00:00:33.809> goes<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
no way that victor ortiz goes the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.950 
no way that victor ortiz goes the
distance<00:00:34.890> floyd<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.760> predicting<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.780> he

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
distance floyd is predicting that he

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.709 
distance floyd is predicting that he
stops<00:00:37.670> victor<00:00:38.670> ortiz<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.570> no<00:00:39.690> mistake

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
stops victor ortiz and make no mistake

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
stops victor ortiz and make no mistake
Lloyd<00:00:40.469> has<00:00:41.059> power<00:00:42.739> but<00:00:43.739> Floyd's<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
Lloyd has power but Floyd's a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.750 
Lloyd has power but Floyd's a
counter-puncher<00:00:46.190> so<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.489> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
counter-puncher so let's think this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.779 
counter-puncher so let's think this
through<00:00:47.910> counter<00:00:48.780> punchers<00:00:49.789> necessarily

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
through counter punchers necessarily

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.180 
through counter punchers necessarily
have<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> start<00:00:51.840> slow<00:00:52.289> especially<00:00:52.590> when

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
have to start slow especially when

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.959 
have to start slow especially when
they're<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> guy<00:00:55.110> who<00:00:55.170> has

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
they're going in with the guy who has

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.830 
they're going in with the guy who has
serious<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.270> speed<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:58.190> Victor<00:00:59.190> Ortiz

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
serious hand speed like Victor Ortiz

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
serious hand speed like Victor Ortiz
right<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> believe<00:01:01.530> Floyd<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
right so I believe Floyd is going to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
right so I believe Floyd is going to
start<00:01:03.149> slow<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:03.780> he<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.530> figure<00:01:05.040> out

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
start slow because he has to figure out

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.179 
start slow because he has to figure out
the<00:01:05.810> angles<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.320> punches<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:08.010> you're<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the angles of the punches if you're a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
the angles of the punches if you're a
counter-puncher<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:09.930> counterpunch<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.950> have

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
counter-puncher to counterpunch you have

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.510 
counter-puncher to counterpunch you have
to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.430> able<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> dodge<00:01:12.060> or<00:01:12.540> block<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.280> punch

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to be able to dodge or block the punch

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
to be able to dodge or block the punch
that's<00:01:14.790> being<00:01:15.030> thrown<00:01:15.450> at<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.490> understand

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that's being thrown at you understand

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.160 
that's being thrown at you understand
the<00:01:17.580> dynamic<00:01:18.470> Ortiz<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.700> southpaw<00:01:21.540> who

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the dynamic Ortiz is a southpaw who

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
the dynamic Ortiz is a southpaw who
actually<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:23.189> real<00:01:23.549> life<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:25.759> right-handed

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
actually in real life is right-handed

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.530 
actually in real life is right-handed
right<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.810> Ortiz<00:01:28.229> hits<00:01:28.619> hard<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.280> both<00:01:30.090> hands

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
right so Ortiz hits hard with both hands

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
right so Ortiz hits hard with both hands
and<00:01:31.130> Ortiz<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.460> he's<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.909> his<00:01:33.420> game<00:01:33.890> makes<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and Ortiz when he's on his game makes it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.640 
and Ortiz when he's on his game makes it
hard<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.610> figure<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.840> angles<00:01:37.380> from<00:01:37.560> which

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
hard to figure out the angles from which

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090 
hard to figure out the angles from which
the<00:01:38.100> punches<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.759> coming<00:01:39.270> right<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the punches are coming right and so I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.910 
the punches are coming right and so I
don't<00:01:41.400> believe<00:01:41.549> Floyd<00:01:42.210> Mayweather<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.990> going

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
don't believe Floyd Mayweather is going

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't believe Floyd Mayweather is going
to<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.970> chance<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:46.740> knocking<00:01:47.640> out

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to have any chance of knocking out

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899 
to have any chance of knocking out
Victor<00:01:48.479> Ortiz<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.560> first<00:01:49.890> four<00:01:50.250> rounds<00:01:50.460> in

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
Victor Ortiz in the first four rounds in

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480 
Victor Ortiz in the first four rounds in
fact<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> look<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:52.110> Mayweather's<00:01:52.860> record

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
fact if you look at Mayweather's record

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.200 
fact if you look at Mayweather's record
most<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.149> his<00:01:54.329> fights<00:01:55.009> go<00:01:56.009> past<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.909> four

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
most of his fights go past the four

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
most of his fights go past the four
round<00:01:57.479> mark<00:01:57.840> may<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.409> there's<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.649> slow

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
round mark may where there's a slow

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.149 
round mark may where there's a slow
starter<00:01:59.520> he<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.240> being<00:02:00.540> outdone<00:02:01.259> early<00:02:01.950> by

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
starter he was being outdone early by

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.499 
starter he was being outdone early by
Zab<00:02:02.549> Judah<00:02:02.930> right<00:02:03.930> he<00:02:04.380> got<00:02:04.619> buzzed<00:02:05.130> early<00:02:05.880> by

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
Zab Judah right he got buzzed early by

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.219 
Zab Judah right he got buzzed early by
Shane<00:02:06.869> Mosley<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:08.340> he<00:02:08.610> got<00:02:08.789> days<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
Shane Mosley you know he got days in the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250 
Shane Mosley you know he got days in the
first<00:02:10.530> round<00:02:10.830> there<00:02:11.250> temporarily<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:12.959> Ricky

I<00:02:14.290> believe<00:02:15.290> early<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.130> fight<00:02:16.490> those<00:02:17.450> are

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
I believe early in this fight those are

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.140 
I believe early in this fight those are
going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.900> Victor<00:02:18.530> Ortiz's<00:02:19.250> best<00:02:19.610> rounds

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
going to be Victor Ortiz's best rounds

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.320 
going to be Victor Ortiz's best rounds
let's<00:02:20.360> also<00:02:20.540> look<00:02:20.690> at<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.050> Ortiz<00:02:21.380> record

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
let's also look at the Ortiz record

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.250 
let's also look at the Ortiz record
understand<00:02:23.830> Ortiz<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.400> fast<00:02:25.940> starter<00:02:26.570> he

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
understand Ortiz is a fast starter he

think what this fight is going to be is

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.470 
think what this fight is going to be is
Mayweather<00:03:46.530> cracking<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.370> code<00:03:47.640> probably<00:03:48.330> by

the<00:03:48.510> third<00:03:48.930> round<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.620> then<00:03:50.250> increasingly

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the third round and then increasingly

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.050 
the third round and then increasingly
dominating<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> fight<00:03:52.620> pulling<00:03:53.130> away<00:03:53.250> maybe

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
dominating the fight pulling away maybe

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.390 
dominating the fight pulling away maybe
Mayweather<00:03:54.690> gets<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.380> knockout<00:03:55.830> but<00:03:56.069> if<00:03:56.190> you're

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
Mayweather gets a knockout but if you're

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.070 
Mayweather gets a knockout but if you're
Mayweather<00:03:57.030> by<00:03:57.330> knockout<00:03:58.549> better<00:03:59.549> I<00:04:00.080> believe

Mayweather by knockout better I believe

right understand i don't believe

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.670 
right understand i don't believe
Mayweather<00:04:17.130> has<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.850> power<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:19.200> Andre

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
Mayweather has the power that Andre

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.909 
Mayweather has the power that Andre

Berto has right Marcos Maidana and I

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.040 
Berto has right Marcos Maidana and I
understand<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.550> fight<00:04:23.789> was<00:04:24.000> at<00:04:24.180> 140<00:04:24.900> but

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
understand that fight was at 140 but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.219 
understand that fight was at 140 but
keep<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.350> mind<00:04:25.380> Ortiz<00:04:25.950> was<00:04:26.160> at<00:04:26.340> 142<00:04:27.229> Marcos

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
keep in mind Ortiz was at 142 Marcos

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.180 
keep in mind Ortiz was at 142 Marcos
Maidana<00:04:28.410> pound<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.460> pound<00:04:29.669> at<00:04:29.940> 140<00:04:31.190> it's

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
Maidana pound for pound at 140 it's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.930 
Maidana pound for pound at 140 it's
harder<00:04:32.700> than<00:04:32.729> Floyd<00:04:33.120> Mayweather<00:04:33.600> does<00:04:33.930> at<00:04:34.940> 147

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
harder than Floyd Mayweather does at 147

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.960 
harder than Floyd Mayweather does at 147
so<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:37.110> Mayweather<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.800> get<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.250> knockout<00:04:38.460> in

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
so for Mayweather to get the knockout in

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.990 
so for Mayweather to get the knockout in
my<00:04:39.150> opinion<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.810> would<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.530> be<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:41.070> the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
my opinion it would have to be in the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.150 
my opinion it would have to be in the
second<00:04:42.479> half<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.680> fight<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:43.979> wouldn't

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
second half of the fight I wouldn't

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.879 
second half of the fight I wouldn't
spend<00:04:44.610> any<00:04:44.820> money<00:04:45.060> on<00:04:45.270> Mayweather<00:04:45.840> by<00:04:46.110> KO<00:04:46.500> in

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
spend any money on Mayweather by KO in

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.300 
spend any money on Mayweather by KO in
the<00:04:47.550> first<00:04:47.820> six<00:04:48.150> rounds<00:04:48.720> right<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.860> if<00:04:50.010> you're

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
the first six rounds right so if you're

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.510 
the first six rounds right so if you're
a<00:04:50.580> prop<00:04:51.180> better<00:04:51.780> write<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:52.889> subset<00:04:53.460> of

some entertaining props I believe Ortiz

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.210 
some entertaining props I believe Ortiz
only<00:04:59.550> Ortiz<00:04:59.970> has<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.720> shot<00:05:01.020> at<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.229> KO<00:05:01.440> early<00:05:02.010> I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
only Ortiz has a shot at a KO early I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.860 
only Ortiz has a shot at a KO early I
think<00:05:02.970> since<00:05:03.150> you're<00:05:03.360> getting<00:05:03.660> such

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
think since you're getting such

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.170 
think since you're getting such
compelling<00:05:04.470> odds<00:05:04.919> on<00:05:05.280> Ortiz<00:05:05.700> he's<00:05:05.940> still<00:05:06.150> a

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
compelling odds on Ortiz he's still a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.659

greater<00:05:06.450> than<00:05:06.660> 421<00:05:07.110> underdog<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.919> think<00:05:08.580> you

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
greater than 421 underdog I think you

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.029 
greater than 421 underdog I think you
necessarily<00:05:08.789> need<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.780> have<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:09.990> bet<00:05:10.320> on<00:05:10.530> either

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
KO if you take Ortiz by KO you're

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.360
