00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.079
 a year ago 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.919

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.349

 I'm going to work 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.200
 in such an adverse moment 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 the career they hold at eight career points 17 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.730
 you're going to put the nickname 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.840
 at the point as if you were to knit niemeyer 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.810

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 It lasted little in my life. 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 tunis 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.510

 now I'll accept with 11 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:28.659
 with 18 more points 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.879
 and then you will start here in career 18 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.999
 the points though always let go 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.919
 so here's how you look inside 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.519
 it's a sock 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.719
 7 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.630
 it was good 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.660
 in the middle this typical common explained 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.229
 I can let it fall 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.819
 I Love 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.739
 in the ad 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.739
 Sunday 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.899
 in the last five years 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:01.989
 very well 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.620
 I have in my career 18 so what is this career? 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.399
 was here 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.899
 the trip I do not have on me yet because I came so far now it has to increase 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.849
 8 points 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.309
 so my son 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:20.859
 Why can this start? 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.029
 at the beginning 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.369
 I still do not care 18 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.549
 even if I have turned work they would be acting as if nothing abnormal 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.959
 but not because I still have to do what I want so 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.219
 It's a gift for him. 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.159
 the place was to gather as these knit the spot with a sock 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.369
 pulled 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.309
 it's a chimney 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 and put her clothes on the record 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.989
 continues 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.989
 a year before 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.719
 irons 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.309
 with many 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 4 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.809
 Yes they 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.059
 only with what they had 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.229
 for very little 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.659
 8 point 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.199
 the record you go 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.830
 make the career and 19 because these eight points beijing had career 18 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.379
 these points here 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.689
 are the mounting points 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.930
 now yes you start day 9 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.409
 The sport then leave always mine then this one here will be mine 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.270
 like the one that is the opposite and the peak 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.849
 in stocking 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.479
 7 was thus 1 million 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.599
 c'est chic 8 half 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.330
 who illegally draw their basketball team 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.659
 this one 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.659
 It was still agreed that it is a very dusty career powrite 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.550
 The British squads are against the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.120
 right to work, right? 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.589
 so leave a critical point 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.339
 also from that carreirinha click here will have another dog 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:45.830
 comply with the here 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.289
 Ivory Coast 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.249
 the last five 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.249
 because you increased the eight points on each side 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.309
 Did you see him fascinate me? 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:57.289
