can see this reed in the video there um
a<00:00:10.670> lot<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> times<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.269> buy<00:00:12.420> boxes<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.290> reeds

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
a lot of times if you buy boxes of reeds

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.470 
a lot of times if you buy boxes of reeds
maybe<00:00:15.020> four<00:00:16.020> out<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> ten<00:00:16.740> reeds<00:00:17.070> work<00:00:17.730> maybe

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
maybe four out of ten reeds work maybe

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
maybe four out of ten reeds work maybe
even<00:00:18.810> three<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> here's<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.910> couple<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> tips<00:00:21.330> on

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
even three so here's a couple of tips on

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.620 
even three so here's a couple of tips on
maybe<00:00:22.470> getting<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.310> few<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.449> would

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
maybe getting a few of them that would

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.099 
maybe getting a few of them that would
not<00:00:24.930> normally<00:00:25.230> work<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.099> work<00:00:26.340> okay<00:00:26.900> at<00:00:27.900> least

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
not normally work to work okay at least

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.669 
not normally work to work okay at least
for<00:00:28.939> practicing<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:31.289> being

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
for practicing or or just being

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
for practicing or or just being
economical<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> things<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.899> are

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
economical about the things they are

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.220 
economical about the things they are
fairly<00:00:34.890> expensive<00:00:35.399> these<00:00:35.700> days

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
fairly expensive these days

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.139 
fairly expensive these days
so<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.680> take<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.910> look<00:00:39.059> at

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so if you just take if you just look at

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.799 
so if you just take if you just look at
this<00:00:39.300> Reed<00:00:40.129> it's<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.460> sides<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.059> it's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this Reed it's got two sides to it it's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.430 
this Reed it's got two sides to it it's
got<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.079> flat<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> times

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
got this flat side and a lot of times

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920 
got this flat side and a lot of times
what<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.219> looking<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> seal

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
what you're looking for is a seal

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.970 
what you're looking for is a seal
between<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:50.309> Reed<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:52.050> mouthpiece<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
between that Reed and the mouthpiece and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.130 
between that Reed and the mouthpiece and
if<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.829> flat<00:00:55.829> part<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> Reed<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.059> not

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
if this flat part of the Reed is not

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
if this flat part of the Reed is not
flat<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> can't<00:00:59.190> create<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.670> seal<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
flat then it can't create a seal on that

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.299 
flat then it can't create a seal on that
mouthpiece<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> redoes<00:01:02.039> n't<00:01:02.160> work

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
mouthpiece and then that redoes n't work

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.630 
mouthpiece and then that redoes n't work
very<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.519> can

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
very well so what you can do is you can

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.240 
very well so what you can do is you can
just<00:01:05.760> take<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> flat<00:01:06.540> flat<00:01:07.470> part<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.920> put<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
just take this flat flat part and put it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
just take this flat flat part and put it
on<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.670> table<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.200> white<00:01:10.470> piece<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
on a table with just a white piece of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
on a table with just a white piece of
paper<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.430> rub<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.500> Reed<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.670> piece<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
paper and rub that Reed on the piece of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.620 
paper and rub that Reed on the piece of
paper<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:17.970> hopefully

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
paper like that and it will hopefully

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.820 
paper like that and it will hopefully
just<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.830> tiniest<00:01:20.430> amount<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
just take off the tiniest amount of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.179 
just take off the tiniest amount of
material<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.070> could<00:01:23.220> even<00:01:23.340> use<00:01:24.320> some<00:01:25.320> super

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
material you could even use some super

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.910 
material you could even use some super
light<00:01:26.430> grit<00:01:26.820> sandpaper<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.710> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
light grit sandpaper just take off just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.480 
light grit sandpaper just take off just
a<00:01:29.070> teeny<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.280> hopefully<00:01:32.280> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
a teeny bit of that and hopefully that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.539 
a teeny bit of that and hopefully that
will<00:01:32.610> create<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.060> seal<00:01:34.100> between<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
will create a seal between this and a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
will create a seal between this and a
mouthpiece<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.000> little<00:01:36.329> bit<00:01:36.479> better<00:01:36.659> also<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
mouthpiece a little bit better also you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.090 
mouthpiece a little bit better also you
can<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.509> even<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> reed<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
can just even if you want if the reed is

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.069 
can just even if you want if the reed is
too<00:01:41.250> hard<00:01:41.520> take<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> sandpaper

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
too hard take a little bit of sandpaper

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
too hard take a little bit of sandpaper
or<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:43.920> regular<00:01:44.340> white<00:01:44.579> paper<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
or you can just regular white paper and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.819 
or you can just regular white paper and
just<00:01:47.360> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> lightly<00:01:50.030> brush<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> top<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
just kind of lightly brush the top of it

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.209 
just kind of lightly brush the top of it
anyway<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.020> idea<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
anyway so that's one idea and then the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
anyway so that's one idea and then the
next<00:01:56.430> idea<00:01:58.850> always<00:01:59.850> lick<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.329> Reed's<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
next idea always lick that Reed's you

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.230 
next idea always lick that Reed's you
can<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.100> seal<00:02:02.490> between<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> Reed<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
can get a good seal between the Reed and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.740 
can get a good seal between the Reed and
the<00:02:03.570> mouthpiece<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:04.380> should<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> able<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.189> just

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the mouthpiece it should be able to just

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.609 
the mouthpiece it should be able to just
stay<00:02:06.750> there

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
stay there

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:17.880 
stay there
so<00:02:08.950> we'll<00:02:09.670> put<00:02:09.879> this<00:02:10.030> ligature<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> here's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
so we'll put this ligature on so here's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.550 
so we'll put this ligature on so here's
the<00:02:18.040> next<00:02:18.430> idea<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.140> in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the next idea that I have for you in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.979 
the next idea that I have for you in
creating<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:21.370> good<00:02:21.879> seal<00:02:22.300> between<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.810> Reed

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
creating a good seal between the Reed

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.470 
creating a good seal between the Reed
and<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.170> mouthpiece<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:24.459> put<00:02:24.730> your<00:02:25.000> read

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and the mouthpiece you can put your read

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:16.220 
hear that
hopefully<00:03:08.829> it'll<00:03:08.980> last<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.700> little<00:03:09.849> bit<00:03:09.940> longer

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:23.020 

yeah<00:03:17.230> well<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.799> kind<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.100> hear<00:03:18.250> it

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.580 

well<00:03:24.030> that's<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.360> idea<00:03:24.660> anyway<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.110> can<00:03:25.350> hear

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
well that's the idea anyway you can hear

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.220 
well that's the idea anyway you can hear
the<00:03:25.710> little<00:03:25.980> popping<00:03:26.520> noise<00:03:26.990> sometimes<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.110> can

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the little popping noise sometimes I can

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.570 
the little popping noise sometimes I can
get<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.860> stay<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.550> for

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
get that thing to stay on there for

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.380 
get that thing to stay on there for
quite<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.150> bit<00:03:30.240> longer<00:03:31.070> anywho<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
quite a bit longer anywho you get the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
quite a bit longer anywho you get the
idea<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.780> should<00:03:34.200> soften<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.800> reed<00:03:34.980> up<00:03:35.250> a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
idea that should soften the reed up a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.210 
idea that should soften the reed up a
little<00:03:35.610> bit<00:03:35.790> too<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.300> make<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> little<00:03:37.920> bit

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
little bit too and make it a little bit

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.760 
little bit too and make it a little bit
easier<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.730> play<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:40.050> other<00:03:40.200> thing<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.590> you

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
easier to play the other thing that you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.040
