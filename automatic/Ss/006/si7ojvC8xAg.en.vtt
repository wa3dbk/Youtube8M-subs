timing that I'm now completing the the

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.490 
timing that I'm now completing the the
first<00:00:18.860> first<00:00:19.699> run<00:00:20.330> of<00:00:20.600> prototypes<00:00:21.199> for<00:00:21.380> the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
first first run of prototypes for the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.220 
first first run of prototypes for the
Jedi<00:00:21.800> holocron<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:22.670> this<00:00:23.449> is<00:00:23.810> what<00:00:23.960> its<00:00:24.080> gonna

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
Jedi holocron and this is what its gonna

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.109 
Jedi holocron and this is what its gonna
look<00:00:24.320> like<00:00:24.440> of<00:00:25.070> some<00:00:25.340> really<00:00:25.550> nice<00:00:25.699> photos

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
look like of some really nice photos

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:26.920 
look like of some really nice photos
coming<00:00:26.359> up<00:00:26.510> soon

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
coming up soon

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.710 
coming up soon
it<00:00:27.410> weighs<00:00:28.010> twice<00:00:28.460> where<00:00:28.910> the<00:00:29.000> Sith<00:00:29.210> holocron

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
it weighs twice where the Sith holocron

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.970 
it weighs twice where the Sith holocron
did<00:00:29.900> just<00:00:30.050> because<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.470> amount<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.770> glass

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
did just because the amount of glass

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.729 
did just because the amount of glass
involved<00:00:31.730> it's<00:00:31.880> an<00:00:31.970> optical<00:00:32.239> grade<00:00:32.739> acrylic

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
involved it's an optical grade acrylic

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.130 
involved it's an optical grade acrylic
essentially<00:00:34.309> glass<00:00:34.550> with<00:00:35.179> acrylic<00:00:35.569> sides<00:00:35.839> as

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
essentially glass with acrylic sides as

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.469 
essentially glass with acrylic sides as
opposed<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.739> earth<00:00:37.729> one<00:00:37.879> which<00:00:38.030> had<00:00:38.179> metal

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:38.479 
opposed to the earth one which had metal

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.689 
opposed to the earth one which had metal
sides<00:00:38.749> so<00:00:39.440> it's<00:00:39.589> not<00:00:39.710> as<00:00:39.979> probably<00:00:40.460> not<00:00:40.609> as

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
sides so it's not as probably not as

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.329 
sides so it's not as probably not as
durable<00:00:41.210> but<00:00:41.839> initial<00:00:42.530> testing<00:00:42.889> is<00:00:43.010> it's<00:00:43.190> gone

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
durable but initial testing is it's gone

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.520 
durable but initial testing is it's gone
really<00:00:43.519> well<00:00:43.639> it's<00:00:44.539> not<00:00:44.719> meant<00:00:45.049> to<00:00:45.109> be<00:00:45.229> carried

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
really well it's not meant to be carried

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.110 
really well it's not meant to be carried
around<00:00:45.649> in<00:00:45.889> a<00:00:46.010> backpack<00:00:46.190> this<00:00:46.639> is<00:00:46.760> meant<00:00:46.969> to

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
around in a backpack this is meant to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
sit on a shelf and look pretty as with

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.250 
sit on a shelf and look pretty as with
the<00:00:49.850> Sith<00:00:50.059> holocron<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:50.600> can<00:00:50.780> plug<00:00:50.989> it<00:00:51.139> in

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
the Sith holocron you can plug it in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.099 
the Sith holocron you can plug it in
it's<00:00:51.409> kind<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.589> 16<00:00:52.010> gigabyte<00:00:52.489> flash<00:00:52.729> drive<00:00:53.209> now

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
it's kind of 16 gigabyte flash drive now

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.349 
it's kind of 16 gigabyte flash drive now
this<00:00:54.229> one<00:00:54.379> lights<00:00:54.559> up<00:00:54.709> blue<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.190> I'll<00:00:56.149> show

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
this one lights up blue and I'll show

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.459 
this one lights up blue and I'll show
you<00:00:56.389> a<00:00:56.510> little<00:00:56.749> bit<00:00:56.839> of<00:00:56.870> what<00:00:57.049> that<00:00:57.079> looks<00:00:57.409> like

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.889 
you a little bit of what that looks like
so<00:00:57.620> when<00:00:57.799> you<00:00:57.829> plug<00:00:58.039> in<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.659> cable<00:00:59.659> that<00:00:59.749> comes

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
so when you plug in the cable that comes

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.469 
so when you plug in the cable that comes
with<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:01.190> get<00:01:01.339> access<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.760> 16<00:01:02.449> gigabytes

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
with it you get access to 16 gigabytes

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.960 
with it you get access to 16 gigabytes
of<00:01:02.929> storage<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:03.350> could<00:01:03.619> store<00:01:03.920> your<00:01:04.220> game

whatever you want on there um 16
gigabytes<00:01:09.260> is<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.410> fair<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:09.890> could<00:01:10.250> have

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
gigabytes is a fair bit I could have

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.980 
gigabytes is a fair bit I could have
gone<00:01:10.550> higher<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:11.450> then<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:11.780> would<00:01:11.870> have

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
gone higher but then that would have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.050 
gone higher but then that would have
raised<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.320> price<00:01:12.590> of<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.890> holocron<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.550> I'm

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
raised the price of the holocron and I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.760 
raised the price of the holocron and I'm
trying<00:01:14.300> to<00:01:14.390> keep<00:01:14.480> these<00:01:14.690> things<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.050> close<00:01:15.530> to

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
trying to keep these things as close to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.730 
trying to keep these things as close to
200<00:01:16.160> bucks<00:01:16.310> as<00:01:16.490> possible<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.500> last

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
200 bucks as possible this is the last

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.840 
200 bucks as possible this is the last
of<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.730> test<00:01:19.970> runs<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.260> I<00:01:21.710> did<00:01:22.220> three

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
of the the test runs that I did three

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.910 
of the the test runs that I did three
different<00:01:22.940> designs<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:24.380> chose<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.800> one

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
different designs and I chose the one

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.260 
different designs and I chose the one
that<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:25.100> like<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.400> best<00:01:25.610> which<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.090> blue
