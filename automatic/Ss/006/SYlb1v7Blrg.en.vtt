know the graphic chipset on this one but

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
know the graphic chipset on this one but
anyways<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.890> also<00:00:44.399> understood<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.180> few

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
anyways I also understood show you a few

anyways I also understood show you a few
little<00:00:45.570> things<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.440> how<00:00:46.829> they

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
little things about how they how they

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.970 
little things about how they how they
run<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:48.000> amazing<00:00:48.350> they<00:00:49.350> run<00:00:49.649> quicker

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
run it's pretty amazing they run quicker

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.049 
run it's pretty amazing they run quicker
than<00:00:50.160> anything<00:00:50.820> did<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.710> XP<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.739> Vista<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
than anything did in XP or Vista so you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.220 
than anything did in XP or Vista so you
can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.570> actually<00:00:54.660> running<00:00:54.870> arrow

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
can see this was actually running arrow

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
can see this was actually running arrow
which<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> amazing<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> could<00:00:56.879> not

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
which is amazing because it could not

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.990 
which is amazing because it could not
run<00:00:57.300> arrow<00:00:57.680> in<00:00:59.420> vista<00:01:01.730> alright<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.879> we're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
run arrow in vista alright so we're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.979 
run arrow in vista alright so we're
going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> shut<00:01:03.870> these

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
going to do we're going to shut these

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to do we're going to shut these
both<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> boot<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.820> test<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> we

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
both down and do a boot up test so we

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.670 
both down and do a boot up test so we
can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.560> how<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.830> both<00:01:08.040> respond<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.680> then

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can see how they both respond and then

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.830 
can see how they both respond and then
we'll<00:01:10.770> go<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.450> shut<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.570> boats

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
we'll go from there shut these boats

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.600 
we'll go from there shut these boats
down

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:37.400 

compact<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.810 

there's<00:01:38.410> one<00:01:38.440> thing<00:01:38.920> about<00:01:38.980> Windows<00:01:39.490> 7<00:01:39.730> it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
there's one thing about Windows 7 it

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.950 
there's one thing about Windows 7 it
does<00:01:39.940> take<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.120> little<00:01:40.450> bit<00:01:40.570> longer<00:01:40.810> than

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
does take a little bit longer than

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.350 
does take a little bit longer than
normal<00:01:41.020> shutdown<00:01:41.320> but<00:01:42.070> hey<00:01:42.430> for<00:01:43.180> all<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
normal shutdown but hey for all the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.510 
normal shutdown but hey for all the
extra<00:01:43.600> speed<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.050> can<00:01:44.230> definitely<00:01:44.350> deal<00:01:45.250> with

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
extra speed I can definitely deal with

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.800 
extra speed I can definitely deal with
having<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:46.030> bishop<00:01:46.270> tenders<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.540> little<00:01:46.720> bit

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
having a bishop tenders a little bit

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
having a bishop tenders a little bit
slower<00:01:47.020> than<00:01:47.230> normal<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.820> not<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> problem

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
slower than normal that is not a problem

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.490 
slower than normal that is not a problem
all<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.210> forget<00:01:52.840> these<00:01:53.020> boats<00:01:53.170> are<00:01:53.290> at<00:01:53.410> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
all right forget these boats are at the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.490 
all right forget these boats are at the
same<00:01:53.650> time<00:01:53.860> we'll<00:01:54.370> see<00:01:54.580> if<00:01:54.640> good<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.390> about<00:01:55.600> that

artists<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:53.560> comment<00:02:54.560> shouldn't<00:02:54.800> be<00:02:54.860> too

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
artists up the comment shouldn't be too

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.300 
artists up the comment shouldn't be too
far<00:02:55.070> behind<00:02:56.080> right<00:02:57.080> there<00:02:57.290> people<00:02:57.950> start<00:02:58.250> up

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
far behind right there people start up

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.350 
far behind right there people start up
and<00:02:58.550> maybe<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.270> know<00:02:59.650> 25<00:03:00.650> 35<00:03:01.040> seconds<00:03:01.520> which

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and maybe you know 25 35 seconds which

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.730 
and maybe you know 25 35 seconds which
is<00:03:02.480> incredible<00:03:02.930> because<00:03:02.990> it<00:03:03.290> took<00:03:03.560> about<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
is incredible because it took about a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.260 
is incredible because it took about a
minute<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.310> half<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.850> vista<00:03:05.810> sp1<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:07.270> nice

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
to use exactly what it starts up

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.820 
to use exactly what it starts up
nothing's<00:03:15.200> frozen<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:16.460> works<00:03:16.700> as<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:18.740> can

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
nothing's frozen just works as you can

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
chipset they couldn't even run you can

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.420 
chipset they couldn't even run you can

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.050 

all<00:04:18.910> right<00:04:19.000> what<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.389> got<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.600> compaq<00:04:21.060> course

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
all right what you got the compaq course

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.650 
all right what you got the compaq course
copy<00:04:22.270> doesn't<00:04:22.600> run<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.810> quite<00:04:23.080> as<00:04:23.229> well<00:04:23.410> as<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
copy doesn't run it quite as well as the

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.980 
copy doesn't run it quite as well as the
toshiba<00:04:26.139> because<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.500> is<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.620> lot<00:04:26.889> older<00:04:27.990> but

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
toshiba because it is a lot older but

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.420 
toshiba because it is a lot older but
this<00:04:29.259> is<00:04:29.410> about<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.860> performance<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.310> could

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
this is about the performance you could

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.360 
this is about the performance you could
expect<00:04:30.729> out<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.270> five<00:04:32.259> year<00:04:32.470> old<00:04:32.560> laptop

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
expect out of a five year old laptop

expect out of a five year old laptop
aura<00:04:33.669> or<00:04:34.830> netbook

course<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.759> chipset<00:05:03.149> is<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:03.539> old<00:05:03.779> but

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:04.849 
course the chipset is just so old but

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.279 
course the chipset is just so old but
for<00:05:05.849> a<00:05:05.879> five<00:05:06.149> year<00:05:06.300> old<00:05:06.330> laptop<00:05:06.809> to<00:05:06.990> be<00:05:07.080> able<00:05:07.229> to
