nuketown map is not set up for that at

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.389 
nuketown map is not set up for that at
all<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> know<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:01.829> constructed

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
all you know it's not well constructed

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.850 
all you know it's not well constructed
for<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> zombies<00:01:03.690> map<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.290> something<00:01:04.739> has

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
for to be a zombies map so something has

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.380 
for to be a zombies map so something has
to<00:01:05.010> happen<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.400> certain<00:01:05.700> event<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.150> something

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to happen a certain event or something

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.899 
to happen a certain event or something
to<00:01:07.200> allow<00:01:07.380> charak<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> manipulate<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> map<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to allow charak to manipulate the map to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
to allow charak to manipulate the map to
fit<00:01:09.090> zombies<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> more<00:01:09.840> effective<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
fit zombies in a more effective way and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
fit zombies in a more effective way and
have<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> theory<00:01:11.340> how<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.790> might<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have a theory how they might do that so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
have a theory how they might do that so
I<00:01:12.750> believe<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> certain<00:01:13.380> event<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:13.979> was

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
I believe that certain event that I was

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100 
I believe that certain event that I was
referring<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.790> nuke<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:15.780> that'd<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
referring to is the nuke now that'd be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.780 
referring to is the nuke now that'd be
easy<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> incorporate<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.340> could<00:01:17.640> see

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
easy to incorporate you know I could see

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
easy to incorporate you know I could see
how<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.150> work<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.990> know<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> nuke

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
how it would work you know and if a nuke

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.109 
how it would work you know and if a nuke
goes<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.340> landscape<00:01:20.759> would<00:01:20.909> change

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
goes off the landscape would change

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.580 
goes off the landscape would change
dramatically<00:01:21.689> buildings<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.380> broken

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
dramatically buildings will be broken

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
dramatically buildings will be broken
down<00:01:22.799> stuff<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.580> fire<00:01:23.850> barriers

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
down stuff would be on fire barriers

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
down stuff would be on fire barriers
will<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.080> destroyed<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.890> flattened<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
will be destroyed and like flattened so

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
will be destroyed and like flattened so
that<00:01:27.150> alone<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.750> check<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> ability

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that alone would give check the ability

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
that alone would give check the ability
to<00:01:28.619> play<00:01:28.829> around<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> map<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.729> bit

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
to play around with the map a little bit

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
to play around with the map a little bit
and<00:01:29.970> adapt<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.810> zombies<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.340> gonna

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and adapt it for zombies but I'm gonna

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
and adapt it for zombies but I'm gonna
take<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.850> theory<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.479> step<00:01:33.720> further<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.320> say

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
take my theory one step further and say

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.370 
take my theory one step further and say
you'll<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.490> playing<00:01:35.759> underground<00:01:36.299> too<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> I

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you'll be playing underground too and I

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
you'll be playing underground too and I
know<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.680> might<00:01:37.890> sound<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.490> weird<00:01:38.549> at

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
know that might sound kind of weird at

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.280 
know that might sound kind of weird at
first<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> nuke

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
first but think about it when a nuke

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
first but think about it when a nuke
goes<00:01:40.320> off<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.890> widely<00:01:41.250> believed<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.180> just

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
goes off it's widely believed and just

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.850 
goes off it's widely believed and just
assumed<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> humans<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.439> forced<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
assumed that humans would be forced to

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.260 
assumed that humans would be forced to
burrow<00:01:44.189> underground<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.909> escape<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
burrow underground to escape the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020 
burrow underground to escape the
radioactive<00:01:45.899> waste<00:01:46.619> line<00:01:46.799> excuse<00:01:47.100> me<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
radioactive waste line excuse me on the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
radioactive waste line excuse me on the
surface<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> people<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.189> trapped

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
surface and people that do get trapped

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.760 
surface and people that do get trapped
up<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> surface<00:01:51.329> turn<00:01:51.869> into<00:01:52.110> mutated

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
up on the surface turn into mutated

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
up on the surface turn into mutated
zombies<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.299> picture<00:01:54.450> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
zombies so you know I can picture this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.209 
zombies so you know I can picture this
starting<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> game<00:01:55.290> underground<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
starting the game underground and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.410 
starting the game underground and
zombies<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.700> trying<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> break<00:01:57.149> into<00:01:57.329> our

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
zombies are trying to break into our

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
zombies are trying to break into our
fort<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:57.990> whatever<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.649> they're<00:01:59.250> taking

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
fort or whatever it is they're taking

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.010 
fort or whatever it is they're taking
over<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> start<00:02:00.540> moving<00:02:00.719> around

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
over so we have to start moving around

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
over so we have to start moving around
finding<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> power-ups<00:02:02.009> finding<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> weapon

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
finding the power-ups finding the weapon

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.639 
finding the power-ups finding the weapon
box<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.090> sooner<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:03.840> later<00:02:03.930> make<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.530> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
box and sooner or later make it up to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.319 
box and sooner or later make it up to
the<00:02:04.770> surface<00:02:04.979> where<00:02:05.369> there's<00:02:05.579> even<00:02:05.759> more<00:02:05.790> map

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the surface where there's even more map

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
the surface where there's even more map
to<00:02:06.540> explore<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.439> me<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to explore to me that's not like a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
to explore to me that's not like a
pretty<00:02:08.310> badass<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> pretty<00:02:09.179> good<00:02:09.360> idea<00:02:09.479> but

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
pretty badass and a pretty good idea but

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.660 
pretty badass and a pretty good idea but
again<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.979> theory<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.550> I'm

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
again this is just a theory what I'm

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.010 
again this is just a theory what I'm
trying<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.030> say<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.480> some

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
trying to say is some

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.390 
trying to say is some
has<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.380> happen<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> map<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.370> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
has to happen with the map for there to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.580 
has to happen with the map for there to
be<00:02:14.490> zombies<00:02:14.910> nuketown<00:02:15.060> layout<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:16.050> not<00:02:16.290> fit

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
be zombies nuketown layout is not fit

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.860 
be zombies nuketown layout is not fit
for<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.920> fun<00:02:17.220> zombies<00:02:17.700> experience<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.750> let<00:02:18.840> me

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
for a fun zombies experience but let me

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.030 
for a fun zombies experience but let me
know<00:02:18.990> what<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.140> guys<00:02:19.260> think<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.800> see<00:02:19.920> my

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
know what you guys think can you see my

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.560 
know what you guys think can you see my
deal<00:02:20.220> being<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.610> reality<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.540> have

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
deal being a reality or do you have

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.270 
deal being a reality or do you have
another<00:02:21.660> one<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.220> agree

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
another one but I think we can all agree

another one but I think we can all agree
on<00:02:23.520> my<00:02:23.760> overall<00:02:24.090> point<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.510> Trek<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.960> gonna

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
on my overall point that Trek is gonna

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.230 
on my overall point that Trek is gonna
do<00:02:25.260> something<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.040> map<00:02:26.280> anyways<00:02:26.970> guys<00:02:27.120> I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
do something to the map anyways guys I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.430 
do something to the map anyways guys I
