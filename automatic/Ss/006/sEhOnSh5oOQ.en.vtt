00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.540
 corn let's put a little salt 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.180
 just a little bit because the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.890

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.980
 Mix 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.260

 So you liked it then let's knead 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.890
 thus adding the water little by little to 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.590
 that is very very good, gentlemen, if you 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.960
 it does not have chicharrón pressed like the one that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.960
