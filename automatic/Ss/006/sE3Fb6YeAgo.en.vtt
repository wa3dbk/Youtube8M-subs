00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040
 this extreme fishing starts at 32 17 like this 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 this starts the competition less than 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 Daniel is part of the red team and is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.450
 the one that is attacking the circuit 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.460
 meanwhile by the team 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.350
 yellow we see andrew kill that's going to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
 do the same at this moment this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.400
 competition of friends in this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.970
 non-controversial competition the previous one that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.949
 he made himself the dragon lord to do 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.949
 movements when I was to neither 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.620
 I agree what a barbarity that was a 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.630
 problem and I guess now 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 when you see this happening in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 particular will happen the same if you are 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.690
 pointing out that the dragon lord you well 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.820
 who knows what he did there is then 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 Daniel that she sinned but now the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.289
 problem is to place in position already 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 then does Daniel meanwhile 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 before he has not yet achieved the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 fishing with the hook is complicated is 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.840
 difficult then we see that danielle base 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.590
 at this time for career while 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 Mr. Enrique receives life 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.290
 and they are going to compete meanwhile andrés 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 already has the cylinder but has to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 put me in position so does the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.640
 man from colombia who has his technique 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.490
 in reverse to be able to come back 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.100
 we see then that seeing this cause 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.110
 meanwhile tiffany's already takes the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.820
 hook and go fishing 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.690
 meanwhile by the team 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.140
 yellow in which it comes next 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.450
 is the teacher the teacher who has been in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
 many had despite the injury or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.100
 discomfort in the knee 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.530
 the yellow team keeps using it and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 enough so that it demonstrates its potential 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 there is the teacher then who 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.550
 he prepares to take the bait she does 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.229
 with a different holding putting 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.420
 thrown over his body 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.000
 maybe for more stability and it seems 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.610
 what's wrong because he fishes quickly 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.490
 the teacher and puts exposure 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.760
 the phrase gives the team the advantage 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.000
 yellow but so fast 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.450
 write down and close the competition 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.950
 the yellows also receive help from 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.510
 this competitor that was also very 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.030
 important in the first test though 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.760
 the yellow team I'm not going to win it was 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.310
 one of those that cut and I think that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.560
 the yellow team wins could be with 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 help from the loved goodbye to me be good 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.000
 performance 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.650
 we are seeing then that wanda bid 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.330
 is replacing marlon because 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.310
 remember that if the game gave the 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.740
 bank and others but still do not have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.990
 Defined team is up to this day 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.820
 in the blue team then bad as 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.270
 we know in the newspaper this hit the 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.480
 knees in the competition and also the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.880
 ankle tells me to call then 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.040
 when he is in charge of competing in the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.140
 time to fish and Ricardo already does it 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.660
 more than the yellow ones has a cylinder 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.910
 puts it in position and the yellow ones 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
 after losing 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.950
 now advances in the competition 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.860
 while wanda then is about to place 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 in that third book very well for him the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.120
 handlebar that achieves it but the samarios 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.640
 are going to see before March the 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.860
 magician care this type of movements 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.450
 can be is worrying for the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.970
 confessions because they are the ones that hurt 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.250
 while we see that the Chinese queen is going to 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.830
 attack the deadly reading but remember 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 that I have a variation with date like this 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.060
 let's see how well the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.370
 China and a competitor with whom 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.220
 it feels reflected you have the other 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.010
 side come that outside that placed the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.260
 china on the blue team but new 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.850
 he returned to the language proficiency by 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.580
 that we are observing 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.780
 the china trying to fish shakira that 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.060
 has improved a lot on the subject of 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.470
 precision in the first seasons that 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.660
 He had concentration problems 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.080
 especially now you see much more 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.780
 sure here a topic of staying calm 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.790
 quiet until the time of fishing 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.400
 even greater tells dennis that he 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.290
 move but weak achieves fishing now 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.780
 have to place this it seems to me that a 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.930
 of the most complicated things we see 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.020
 so that's where it is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.200
 Denis Vista to place in the meantime 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.140
 the Chinese queen gets complicated and the reds 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.630
 now they have the competition advantage of 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.060
 swing frame when we see a team 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.950
 yellow that retakes a red team that 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.590
 come back and so on 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.390
 exactly ramiro take four minutes 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.430
 with two seconds of this competition and 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.560
 the score ties three chimes 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.570
 yellow but now it changes four 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.390
 bells appear scarlet team have 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.100
 the advantage in this last competition in 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 what is the competition or what 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.240
 the opportunity is for the two-time champion 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.980
 name of the construction Daniel that 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.280
 comes in while Monica is still 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.170
 trying to place that extreme fishing 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.720
 let's see who of the two accomplishes 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.830
 doing the best way to mónica 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.010
 trying yet there are now so 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.480
 place that cylinder in the hole let's go 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.430
 to retire in a good way taking advantage 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.980
 that Daniel is also doing his 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.290
 fishing thefts are ahead trying 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.810
 to reverse the situation that has occurred 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.930
 throughout the week since there are three 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.220
 competitors of the scarlet team 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.590
 nominated and mónica manages to do it 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.880
 imposes to give the next bell 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.370
 he has to go back through the circuit 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.950
 meanwhile also it is still 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.870
 trying to fish now if he succeeds 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.790
 do it then you can place the 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.400
 cylinder we have already broken the mark in the 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.190
 five minutes with ten seconds tied 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.530
 the score goes to three and sell it 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.840
 all the turbo to deal with then 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.670
 reach the red team that stays 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.980
 from the city angel managed to fulfill his 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.840
 low mention with speed we are 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.289
 seeing that enrique is in charge of 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.020
 help 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.569
 with the lifeline as part 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.210
 of the yellow team and the opportunity is 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.800
 for cayucos for symphony that goes to 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.779
 try to keep the scarlet team 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.189
 forward this last competence of the 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:52.439
 afternoon of today meanwhile to 3 hill 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.469
 trying to make his putting the marker 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.599
 4 for yellow 5 for 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:59.939
 scarlet ones are kept ahead those of the 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.949
 red team and he was hooked over there 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:04.080
 hook to typhoon and the team is very 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.849
 Attentive to control and to chant that it is in 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.610
 hook so you can continue on the 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:11.490
 competition and we are already reaching the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.529
 6 minutes and so far the team 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.270
 red trying to maintain an advantage 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.639
 time you do not pour andrés gil 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.830
 he quickly also manages to do it here 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.009
 it is complicated to the street here south that 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.469
 is trying while Andrey and moved the 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.689
 cable and that obviously takes away a little 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:30.389
 of control to competitors bell 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:32.909
 yellow the score is tied but 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.249
 typhoon and place that cylinder in the 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.199
 hole and is forced to give the next 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.310
 bell that puts the team back 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.830
 Red 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.240
 and this last fishing day competition 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.490
 valid for 300 points the teacher 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.340
 lizette by the scarlet team 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.010
 who competes for his captain the magician 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.810
 world david with the mission to try 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.630
 keep the scarlet team in front 6 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.490
 minutes with 45 seconds on the scoreboard to 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:02.250
 favor of the red team Juan to see what falls 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.080
 the teacher who tries to do his fishing 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.210
 let's see who can do it first 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.240
 if the red ones stay ahead and 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.040
 attention because we are in the last 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.140
 minute or the time of competition and 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.570
 we see then that the scarlet team 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.770
 in front has six chimes with 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.020
 Regarding your team owner 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.990
 yellow in moments analyze 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.060
 to fish in the meanwhile 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.090
 achieves list also very fast does it 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.530
 now they have to obviously return the 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.360
 competition has an advantage for the 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.920
 Red team due to total performance 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.260
 of the team that could have been much more 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.150
 quick that the yellow team were trying 

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.409
 to recover today all the 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.449
 chime when 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:41.219
 This allows you to be the next denis 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.739
 exit meanwhile on the part of the 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:45.899
 yellow team the one that comes is mister 

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:48.059
 hyde do your job we see it then 

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:51.509
 placed in conditions while 

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:54.269
 Denis arrives at his, gentlemen follow the 

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:56.999

 full speed competition 

00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:01.860

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:10.469
