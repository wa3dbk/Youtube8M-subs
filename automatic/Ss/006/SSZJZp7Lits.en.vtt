disconnect I noticed this has a brand
new<00:00:20.250> alternator<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.300> probably<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.439> done

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
new alternator in it probably was done

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.910 
new alternator in it probably was done
sometime<00:00:23.070> recently<00:00:23.750> the<00:00:24.750> issue<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
sometime recently the issue is going to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
sometime recently the issue is going to
be<00:00:26.010> its<00:00:26.340> original<00:00:26.760> plugs<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> wire<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.630> it's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
be its original plugs and wire so it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
be its original plugs and wire so it's
going<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.019> wind<00:00:28.320> up<00:00:28.500> getting<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> tune-up<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
going to wind up getting a tune-up the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
going to wind up getting a tune-up the
original<00:00:30.390> issue<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.869> caused<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.380> misfire

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
original issue that caused the misfire

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.850 
original issue that caused the misfire
on<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.399> car<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.780> runner<00:00:34.170> control

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
on this car was the runner control

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
on this car was the runner control
runners<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:35.880> kind<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> like<00:00:36.270> old<00:00:36.660> style

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
runners are kind of like old style

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.709 
runners are kind of like old style
chokes<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.309> inside<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> intake<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
chokes they are inside the intake and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
chokes they are inside the intake and
they<00:00:39.809> open<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.350> close<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:41.070> hope<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.670> close

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
they open and close they hope they close

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.610 
they open and close they hope they close
completely<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:42.690> cold<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:44.030> for<00:00:45.620> emissions

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
completely at cold start for emissions

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
completely at cold start for emissions
reasons<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.550> after<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> car<00:00:48.210> warms<00:00:48.539> up

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
reasons and after the car warms up

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
reasons and after the car warms up
they're<00:00:48.960> supposed<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> open<00:00:49.590> completely<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
they're supposed to open completely so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
they're supposed to open completely so
you<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:51.030> good<00:00:51.210> airflow<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.930> part<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you get good airflow it's part of the

air fuel system run by the front oxygen
sensor<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.120> there's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:58.140> rod<00:00:58.430> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
sensor this one there's a little rod it

sensor this one there's a little rod it
goes<00:00:59.640> from<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.270> runner<00:01:00.570> control<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.530> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
goes from the runner control which is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.390 
goes from the runner control which is
this<00:01:01.920> guy<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.640> opens<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> closes<00:01:04.400> these

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this guy here and opens and closes these

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.609 
this guy here and opens and closes these
little<00:01:05.820> flaps<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.200> become

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
little flaps this one has become

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
little flaps this one has become
disconnected<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:09.060> until<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
disconnected in the back until we get it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
disconnected in the back until we get it
taken<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.490> sure<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
taken out we're not sure if it's just a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.359 
taken out we're not sure if it's just a
clip<00:01:13.200> issue<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.890> an<00:01:14.250> actual<00:01:14.580> snapped<00:01:15.210> off<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
clip issue or an actual snapped off the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.469 
clip issue or an actual snapped off the
control<00:01:17.369> issue<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.909> we're<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.330> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
control issue so we're going to have to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.410 
control issue so we're going to have to
disassemble<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.470> find<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.270> tune<00:01:21.270> up

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
disassemble it to find that out tune up

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
disassemble it to find that out tune up
on<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.750> car<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
on this car as you can see because the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
on this car as you can see because the
plugs<00:01:24.150> are<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.650> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
plugs are all the way back there so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
plugs are all the way back there so
we're<00:01:26.340> hoping<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:26.970> enough<00:01:27.240> room<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.720> we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we're hoping we have enough room if we

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
we're hoping we have enough room if we
take<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.009> top<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
take off the the top where the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
take off the the top where the
windshield<00:01:30.659> wiper<00:01:30.810> assembly<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
windshield wiper assembly is and the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.600 
windshield wiper assembly is and the
cabin<00:01:32.220> air<00:01:32.369> filter<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.869> able<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.610> get

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
cabin air filter is to be able to get

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.100 
cabin air filter is to be able to get
the<00:01:35.729> tune-up<00:01:36.030> done<00:01:36.299> otherwise<00:01:36.659> we're<00:01:37.020> going

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the tune-up done otherwise we're going

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
the tune-up done otherwise we're going
to<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.500> remove<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.040> intake<00:01:38.549> which<00:01:39.240> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to have to remove the intake which in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179 
to have to remove the intake which in
our<00:01:39.570> case<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> winds<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:40.590> needing<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> runner

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
our case if it winds up needing a runner

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
our case if it winds up needing a runner
control<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:42.030> probably<00:01:42.540> wind<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.869> having<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
control will probably wind up having to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.700 
control will probably wind up having to
do<00:01:43.409> anyway<00:01:45.229> timewise<00:01:46.229> we're<00:01:46.530> probably

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
do anyway timewise we're probably

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
do anyway timewise we're probably
looking<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.250> four<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:47.909> five<00:01:47.939> hours<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
looking at four or five hours on this
