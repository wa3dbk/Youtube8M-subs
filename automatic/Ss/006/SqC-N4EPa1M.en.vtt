00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
pearl light dent right on the door edge

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
pearl light dent right on the door edge
and<00:00:12.750> right<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.259> front<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.679> edge

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
and right in front of the edge

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.359 
and right in front of the edge
and<00:00:16.850> yeah<00:00:17.850> not<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.240> terrible<00:00:18.570> right<00:00:18.779> yeah<00:00:19.560> it

and yeah not that terrible right yeah it
really<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:22.220> because<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> inner<00:00:23.490> structure

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
really is because the inner structure

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.599 
really is because the inner structure
has<00:00:25.650> been<00:00:25.680> bent<00:00:26.130> pretty<00:00:26.400> good<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> we're<00:00:29.519> gonna

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
has been bent pretty good so we're gonna

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.540 
has been bent pretty good so we're gonna
see<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.269> with<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:31.430> get<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
see what we can do with this get that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.290 
see what we can do with this get that
inner<00:00:32.730> structure<00:00:33.180> pushed<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:35.120> get<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
inner structure pushed back out get that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.180 
inner structure pushed back out get that
edge<00:00:36.450> pushed<00:00:36.780> back<00:00:36.960> out<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.649> repair<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
edge pushed back out and repair that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
edge pushed back out and repair that
dent<00:00:38.489> close<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.750> edge<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.660> touch<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
dent close to the edge and touch up the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.060 
dent close to the edge and touch up the
little<00:00:43.800> scratch<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.379> gonna<00:00:46.500> give<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> few

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
little scratch and I'm gonna give a few

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
little scratch and I'm gonna give a few
free<00:00:47.730> tips<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.899> kinds<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.289> dents

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
free tips here on these kinds of dents

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
free tips here on these kinds of dents
and<00:00:49.860> maybe<00:00:50.640> make<00:00:50.850> our<00:00:51.030> jobs<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.690> bit

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and maybe make our jobs a little bit

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.090 
and maybe make our jobs a little bit

easier make our lives a little bit
easier<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.629> found<00:00:54.899> doing

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
easier from things that I found doing

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.090 
easier from things that I found doing
stuff<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.250> over<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> years<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> too

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
stuff like this over the years so too

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.349 
stuff like this over the years so too
often<00:00:59.460> when<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.050> when<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.820> lock<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.120> side

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
often when we when we lock the back side

often when we when we lock the back side
of<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.629> double<00:01:04.260> panels<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:05.210> we<00:01:06.210> stay<00:01:06.390> in

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of these double panels out we stay in

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.200 
of these double panels out we stay in
one<00:01:06.689> spot<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:08.220> push<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.700> double<00:01:09.030> panel

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
one spot and we push that double panel

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.399 
one spot and we push that double panel
out<00:01:09.450> into<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:11.180> outer<00:01:12.180> panel<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> quickly<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
out into the outer panel to quickly in

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.289 
out into the outer panel to quickly in
one<00:01:13.680> spot<00:01:13.979> instead<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:16.009> series<00:01:17.240> we're<00:01:18.240> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
one spot instead of in a series we're in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
one spot instead of in a series we're in
a<00:01:18.330> line<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:23.000> knocking<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a line so when you are knocking out the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
a line so when you are knocking out the
edges<00:01:24.630> creases<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> edges<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.100> are

in double panels double walls come up
evenly<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> stripe<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.600> have

evenly you see the stripe that I have

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
evenly you see the stripe that I have
there<00:01:31.610> I've<00:01:32.610> hit<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.150> object<00:01:34.400> very

certain area yes I started knocking this
edge<00:02:12.990> out<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.290> knew<00:02:13.620> that's<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.010> needed<00:02:14.280> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
edge out I knew that's what I needed to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.180 
edge out I knew that's what I needed to
do<00:02:14.580> first<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> waited<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.470> started

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
do first but I waited and started
