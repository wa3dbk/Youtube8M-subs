revolution<00:00:16.650> we've<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:16.950> a<00:00:16.980> few<00:00:17.250> questions

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
revolution we've had a few questions

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.210 
revolution we've had a few questions
about<00:00:18.110> runners<00:00:19.110> they<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.560> Hagan<00:00:19.860> start<00:00:20.100> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
about runners they and Hagan start to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
about runners they and Hagan start to
tackle<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.700> and<00:00:20.940> I<00:00:21.300> wanted<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> look<00:00:21.780> at<00:00:21.900> foam

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
tackle that and I wanted to look at foam

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.570 
tackle that and I wanted to look at foam
roller<00:00:22.470> today<00:00:22.860> because<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> runners

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
roller today because a lot of runners

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.970 
roller today because a lot of runners
will<00:00:23.940> already<00:00:24.360> use<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> foam<00:00:25.110> roller<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.770> but

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
will already use a foam roller but but

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.400 
will already use a foam roller but but
what<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.190> see<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.840> oftentimes<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.020> really

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
what I see is oftentimes it's really

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.839 
what I see is oftentimes it's really
good<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.740> understand<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.430> you're<00:00:29.580> trying<00:00:29.700> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
good to understand what you're trying to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
good to understand what you're trying to
achieve<00:00:30.180> with<00:00:30.360> your<00:00:30.390> home<00:00:30.660> roller<00:00:30.900> because

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
achieve with your home roller because

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
achieve with your home roller because
technique<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.189> important<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.180> we'll

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
technique is really important so we'll

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
technique is really important so we'll
just<00:00:33.510> dump<00:00:33.810> grab<00:00:34.110> ang<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.770> we'll<00:00:35.220> get<00:00:35.640> her

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
just dump grab ang and we'll get her

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.710 
just dump grab ang and we'll get her
down<00:00:36.060> if<00:00:36.990> I'm<00:00:37.230> wrong<00:00:37.880> basically<00:00:38.880> with<00:00:39.240> a<00:00:39.270> foam

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
down if I'm wrong basically with a foam

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.810 
down if I'm wrong basically with a foam
roller<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.380> you're<00:00:40.560> trying<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.130> guys<00:00:41.430> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
roller what you're trying to do guys is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
roller what you're trying to do guys is
you're<00:00:41.970> trying<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.450> aware<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.079> your

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you're trying to be aware of your

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.290 
you're trying to be aware of your
anatomy<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> structure<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:45.030> trying

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
anatomy the structure what you're trying

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.080 
anatomy the structure what you're trying
to<00:00:45.390> release<00:00:45.990> so<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.160> two<00:00:47.490> things<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
to release so there's two things that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.820 
to release so there's two things that
you're<00:00:48.210> thinking<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.720> when<00:00:48.990> you're<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
you're thinking of when you're as a

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.830 
you're thinking of when you're as a
runner<00:00:50.220> that<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> try<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> target<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.540> first

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
runner that you try to target the first

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.120 
runner that you try to target the first
thing<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.110> trigger<00:00:52.320> points<00:00:52.710> those<00:00:52.860> little

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
thing your trigger points those little

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.800 
thing your trigger points those little
knots<00:00:53.400> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.790> muscles<00:00:54.150> so<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.630> when

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
knots in the muscles so you know when

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.770 
knots in the muscles so you know when
people<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.410> struggle<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.430> saw<00:00:57.090> saw

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
people really struggle with like saw saw

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.650 
people really struggle with like saw saw
um<00:00:58.170> sections<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> foam<00:00:59.460> roller<00:00:59.510> there<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
um sections on the foam roller there you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.970 
um sections on the foam roller there you
trigger<00:01:00.930> points<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.470> you<00:01:01.560> can<00:01:01.650> start<00:01:01.830> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
trigger points so you can start to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
trigger points so you can start to
understand<00:01:02.400> that<00:01:02.490> map<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.360> second<00:01:03.840> thing

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
understand that map the second thing

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
understand that map the second thing
you'll<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you'll want to know about is that the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.969 
you'll want to know about is that the
connective<00:01:06.330> tissue<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.900> glad<00:01:07.500> wrap<00:01:07.710> around

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
connective tissue the glad wrap around

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.440 
connective tissue the glad wrap around
the<00:01:08.070> muscle<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.759> around<00:01:08.880> red<00:01:09.240> meat

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the muscle you see that around red meat

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.749 
the muscle you see that around red meat
that<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.840> pharmacy<00:01:10.530> type<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> tissue<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.670> if

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
that one pharmacy type of tissue so if

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.429 
that one pharmacy type of tissue so if
you<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> release<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> function

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you want to release that it's a function

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.950 
you want to release that it's a function
of<00:01:13.560> pressure<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.009> time<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.689> elite

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of pressure and time so all about elite

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.779 
of pressure and time so all about elite
runners<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.680> we'll<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> systematic

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
runners what we'll do is a systematic

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.489 
runners what we'll do is a systematic
fashion<00:01:17.969> release<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
fashion release to really start to

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:22.130 
fashion release to really start to
optimize<00:01:20.310> their<00:01:20.549> body<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.969> can<00:01:21.509> approximate

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
optimize their body you can approximate

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.099 
optimize their body you can approximate
that<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:22.679> your<00:01:22.890> give<00:01:23.100> em<00:01:23.280> raw<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.179> and<00:01:24.539> with

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:25.109 
that with your give em raw so and with

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.230 
that with your give em raw so and with
an<00:01:25.229> ITV<00:01:25.619> we're<00:01:26.039> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.219> start<00:01:26.460> high<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:27.179> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
an ITV we're going to start high on a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.069 
an ITV we're going to start high on a
little<00:01:27.840> trigger<00:01:28.079> point<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.679> so<00:01:29.039> basically<00:01:30.079> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
little trigger point so so basically so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.959 
little trigger point so so basically so
enters<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> trigger<00:01:32.069> point<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.759> when

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
enters on a trigger point now so when

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.639 
enters on a trigger point now so when
she's<00:01:33.299> trigger<00:01:33.659> pointing<00:01:34.109> she's<00:01:34.350> trigger

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
she's trigger pointing she's trigger

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.130 
she's trigger pointing she's trigger
pointing<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.670> pressure<00:01:36.359> and<00:01:36.659> she

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pointing so that's a pressure and she

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
pointing so that's a pressure and she
just<00:01:37.289> sits<00:01:37.469> on<00:01:37.649> it<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.270> put<00:01:39.509> pressure

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just sits on it so so you put pressure

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.029 
just sits on it so so you put pressure
on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> trigger<00:01:40.049> point<00:01:40.350> he'll<00:01:40.469> start<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> back

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
on the trigger point he'll start to back

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.120 
on the trigger point he'll start to back
off<00:01:41.069> it'll<00:01:41.490> release<00:01:41.789> then<00:01:42.749> she'll<00:01:43.439> shift<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
off it'll release then she'll shift and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.160 
off it'll release then she'll shift and
start<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> use<00:01:44.609> his<00:01:44.789> special<00:01:45.030> technique<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.840> so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
start to use his special technique so so

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.550 
start to use his special technique so so
slow<00:01:46.889> so<00:01:47.340> deep<00:01:47.880> pressure<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.539> really<00:01:48.749> slow<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
slow so deep pressure and really slow so

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.039 
slow so deep pressure and really slow so
it's<00:01:49.679> a<00:01:49.740> fast<00:01:49.950> release<00:01:50.509> keep<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.659> next<00:01:51.869> point

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it's a fast release keep your next point

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.529 
it's a fast release keep your next point
so<00:01:52.649> next<00:01:53.340> point<00:01:53.639> she's<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> next<00:01:54.359> trigger

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
so next point she's on the next trigger

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.719 
so next point she's on the next trigger
point<00:01:54.719> so<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.049> she's<00:01:55.259> trigger<00:01:55.530> point<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.399> from

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
point so now she's trigger point so from

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.489 
point so now she's trigger point so from
a<00:01:56.819> technical<00:01:57.270> perspective<00:01:57.539> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.109> do<00:01:58.289> this

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
a technical perspective you can do this

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.399 
a technical perspective you can do this
trigger<00:01:58.829> point<00:01:59.329> fairly<00:02:00.329> slow<00:02:00.659> trigger<00:02:01.170> point

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
trigger point fairly slow trigger point

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.279 
trigger point fairly slow trigger point
again<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.429> can<00:02:02.549> go<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.789> again<00:02:03.289> and

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
again and then you can go up again and

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.289 
again and then you can go up again and
they're<00:02:04.709> pretty<00:02:04.950> close<00:02:05.280> together<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
they're pretty close together so you

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
they're pretty close together so you
tell<00:02:06.810> edges<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.499> next<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:07.920> there<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
tell edges on the next one there so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.090 
tell edges on the next one there so
she's<00:02:09.450> picking<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.440> would<00:02:10.860> run<00:02:11.039> right

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
she's picking that up I would run right

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.960 
she's picking that up I would run right
down<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> knee

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
down to the knee

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.150 
down to the knee
and<00:02:13.240> for<00:02:13.600> your<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:14.230> your<00:02:14.260> ITB<00:02:14.920> you're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
and for your for your ITB you're

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.560 
and for your for your ITB you're
thinking<00:02:15.490> about<00:02:15.700> your<00:02:15.880> little<00:02:15.970> nest<00:02:16.300> of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
thinking about your little nest of

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.060 
thinking about your little nest of
trigger<00:02:16.810> points<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.350> from<00:02:17.650> your<00:02:17.830> map

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
trigger points so from your map

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.770 
trigger points so from your map
perspective<00:02:18.730> as<00:02:18.850> an<00:02:19.000> intelligent<00:02:19.570> runner

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
perspective as an intelligent runner

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.600 
perspective as an intelligent runner
you're<00:02:20.320> aware<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> little<00:02:21.070> nest<00:02:21.340> high

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
you're aware of the little nest high

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.850 
you're aware of the little nest high
then<00:02:22.240> there's<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.570> real<00:02:22.810> nasty<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.560> nest

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
then there's a real nasty little nest

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.520 
then there's a real nasty little nest
halfway<00:02:24.340> down<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.790> then<00:02:24.850> there's<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:26.110> just

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
halfway down and then there's one just

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.170 
halfway down and then there's one just
above<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.010> knee<00:02:27.190> there's<00:02:27.640> also<00:02:27.850> little

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
above the knee there's also little

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.640 
above the knee there's also little
sensitive<00:02:28.660> ones<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.960> between<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.470> but

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
sensitive ones in between that but

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.920 
sensitive ones in between that but
they're<00:02:29.800> your<00:02:29.980> primary<00:02:30.460> ones<00:02:30.760> okay<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.810> other

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
they're your primary ones okay the other

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.140 
they're your primary ones okay the other
thing<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> want<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.470> know<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:33.310> target<00:02:33.850> with

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
thing you want to know your target with

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
thing you want to know your target with
your<00:02:34.200> your<00:02:35.200> runners<00:02:35.500> knee<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.190> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
your your runners knee is that you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.700 
your your runners knee is that you
basically<00:02:36.580> don't<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.210> to<00:02:37.270> just<00:02:37.420> do<00:02:37.570> ITP<00:02:37.960> you

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
basically don't want to just do ITP you

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.560 
basically don't want to just do ITP you
want<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.950> start<00:02:39.220> instead<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.850> expanding<00:02:40.330> your

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
want to start instead of expanding your

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.630 
want to start instead of expanding your
search<00:02:40.960> so<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> would<00:02:41.980> usually<00:02:42.220> do<00:02:42.520> your

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
search so I would usually do your

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.610 
search so I would usually do your
lateral<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:43.240> anterolateral<00:02:43.840> posture<00:02:44.560> a

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lateral I do anterolateral posture a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.230 
lateral I do anterolateral posture a
lateral<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.250> starting<00:02:45.700> sort<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.000> front

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
lateral so starting sort of the front

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.830 
lateral so starting sort of the front
front<00:02:47.020> come<00:02:47.350> outside<00:02:48.040> quarter<00:02:48.580> sit<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.660> she's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
front come outside quarter sit so she's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.840 
front come outside quarter sit so she's
gonna<00:02:49.990> start<00:02:50.230> high<00:02:50.440> again<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.040> she's<00:02:51.670> just

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
gonna start high again and she's just

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.340 
gonna start high again and she's just
rolling<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.630> trigger<00:02:53.590> point<00:02:54.780> sit<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.140> and

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
rolling in trigger point sit on that and

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.870 
rolling in trigger point sit on that and
then<00:02:56.530> slowly<00:02:56.950> roll<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.700> facial<00:02:58.390> release<00:02:58.770> and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
then slowly roll up facial release and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.280 
then slowly roll up facial release and
then<00:03:00.880> trigger<00:03:01.120> point<00:03:01.360> again<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:01.750> she's<00:03:01.930> still

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
then trigger point again so she's still

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.840 
then trigger point again so she's still
putting<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.770> map<00:03:03.070> together<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.640> head

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
putting that map together in a head

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.220 
putting that map together in a head
she's<00:03:04.060> becoming<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.540> smarter<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.020> smarter

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
she's becoming a smarter and smarter

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470 
she's becoming a smarter and smarter
athlete<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.190> she'll<00:03:06.400> roll<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:07.150> some

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
athlete so she'll roll this some

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.690 
athlete so she'll roll this some
anterolateral<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.350> front<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.130> outside

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
anterolateral the front so outside

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.340 
anterolateral the front so outside
quarter<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.300> then<00:03:10.660> we'll<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:10.959> tip<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.200> back

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
quarter and then we'll just tip you back

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.060 
quarter and then we'll just tip you back
edge<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:13.320> we're<00:03:14.320> going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.500> get<00:03:14.590> this<00:03:14.709> posture

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
edge and we're going to get this posture

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.680 
edge and we're going to get this posture
a<00:03:15.130> lateral<00:03:15.490> that's<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:15.880> fat<00:03:16.180> outside

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
a lateral that's that fat outside

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.330 
a lateral that's that fat outside
quarter<00:03:16.959> through<00:03:17.140> there<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.650> again

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
quarter through there so again

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.050 
quarter through there so again
trigger<00:03:18.730> pull<00:03:18.940> your<00:03:19.890> okay<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.220> roll<00:03:21.910> it

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
trigger pull your okay and roll it

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.280 
trigger pull your okay and roll it
through<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.570> other<00:03:22.660> thing<00:03:22.900> with<00:03:23.019> your<00:03:23.110> foam

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
through the other thing with your foam

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.440 
through the other thing with your foam
roller<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.920> what's<00:03:24.280> your<00:03:24.430> pressure<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.239> see

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
roller is what's your pressure so see

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.360 
roller is what's your pressure so see
how<00:03:25.660> how<00:03:26.080> ang<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.530> really<00:03:26.830> guiding<00:03:27.160> pressure

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
how how ang is really guiding pressure

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.060 
how how ang is really guiding pressure
with<00:03:27.580> that<00:03:27.790> arm<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.239> then<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.140> leg<00:03:29.470> see<00:03:29.950> if

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
with that arm and then this leg see if

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.830 
with that arm and then this leg see if
she<00:03:30.190> needs<00:03:30.370> more<00:03:30.670> pressure<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.600> can<00:03:31.720> actually

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
she needs more pressure you can actually

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.780 
she needs more pressure you can actually
take<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.290> off<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.890> get<00:03:36.070> really<00:03:36.580> pretty

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
take that off so you get really pretty

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.060 
take that off so you get really pretty
intense<00:03:37.209> force<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.870> really<00:03:38.410> back<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.920> off

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
intense force you can really back it off
