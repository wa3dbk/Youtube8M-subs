00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello and welcome tsum 15 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.830
 days trend for Germany and also for 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.559
 schmid feasible on the glee fanny 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.349
 chmelar in the extreme north of germany 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.599
 where you see or suspect denmark 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.850
 at least so sylt and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.100
 Nordfriesland in general the Baltic Sea island 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.390
 hiddensee and also reprimand it will be there 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.010
 more or less easy coming 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 winter is not far away 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.539
 from zero degrees away in between 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.380
 Snow falls a little less groppy 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.489
 further direction south hamburg but man 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 already sees that it is here 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.440
 longtime average we stay as 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 in hamburg more or less until 23 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 march is below average then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.789
 It's a short break but you see 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.610
 the huge uncertainty is between 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.219
 still animal cold and light in the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.140
 spring still everything in there so there 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.660
 it is still not quite out what 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 He passes the cold or the warm 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 Variant continues to be over 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.449
 twitter j underlined tachelmann or 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.539
 facebook tachelmann weather of course 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.360
 kept up to date 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.860
 that's the situation for frankfurt for 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 the middle of germany in general 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 you can see we are here in record cold 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.360
 areas now recover us 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.860
 coming days usually means the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.509
 Temperatures that are also typical for 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.220
 German the middle so in the next 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.890
 days come the week so three to eight 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.110
 Grad is always rainy weather 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.490
 not a great thing can be great 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 but are always early in the morning 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 average and then between the 19 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.400
 and on the 21st of March, this relapse 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.439
 in below-average temperatures 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 and next to it to see here 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.740
 the possibility that it around the 23 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.020
 march times a bit warmer than 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.909
 last much warmer even and then 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.939
 afterwards again the gigantic big one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.930
 uncertainty 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.610
 two-digit temperatures actually 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 I had hoped that here still Munich 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.670
 comes the zÃ¼rich comes that is also 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.590
 Well 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.210
 So I'm going to stop right now 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.070
 Swiss German but that is also true 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.799
 generally for the south of germany 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 you see it looks a bit like this 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.990
 vernal also ever 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 next week in the average 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.239
 area then come here, too, the crisis 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.400
 to lift 19 and in the 21st march the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.130
 best chances for spring weather times 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.600
 shortly at the 23rd 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.440
 and then later here too 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.170
 gigantic uncertainty so from 23 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.100
 march you know nothing really so nothing 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.930
 all now calls 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.060
 Swiss German is very short it is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.900
 unfortunately so that snow is waiting in the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 flatland once over and it is one 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.790
 script the stuhrer but it stops 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 now nine ships between Danube again 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.770
 top but as I said at the really 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.420
 maybe two degrees maybe even 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.730
 about whether the metric improves in 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.390
 april box still bite but again 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.450
 fast 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.460
 So it is certainly not yet 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.560
 but certainly dissipates spring 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.090
 start that with the coarsest one 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.470
 the snow but by a nice 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.760
 a nice weekend and weeks 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 Bye bye in many places
