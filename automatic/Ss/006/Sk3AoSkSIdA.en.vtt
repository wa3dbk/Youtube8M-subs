00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello everyone and welcome to my channel 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.359
 dedicated to dynamic modeling I am 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.480
 i sum and he and stefano the creator of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.040
 goblin he takes care of the fuselages 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 we've already seen it in another video 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 today what you show us if I tell you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.670
 the goblin 700 that stacy edition this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.670
 has not yet come out this will be on 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.900
 market and in two weeks then 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.660
 presumably around June 15th 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 perfect ok then I leave you now with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.579
 stefano who gives you all the explanations e 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.660
 I'll be behind the camera 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.610
 eventually I will ask you questions from 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 behind cameras thanks to this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.649
 goblin 700 was developed in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 collaboration with cai themselves 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.910
 at this time our pilot of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 tip one of the best in the world 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 surely we could define it a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.579
 super globules 700 basically 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.770
 based on the structure of the goblin 700 ma 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.649
 it is equipped with all possible upgrades 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.270
 and imaginable facts to illustrate you 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.160
 some things 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.710
 first of all the body is completely in 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.040
 carbon facts you already see is a carbon 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.390
 edition the visible carbon is on the tube 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.530
 of tail that on the canopy 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.650
 this basically one 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.080
 aesthetic and lightness feature 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.590
 another thing that varies from the goblin 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.970
 standard is this special cart that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.920
 allows for frame slipping 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.610
 it allows to do maneuvers too 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.890
 we would call it upgrade enough 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.690
 normally but on the sort of shaun it is 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.300
 already supplied 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.900
 the key thing about this 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.590
 helicopter is however the rotor head 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.190
 is a three-bladed rotor head with each blade 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.600
 independent on separate spindle e 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.290
 then it gives these helicopters 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.240
 speed and agility skills 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.460
 impressive same speech applies to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.150
 the tail rotor is supplied with 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 tail blade rotor and with a slide 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.210
 control in cut aluminum 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.330
 numerical control this equipment 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.160
 gives a thing you mean cut 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.590
 numerical control is not a piece is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.330
 printed in plastic but with a pesto in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.010
 aluminum I did to control with 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.040
 then numerical control machines 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.800
 the three-blade tail rotor is very precise 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 confers exceptional governability 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.260
 from the point of view of the rotations of the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.030
 stop 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.920
 let's go to open helicopter to do 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
 see also that which the production 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.299
 internal and we see that supplied 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 we already supply the darling gear 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.900
 which provides excellent support qualities 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.129
 power and at the same time excellent qualities 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.480
 of silence and smoothness with 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.489
 the helicopter so open you can 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.370
 appreciate that fact that the parties in 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.470
 aluminum in sight such as flat head 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.230
 cyclic mixer and tail rotor 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.329
 They are anodized black color this 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.430
 provides that aggression that 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.290
 we wanted to give this helicopter because 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 when he would try to see things that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.670
 it really is a super helicopter 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.590
 what 's special about this type is broken 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.599
 the others this is the meeting and you can 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.930
 compare this helicopter because 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:13.000
 I say so-so incomparable 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.090
 heard in comparing them to then 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.879
 does not know that I have devised a channel error 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.430
 in Italy it is not really correct wanting 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.430
 no let's say I also respect the goblins 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.650
 precedents in particular of blade 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.510
 manageability and speed of 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.489
 maneuver are really incredible 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.189
 this feature is basically 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 due to the three-headed head 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:40.159
 tripala adds a third practically 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.150
 of albi pana speed everyone is wondering 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:47.900
 the tribal better than the ball is better that way 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.379
 I thought before talking to you 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.329
 I really thought it was one 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.250
 only a question of beauty 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.989
 actually you confirmed something to me 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.909
 to which I had not thought because I have 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.950
 said okay instead of the triple one you can 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.560
 enlarge the fa patrol is explained 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.010
 one thing because the tripala because it has one 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.430
 greater or faster reaction 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.709
 compared to the pala then undoubtedly 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.209
 the aesthetic doctor is already a very thing 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.370
 interesting because it presents itself 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.190
 really so very very much 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.050
 nice speed qualities are due 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.530
 to the fact that we normally have the 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.990
 bipal clearly has a 180 ball 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.630
 degrees compared to each other as i 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 helicopter movements are dictated 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.860
 from the cyclic plate that is this 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.229
 little object that you see here that everyone 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.030
 known for environment we have i 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.840
 movements are taken cyclically 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.699
 on the 180 degree blade in fact or one 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.280
 however at 120 degrees from the plate 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.430
 but at 180 with respect to the blade 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.010
 the trip always comes first because every 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.710
 ball is at 120 degrees to the other 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.020
 so every command comes before here 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.780
 also the need on flyers systems of 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.820
 reduce agility because using a 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.590
 tripala with the same equipment 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.450
 electronic or in any case ourselves if 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.760
 stage of a bipal you really find yourself 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.730
 with an almost ungovernable high 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.250
 and fast 3d pilots this 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.810
 they prepare in an incredible way because 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.050
 figures that can be obtained with 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.680
 other shovels today really are 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.700
 impressive publicity of the 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.550
 speed of action 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.580
 the speech of the 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.320
 noiselessness of the triple blade thanks to the fact 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.240
 that we have three shovels is possible 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.710
 normally make extremely figures 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.560
 fast at a rotation speed 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.890
 lower rotor than the bipal 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.100
 also the rope and the tip from the blade 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.479
 it favors the flight life science therefore 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.870
 overall helicopter will appear 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:53.249
 much faster but very quiet 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.359
 thanks to all thanks to stefano 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:56.359
 see you next time
