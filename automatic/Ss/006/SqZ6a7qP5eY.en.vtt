00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:44.400 
three sides of your pillow all the way
across<00:00:24.410> making<00:00:25.410> sure<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.340> flat

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
and what I like to do before I stitch it

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.650 
and what I like to do before I stitch it
is<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.830> actually<00:00:47.980> take<00:00:48.400> my<00:00:48.580> pillow<00:00:48.940> insert<00:00:49.420> and

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
line it up and see in this case my

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.120 
line it up and see in this case my
pillow<00:00:52.930> ended<00:00:53.290> up<00:00:53.410> being<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.710> little<00:00:53.950> bit

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
pillow ended up being a little bit

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.270 
pillow ended up being a little bit
smaller<00:00:54.610> than<00:00:55.210> my<00:00:55.840> fabric<00:00:56.380> of<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.800> pillow<00:00:57.010> so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
smaller than my fabric of the pillow so

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.680 
smaller than my fabric of the pillow so
I'm<00:00:57.580> just<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:57.910> do<00:00:58.090> a<00:00:58.120> bigger<00:00:58.360> seam

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690

allowance<00:00:59.170> in<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.440> case<00:00:59.620> I'll<00:00:59.800> do<00:00:59.980> about<00:01:00.250> an

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
allowance in this case I'll do about an

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.250 
allowance in this case I'll do about an
inch<00:01:00.880> seam<00:01:01.120> allowance<00:01:01.570> all<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.810> way<00:01:01.930> around

inch seam allowance all the way around

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.010 
inch seam allowance all the way around
and<00:01:02.710> then<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.130> should<00:01:03.310> work<00:01:03.430> out<00:01:03.610> perfectly

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
and then it should work out perfectly

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.210 
and then it should work out perfectly
take<00:01:05.020> it<00:01:05.140> to<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.350> machine<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.920> you're<00:01:06.190> ready
