00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.840
 so this with these devices 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.359
 I can now 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.179
 do great things 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.179
 and again the x-bow PR 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.970
 With that, the couple saw it 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.240
 and that all over 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 paint circular shape in the election 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 just over a second 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.280
 and you can see that now the scammers easy 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.290
 m 1 in front 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.200
 Of course, the whole thing can also be done 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 also been moved live 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.820
 you can tell perfect from the 11 one more power 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.340
 you can feel that way 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.670
 putting together a wonderfully marginalized by saying okay 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.860
 high 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 Money is not there is already displayed okay 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 Namco Bo anyway 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.510
 I could also value this here Â» 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.800
 so taxes 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.620
 our thought 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.620
 that he will be my sequence 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 then by this effect 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 Show Mr. 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 and can do that now 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.000
 Join Cham ShoreTel Tor 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
 and to use that Max Maier has to do a new show 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.900
 Eagle newer 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 Add a trace to Nettekoven's objects 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.870
 and then 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.489
 we would have those here 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.610
 she adjoins the just ordered if one clicks harder 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.559
 you pull the whole here 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.609
 Points each Bayer poses were 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.609
 and I imagine that better again 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.699
 Manner Morf plans 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.389
 this window is just 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.109
 very important because from here 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.359
 that will be the individual kyu points and wonderfully configured 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.239
 I'll do that 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.239
 and you measure again in the library 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:48.309
 Okan so that not only bears the same name 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
 there really on the sequence to tilt properties 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.859
 and 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.249
 can do some things in the settings of the sequence this repeats 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 shall be 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.209
 whether the channels should be reset afterwards then 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.849
 or not 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.730
 that's what makes them pretty good at ESI Quensen for smoke machines, for example 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.689
 because these are controlled automatically 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.309
 through a sequence 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.010
 give it all afterwards 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.220
 Mergner can be disturbed further 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.379
 because they were not reset by the sequence 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.789
 in that case, that stuff is back to me 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:38.629
 the great thing about it is also the stops and crashed stop the error results 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.219
 for each sequence it is created 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.369
 from here you can control or stop the internal command of the program 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.129
 gross mistakes 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.139
 tie back the shot or and what external things to head for 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.770
 There are many possibilities that you can do with the program 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.770
 good pm 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.479
 Children would be excused o 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.989
 and the tens cloths 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.989
 Renamed file 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:12.329
 I have mine here now 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.519
 she made cramps 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.049
 through Corteo say smoke "I do not want anyone 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.930
 Sequence over the effect 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.610
 to represent more accurately but Daisy Heidrich create because you can say 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.620
 okay foolish Ohligs the border bridge object 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.349
 If you click it acts as affected was still nothing separate 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.809
 Battlestar create points here 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.080
 and from here construction work 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.490
 which one makes these points Orwell the million 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.740
 May now I go here 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.740
 in the blender 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.879
 and whom he just gives her 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.879
 the points from the Stor two wants 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.520
 this means the numbers are red that means 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.330
 the backbone programmed a cluster 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.240
 and so you can get any value 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.650
 wonderful programming because I can only say okay 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.499
 I will describe all the words like that 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.740
 then the programming applies to all theaters 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.879
 I had also said Janka 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:28.879
 I give the device control 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.870
 I put something here 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.870
 I could have 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.430
 and then these are points 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:46.229
 programmed the same way you can see the five years 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.199
 here 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.999
 all over 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.330
 Grote 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 if you go through the ZBU doors 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.449
 you can see that the programming in the device control 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.889
 was acquired
