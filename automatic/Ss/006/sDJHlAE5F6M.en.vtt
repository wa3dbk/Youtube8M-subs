00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.870
 me 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.849
 how 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.870
 hello everyone and his dogues get 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.000
 find today for a new 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.930
 video a little bit special since 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.180
 I would like to talk to you a little bit about 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.040
 project I had in mind to know if that 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.970
 would you like it if I could continue to 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.550
 the advanced precisely then so here we get 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.189
 found on google's homepage 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.599
 street view which is what allows you 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.790
 for example when you go on google 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.290
 maps you can visit for example 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.700
 your neighborhood since to a car that 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.280
 has passed who photographed precisely 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.170
 send photographs here in 360 ° of 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.390
 your neighborhood and that allows you in 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 simply visualize everything 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.780
 simply neighborhood where the world goes in 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.070
 done since there are a lot of things that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.539
 have been photographed yes here we can get 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.339
 moving in is so I currently 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.780
 am in terminale s and we make cures 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.239
 so sm says computer sciences 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.739
 digital and in it's healthy we had a 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.899
 project which consisted precisely 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.179
 exploit this street view engine in 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.260
 javascript to be able to do some 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.950
 other thing for example the visit 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.440
 virtual of our high school I thought that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.120
 we could do the same thing from 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.070
 photos that were not taken with 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.540
 for example if you see valid 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.370
 google sphere apps actually who 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.870
 allows with android phones 2 2 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.250
 take your device to watch everything 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.480
 around you and to do just one 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 panoramic picture like that and of 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.690
 display it on on your android and I 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.270
 I thought we could do the same 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.730
 thing using two-stage cinema 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.470
 4d in cinema 4d we call it actually 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.030
 a hdr so 1 hr dr is something 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.400
 who comes to his record and all around 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.600
 the scene a spherical photo of 360 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 degrees that gets posted all around 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
 of the scene and that will allow us in 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.830
 just made to have the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 reflections of objects that are not in 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.080
 our salt in fact so we can go 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.270
 search here in the media libraries of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.150
 4d cinema we must certainly find 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.770
 therefore this HDR example here is 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.300
 an example of hdr that I found in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.470
 the 4d movie library actually 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.240
 it's a photo that will take over a 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.500
 360-degree environment that you 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.300
 see that it's a little deformity 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.680
 little weird that if we applied it this 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.020
 do that will take the environment back to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.790
 360 degrees so these are things that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.690
 are useful in 4d cinema and I 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 I said we could use 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.950
 precisely the hdr of cinema 4d to create 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.230
 ourselves and then be able to 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.640
 integrate in street view and soul 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.250
 came up with the idea of ​​making a little game 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 interactive actually using 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.310
 the street view engine we used in 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.570
 dot little google api and is to do 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.420
 of all that makes it a little game 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.910
 interactive in the minecraft universe 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.050
 in an internet browser or on 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.570
 android phone 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.690
 so I started slowly 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.330
 develop it so using hdr I 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.190
 almost shows you it's a hdr extract 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 of cinema cap images that's it by 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.450
 example it is a hdr that I extracted from 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.370
 cinema 4d of mama scene cinema 4d and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.050
 then that I'm going to use it in my 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.750
 motor street view and that will give me 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.760
 just that so in fact here we can 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.950
 take in a street view in full 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.290
 screen and you can move and all 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.239
 around so down and up 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.530
 also here just like in 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.170
 google street view like when you 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.670
 wander and we also have so I have 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.840
 made several and I dress them nke 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.310
 with little arrows you see that 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.280
 if I advance paris actually I 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.739
 found a little further I can 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.030
 move on there to return here I 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.610
 can dream started from here so that's 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.830
 really the basic thing is my 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.000
 basic navigation and then I thought 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.459
 to make a little story 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.680
 why not or a little game where we 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.390
 can walk around find clues 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760
 tell a story why not 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.280
 embed some videos why in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.840
 finish with that kind of mini games a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.239
 little bit interactive like that they 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.470
 would be two on the internet and on the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.959
 android platforms since that we can 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.760
 adapt it on an android platform 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.709
 which here I would like to know what 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.510
 you think of this idea what you 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.590
 think of development and then if you 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.739
 have questions about precisely 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.480
 the code why not there google country 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.250
 good it stops and then especially the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.960
 javascript do not hesitate to 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.460
 let me know I want you 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.580
 explain the 3 tips precisely on this 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.840
 html and javascript so that's so 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.130
 interested do not hesitate to lead 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.260
 it is precisely your suggestions 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.570
 ideas on this little interactive game we 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.520
 could do and why not when 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.190
 I will have finished codesa you give it for 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.290
 that you can have fun 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 with name creating very complicated in just 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.920
 a little trick for me my muse is a 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 little bit to connect precisely cinema 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.470
 4d so all the cinema universes 4d all 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.090
 and hdr with a little bit of the universe of 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.919
 internet programming all that so 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.020
 to make a mix of both here are 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.400
 so do not hesitate to leave me your opinion 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.080
 in the comments and we end up 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.130
 soon for other videos go hi 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.130
 and all tcm knox
