efforts originally I did one poster and

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.050 
efforts originally I did one poster and
I<00:00:32.890> started<00:00:33.160> off<00:00:33.280> with<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.520> first<00:00:33.670> one<00:00:33.820> which

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
I started off with the first one which

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.030 
I started off with the first one which
was<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.239> Lotus<00:00:34.570> one<00:00:34.750> not<00:00:35.590> when<00:00:35.710> I<00:00:35.739> created

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
was the Lotus one not when I created

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.710 
was the Lotus one not when I created
first<00:00:36.370> because<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:36.880> had<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.329> lot<00:00:37.510> of<00:00:37.540> heavy

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
first because I had a lot of heavy

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.840 
first because I had a lot of heavy
symbolism<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.530> has<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.130> lot<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.430> meeting<00:00:39.640> about

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
symbolism and has a lot of meeting about

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.540 
symbolism and has a lot of meeting about
rebirth<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:41.130> compassion<00:00:42.130> which<00:00:42.309> I<00:00:42.399> thought

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
rebirth and compassion which I thought

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.770 
rebirth and compassion which I thought
was<00:00:42.670> really<00:00:42.730> fitting<00:00:43.180> for<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.390> cause<00:00:43.570> because

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
was really fitting for the cause because

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.770 
was really fitting for the cause because
