00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.960
PSA PEUGEOT CITROËN’S
AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.200
Hello. Today we are at
the PSA Peugeot Citroën test centre

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.920
to present to you
a new and helpful driving system:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.360
automated driving.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.760
Here we are in a vehicle that is equipped
with the automated driving system.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400
So we’re going on to a fast lane.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.640
The system asks me if I want to
switch to the automated driving mode.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.080
So I press the confirmation button.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
And off we go.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.480
The system automatically pilots
the engine, the directions and the brakes

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.400
so I can let go of the wheel and
I don’t have to touch the pedals,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.880
as the system does it all for me.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520
It is a simple and intuitive system

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.600
and I can take control of
the vehicle at any moment.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.920
Thanks to GPS
and mapping systems we are able

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.040
to receive the information about
the road that we are driving along,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.360
Such as the bends and the steepness
of the road, and the speed limit.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.520
This information allows the vehicle
to be constantly updated of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.440
the legal speed limit

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.280
so that it can adjust
its speed if necessary.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.360
For example, the system announced
that a sharp bend is 100 metres ahead

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.040
so the vehicle slows itself down
in order to safely turn the corner.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.320
The vehicle sensors inform the system of
any surrounding vehicles and objects.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.760
So, if a slow vehicle is detected
on the same road as me

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.720
and it is preventing me
from following the legal speed limit

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.480
the system will ask me
if I would like to overtake it,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.400
which I will confirm
by flashing my indicators.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.640
The system does
the overtaking maneuver by itself.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.040
It also tells me if there is enough
room to pull back in, after overtaking.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.680
As soon as I want,
I can initiate the maneuver.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.520
The idea is to introduce
a new automated system

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.560
that will take on tedious driving tasks

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.760
such as long journeys or traffic jams,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.120
in order to limit the driver’s tiredness.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.400
As soon as I leave the fast lane,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.080
the system will ask me to stop
automated driving, if it knows my route,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.880
or I can signal at any moment that
I am going to stop it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.800
and then take control of
the steering wheel and the pedals again.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.520
The system needs regulatory development

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.600
in order to allow the driver to take
their hands off the steering wheel.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.440
Once this this problem is solved

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.000
It will be the first step towards
automated driving for PSA Peugeot Citroen.
