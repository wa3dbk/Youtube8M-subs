jets they say this plane is like nothing

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.569 
jets they say this plane is like nothing
they've<00:00:38.219> ever<00:00:38.430> flown<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> plane<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.309> unique

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
they've ever flown the plane is unique

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
they've ever flown the plane is unique
because<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.149> puts<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.600> fires<00:00:42.989> quickly<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
because it puts out fires quickly and

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.569 
because it puts out fires quickly and
efficiently

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
efficiently

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.190 
efficiently
I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> jet<00:00:45.420> has<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> great<00:00:45.960> future

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
I think the jet has a great future

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
I think the jet has a great future
because<00:00:46.950> fighting<00:00:47.370> fires<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.910> becoming<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because fighting fires is becoming a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.600 
because fighting fires is becoming a
global<00:00:48.510> issue<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> demands<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.280> using

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
global issue so the demands of using

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
global issue so the demands of using
these<00:00:50.820> type<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.809> only<00:00:51.930> keep

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
these type of thing will only keep

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.330 
these type of thing will only keep
growing<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:55.440> fascinated<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.370> his<00:00:56.730> job<00:00:58.340> have

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
growing is fascinated by his job have

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
growing is fascinated by his job have
been<00:00:59.520> flying<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> plane<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.480> four<00:01:00.660> years<00:01:00.899> now

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
been flying the plane for four years now

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
been flying the plane for four years now
and<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> chose<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.489> work<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and the reason I chose to work with it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
and the reason I chose to work with it
is<00:01:03.120> because<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.899> no<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.320> plane<00:01:04.739> like

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
is because there is no other plane like

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
is because there is no other plane like
this<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> world<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.970> such<00:01:06.299> class<00:01:06.630> such
