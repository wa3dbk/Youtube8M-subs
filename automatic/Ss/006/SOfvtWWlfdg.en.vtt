00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.350
 here is the first compact in history 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.390
 of skoda she is called fast space bac 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 is derived from his cousin the fast 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.850
 so what are his strengths his 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.529
 weak points what status 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.560
 she claims we see that all of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560
 after 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.150
 the new space waves to fill the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 empty that there was in the skoda range 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.689
 between fabia and octavia so for 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.300
 to make it simple it is a skoda 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.610
 faster than one to 20 cm and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 which we grafted a hatchback and yes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.149
 just here skoda was inspired 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.250
 of his first cousin the a3 sportback 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 to get out something pretty 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 roomy then at the line level 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.890
 obviously it stays pretty much everywhere 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.730
 but it's timeless and this is wanted 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.379
 by skoda 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 so to finish she measures 4 meters 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.890
 30 and enters into full competition with 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.199
 the stars of the category 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.940
 the peugeot 308 the renault megan the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.710
 citroën c4 but be careful here the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.440
 philosophy is a different hair 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 since skoda wants to stay very aggressive 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 here the leveling and from the bottom we want 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 really seduce the customer who has 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 not the means to buy real 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 compact and those who hesitate with a 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.380
 versatile as usual here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.380
 skoda straddles two categories 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.270
 when you're on a skoda on 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 expects to have space and 7 space 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.080
 dax do not betray the genes of the brand 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 since habitability is one of the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.049
 best of the category whether at 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.280
 leg level 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.960
 I made a big jig 1 I can 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.950
 you say it from the head or shoulders 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.350
 we are really comfortable 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.970
 a small flat on the third 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.520
 passage and that he will have life a little 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.799
 harder let's continue with the interior 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.509
 this is a fast skoda layout 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.280
 with exactly the same dashboard 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.930
 so its austere but it has the merit 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 to be pretty well finished as to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 equipment we have everything that is done to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 the current time in terms of comfort 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.500
 for all that is a bit high 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 tech will have to turn to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.829
 cousins ​​of the volkswagen group 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.659
 we think of the 3 golf is there the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.000
 men to finish let's talk about the volume 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 of trunk which is located at 4 115 liters 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.950
 in other words one of the records of his 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950
 segment 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.800
 welcome aboard this new space 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.140
 ferry that I remind you is based on 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.490
 a platform of rapids then for the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.110
 little story it's an assemblage 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.410
 old parts of the group volkswagen 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.730
 with old skoda models as a result 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.440
 driving something not 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.180
 frankly exceptional but not 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.500
 bad either in the end we have 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.600
 the impression of driving a 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.570
 sedan from the early 2000s the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.940
 security besides so that remains some 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.250
 rational thing just like his 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.760
 engines that for once they are 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.610
 modern 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.050
 in essence we have tsi engines in 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.060
 diesel 2 tdi 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.700
 today our trial version 90 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.740
 horses is largely sufficient to fill the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 job of the compact we have something 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.210
 pleasant to use that do not consume 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.380
 too much that can be a bonus associated with 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.480
 a box dsg 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.740
 So, overall well it was worth the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.740
 money but not more 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.769
 skoda take advantage of the fast to pull 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.760
 a compact sedan then on the paper 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.360
 we might fear 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.129
 consequences 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.780
 but in reality it is not 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.700
 since we are dealing with a car all 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.709
 actually correct to start with his 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.079
 tariffs since it starts at 17 miles 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.829
 euros count 19 thousand euros for 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.569
 diesel access 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.010
 as for the benefits we like 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.659
 especially volumes to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.220
 provision whether it be places 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.480
 back or chest volume 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.609
 now regarding driving 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.170
 for sure we do not reach the leaders 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.359
 of the category but we are dealing with a 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.430
 safe and comfortable car 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.980
 so to those looking for a car 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 rational with a rational budget 7 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.340
 space tray is for you the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.549
 marketing will take place from 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.549
 November
