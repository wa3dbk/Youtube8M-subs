00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
beginning we focus most of our attention

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.389 
beginning we focus most of our attention
on<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.900> footwork<00:00:41.320> what<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.860> lower<00:00:42.010> part<00:00:42.339> of

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
on the footwork what the lower part of

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.200 
on the footwork what the lower part of
the<00:00:42.460> body<00:00:42.579> is<00:00:42.850> doing

the body is doing
we<00:00:43.960> don't<00:00:44.260> put<00:00:44.440> as<00:00:44.530> much<00:00:44.649> emphasis<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.309> what

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
we don't put as much emphasis on what

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.000 
we don't put as much emphasis on what
happens<00:00:45.940> with<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.300> arms<00:00:46.629> or<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.839> ball<00:00:47.019> we<00:00:47.860> get

now they need to learn when to approach
the<00:01:00.699> volleyball<00:01:00.969> if<00:01:01.329> there's<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.629> lot<00:01:01.839> of<00:01:01.870> depth

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
the volleyball if there's a lot of depth

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.619 
the volleyball if there's a lot of depth
perception<00:01:02.219> involved<00:01:03.219> with<00:01:03.339> volleyball<00:01:03.629> with

the volleyball be enough eight nine feet
in<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.580> air<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:07.179> hardest<00:01:07.509> part<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:07.750> them

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
in the air the hardest part for them

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.900 
in the air the hardest part for them
right<00:01:08.170> now<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.710> learn<00:01:08.890> when<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.220> leave<00:01:09.640> and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
right now is to learn when to leave and

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.150 
right now is to learn when to leave and
when<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.630> jump<00:01:10.899> for<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.229> ball<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:12.009> what

when to jump for that ball and what

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.529 
when to jump for that ball and what
you'll<00:01:12.340> find<00:01:12.369> is<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.090> lot<00:01:13.240> of<00:01:13.330> them<00:01:13.450> are

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
you'll find is that a lot of them are

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.050 
you'll find is that a lot of them are
jumping<00:01:13.899> under<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.320> or<00:01:14.440> behind<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.979> so<00:01:15.909> what

jumping under it or behind it so what

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.490 
jumping under it or behind it so what
we're<00:01:16.179> trying<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.420> do<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:16.720> get<00:01:16.899> them<00:01:17.080> used<00:01:17.320> to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
we're trying to do is get them used to

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.160 
we're trying to do is get them used to
setting<00:01:18.250> high<00:01:18.490> volleyballs

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

and attacking from behind the ball we
want<00:01:23.349> them<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.500> jump<00:01:23.709> behind<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.099> ball<00:01:24.310> so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
they leave we wanted to lead with a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.940 
they leave we wanted to lead with a
strong<00:01:31.179> left<00:01:31.630> if<00:01:31.899> their<00:01:32.259> right<00:01:32.470> hand<00:01:32.679> hit<00:01:32.830> or

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
strong left if their right hand hit or

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.229 
strong left if their right hand hit or
we<00:01:33.039> want<00:01:33.250> them<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.369> lead<00:01:33.610> with<00:01:33.849> the<00:01:33.880> left

we want them to lead with the left

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.330 
we want them to lead with the left
that's<00:01:34.479> their<00:01:34.690> biggest<00:01:34.899> step<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:36.099> last

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
that's their biggest step and the last

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.889 
that's their biggest step and the last
two<00:01:36.520> steps<00:01:36.759> are<00:01:37.030> just<00:01:37.209> to<00:01:37.330> kind<00:01:37.509> of<00:01:37.630> get<00:01:37.750> that

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
two steps are just to kind of get that

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.630 
two steps are just to kind of get that
final<00:01:38.349> adjustment<00:01:38.890> behind<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.280> ball

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
final adjustment behind the ball

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.639 
final adjustment behind the ball
we<00:01:40.450> need<00:01:40.599> them<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.840> land<00:01:41.080> with<00:01:41.349> their<00:01:41.470> knees

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
we need them to land with their knees

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.440 
we need them to land with their knees
bent<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.130> they<00:01:42.250> jump<00:01:42.489> straight<00:01:42.789> up<00:01:42.849> behind<00:01:43.330> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
bent so they jump straight up behind the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.119 
bent so they jump straight up behind the
ball<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.929> then<00:01:44.200> they<00:01:44.319> just<00:01:44.530> swing<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:45.099> a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:45.129 
ball and then they just swing with a

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.559 
ball and then they just swing with a
strong<00:01:45.550> follow-through<00:01:46.239> there<00:01:46.840> are<00:01:46.989> so<00:01:47.530> many

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
strong follow-through there are so many

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.510 
strong follow-through there are so many
variables<00:01:49.569> in<00:01:50.170> an<00:01:50.410> approach<00:01:50.800> how<00:01:51.280> do<00:01:51.340> you

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
variables in an approach how do you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520 
variables in an approach how do you
break<00:01:51.819> it<00:01:52.030> down<00:01:52.209> into<00:01:52.569> teaching<00:01:52.869> elements

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
break it down into teaching elements

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050 
break it down into teaching elements
that<00:01:53.649> they<00:01:53.770> can<00:01:53.950> understand<00:01:54.429> well<00:01:54.910> there's

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
that they can understand well there's

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.059 
that they can understand well there's
two<00:01:55.509> two<00:01:55.869> schools<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.379> thought<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.709> one

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
two two schools of thought on that one

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.219 
two two schools of thought on that one
is<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.459> one<00:01:57.879> is<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.179> break<00:01:58.360> down<00:01:58.539> each<00:01:58.599> part<00:01:59.170> of

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
is to one is to break down each part of

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.339 
is to one is to break down each part of
the<00:01:59.349> attack<00:01:59.649> which<00:01:59.920> is<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.250> approach<00:02:01.349> the

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
the attack which is the approach the

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.979 
the attack which is the approach the
jump<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:02.860> then<00:02:03.069> what<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.459> arms<00:02:04.060> do<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.690> swing

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:04.989 
jump and then what the arms do the swing

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.350 
jump and then what the arms do the swing
and<00:02:05.229> there's<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.979> other<00:02:06.099> school<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.610> says<00:02:06.849> do

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
and there's the other school it says do

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.729 
and there's the other school it says do
not<00:02:07.390> break<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.899> down<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.259> way<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.560> teach

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
not break it down that way and teach

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.760 
not break it down that way and teach
them<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.910> skill<00:02:10.179> all<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.569> once<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.709> the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
them the skill all at once I'm of the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.800 
them the skill all at once I'm of the
opinion<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.430> use<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.640> mix<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.120> both<00:02:13.239> I<00:02:13.510> actually

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
opinion I use a mix of both I actually

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.570 
opinion I use a mix of both I actually
will<00:02:14.200> break<00:02:14.410> down<00:02:14.440> parts<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
will break down parts of it like the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.240 
will break down parts of it like the
approach<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.209> then<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.140> will<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.920> put<00:02:18.160> them

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
approach and then I will I will put them

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.920 
approach and then I will I will put them
up<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.550> platform<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.360> let<00:02:19.660> them<00:02:19.780> work

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
up on a platform and just let them work

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.199 
up on a platform and just let them work
on<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> upper<00:02:20.470> body<00:02:20.500> arm<00:02:20.980> swing<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.580> then

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
on the upper body arm swing and then

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.729 
on the upper body arm swing and then
we'll<00:02:22.390> we'll<00:02:22.810> take<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.260> we'll<00:02:23.319> put<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.680> all

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
we'll we'll take it and we'll put it all

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.440 
we'll we'll take it and we'll put it all
together<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.340> they<00:02:24.400> get<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.580> chance<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:25.000> try<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
together so they get a chance to try and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.190 
together so they get a chance to try and
tie<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.660> all<00:02:25.930> three<00:02:26.650> steps<00:02:26.890> together

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
tie it all three steps together

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.930 
tie it all three steps together
with<00:02:29.200> your<00:02:29.470> smaller<00:02:29.950> girls<00:02:30.340> on<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> team<00:02:30.880> that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
with your smaller girls on the team that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.960 
with your smaller girls on the team that

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
can't jump above the net what do you do

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.460 
can't jump above the net what do you do
with<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.630> teach<00:02:34.810> them<00:02:35.020> correct

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
with them to teach them correct

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.590 
with them to teach them correct
mechanics<00:02:36.160> knowing<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> they<00:02:37.240> can't<00:02:37.450> get

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the ball if they choose not to jump we

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.330 
the ball if they choose not to jump we
we're<00:02:46.090> encouraging<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.870> strong<00:02:47.230> wrist<00:02:47.590> snap<00:02:47.860> if

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
we're encouraging a strong wrist snap if

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.370 
we're encouraging a strong wrist snap if
they<00:02:48.850> hit<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.150> ball<00:02:49.300> hard<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> wrist<00:02:50.140> snap

they hit the ball hard with a wrist snap

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.380 
they hit the ball hard with a wrist snap
they'll<00:02:50.830> actually<00:02:51.040> spin<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.670> ball<00:02:51.819> down<00:02:52.090> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
they'll actually spin the ball down and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.330 
they'll actually spin the ball down and
a<00:02:52.840> lot<00:02:52.989> of<00:02:53.020> times<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.500> will<00:02:53.530> roll<00:02:53.800> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.069> court

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
a lot of times it will roll on the court

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
a lot of times it will roll on the court
and<00:02:54.489> that's<00:02:54.640> an<00:02:54.760> effective<00:02:55.180> attack<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:57.330> see<00:02:58.330> a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and that's an effective attack I see a

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.080 
and that's an effective attack I see a
few<00:02:58.750> hitting<00:02:59.650> with<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.920> fist<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.519> then<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.820> see

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
few hitting with the fist and then I see

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.880 
few hitting with the fist and then I see
the<00:03:01.450> majority<00:03:01.750> hitting<00:03:02.140> with<00:03:02.230> an<00:03:02.350> open<00:03:02.650> hand

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the majority hitting with an open hand

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.979 
the majority hitting with an open hand
what<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.790> proper<00:03:04.209> technique<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.900> you

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
what is the proper technique that you

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.590 
what is the proper technique that you
teach<00:03:05.260> when<00:03:05.860> teaching<00:03:06.640> hitting<00:03:07.090> at<00:03:07.239> this<00:03:07.450> age

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
teach when teaching hitting at this age

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.750 
teach when teaching hitting at this age
well<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:08.200> try<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.769> encourage<00:03:08.950> an<00:03:09.340> open<00:03:09.580> hand

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
well we try and encourage an open hand

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.490 
well we try and encourage an open hand
we<00:03:09.850> teach<00:03:10.060> an<00:03:10.209> open<00:03:10.480> hand<00:03:10.660> approach<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.320> tell

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
we teach an open hand approach and tell

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.340 
we teach an open hand approach and tell
them<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.739> save<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.130> fist<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.610> beach<00:03:13.350> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
them to save the fist for the beach the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.780 
them to save the fist for the beach the
open<00:03:14.620> hand<00:03:14.830> gives<00:03:15.040> them<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.220> chance<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.550> move

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
open hand gives them a chance to move

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.250 
open hand gives them a chance to move
the<00:03:15.940> ball<00:03:16.120> around<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.540> court<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.019> they<00:03:17.110> can

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
the ball around the court and they can

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.620 
the ball around the court and they can
put<00:03:17.470> topspin<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.160> ball<00:03:18.280> by<00:03:19.209> hitting<00:03:19.450> on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
put topspin on the ball by hitting on

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.330 
put topspin on the ball by hitting on
top<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.110> ball<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.530> rolling<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.100> hand

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
top of the ball and rolling the hand

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.720 
top of the ball and rolling the hand
over<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:21.819> an<00:03:22.540> open<00:03:22.870> hand<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.319> what<00:03:23.890> we<00:03:24.040> we

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
over so an open hand is what we we

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.040 
over so an open hand is what we we
believe<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.300> proper<00:03:25.630> way<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.780> hit<00:03:26.019> a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
believe is the proper way to hit a

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.559 
believe is the proper way to hit a
volleyball<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:27.370> see<00:03:27.640> them<00:03:27.850> walking<00:03:28.030> over<00:03:28.360> to

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
volleyball we see them walking over to

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.479 
volleyball we see them walking over to
the<00:03:28.630> computer<00:03:29.140> after<00:03:29.319> they<00:03:29.950> go<00:03:30.100> through<00:03:30.130> the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
drill what is what's involved there in

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.970 
drill what is what's involved there in
the<00:03:33.010> practice<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.880> we<00:03:33.970> are<00:03:34.120> using<00:03:34.299> Dartfish

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
the practice well we are using Dartfish

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
the practice well we are using Dartfish
software<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.880> have<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.360> delay<00:03:37.660> mode

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
software and we have it in a delay mode

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.430 
software and we have it in a delay mode
right<00:03:38.049> now

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
right now

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440 
right now
which<00:03:38.590> means<00:03:38.860> that<00:03:39.310> 10<00:03:39.850> seconds<00:03:40.269> after

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
which means that 10 seconds after

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.229 
which means that 10 seconds after
they've<00:03:40.930> made<00:03:41.350> their<00:03:41.590> attack<00:03:41.850> they<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:43.060> come

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
they've made their attack they can come

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.940 
they've made their attack they can come
around<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.840> take<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.049> look<00:03:44.170> at<00:03:44.440> what<00:03:44.560> they<00:03:44.709> just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
around and take a look at what they just

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.759 
around and take a look at what they just
did<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.850> normally<00:03:46.810> we<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.110> coach<00:03:47.380> standing

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
did so normally we have a coach standing

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.710 
did so normally we have a coach standing
there<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:48.040> talk<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.250> them<00:03:48.489> about<00:03:48.670> what<00:03:49.570> they

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
there to talk to them about what they

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.530 
there to talk to them about what they
saw<00:03:49.959> when<00:03:50.620> you're<00:03:50.739> designing<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:51.280> practice<00:03:51.760> how

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
saw when you're designing a practice how

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.990 
saw when you're designing a practice how
do<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.810> decide<00:03:53.079> what<00:03:53.320> drills<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.950> use<00:03:54.160> at<00:03:54.579> this

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
do you decide what drills to use at this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.660 
do you decide what drills to use at this
age<00:03:55.180> group<00:03:55.530> well<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.560> have<00:03:56.769> three<00:03:57.160> things<00:03:57.489> that

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
age group well I have three things that

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.550 
age group well I have three things that
we<00:03:57.910> must<00:03:58.150> teach<00:03:58.420> him<00:03:58.570> at<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.870> level<00:03:59.230> one<00:03:59.530> of

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
we must teach him at this level one of

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.039 
we must teach him at this level one of
them<00:03:59.799> is<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.070> forearm<00:04:00.459> pass<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:01.570> second<00:04:01.930> is

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
them is the forearm pass the second is

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.690 
them is the forearm pass the second is
to<00:04:02.200> be<00:04:02.230> able<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.590> pass<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:03.010> ball<00:04:03.220> over<00:04:03.549> their

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
to be able to pass that ball over their

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.910 
to be able to pass that ball over their
head<00:04:03.910> like<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:04.150> setter<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> third<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.799> to

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
head like a setter and the third is to

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.349 
head like a setter and the third is to
be<00:04:05.950> able<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.340> get<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.519> serve<00:04:06.790> over<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> net

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
be able to get a serve over the net

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.060 
be able to get a serve over the net
without<00:04:07.900> those<00:04:08.200> three<00:04:08.380> things<00:04:08.709> we<00:04:08.890> really

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
without those three things we really

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.319 
without those three things we really
don't<00:04:09.160> have<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.370> volleyball<00:04:09.700> game<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.239> we

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
don't have a volleyball game and we

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.780 
don't have a volleyball game and we
found<00:04:10.570> that<00:04:10.780> if<00:04:11.650> we<00:04:11.709> can<00:04:12.010> master<00:04:12.370> those<00:04:12.549> three

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
found that if we can master those three

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.819 
found that if we can master those three
the<00:04:12.940> frustration<00:04:13.510> level<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:14.019> their<00:04:14.200> their

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
the frustration level and their their

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.949 
the frustration level and their their
more<00:04:15.400> than<00:04:15.519> likely<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.970> stay<00:04:16.239> involved<00:04:16.780> with

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
more than likely to stay involved with

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.229 
more than likely to stay involved with
the<00:04:17.049> sport<00:04:17.410> longer<00:04:17.919> we<00:04:18.579> can<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:18.910> get<00:04:19.030> those

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the sport longer we can just get those

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.120 
the sport longer we can just get those
things<00:04:19.450> out<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> way<00:04:19.959> great<00:04:20.680> all<00:04:21.010> right

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130
