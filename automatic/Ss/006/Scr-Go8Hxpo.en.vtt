just<00:00:42.149> show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.200> simple<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.590> taking

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
just show you it's as simple as taking

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680 
just show you it's as simple as taking
an<00:00:44.100> apple<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:45.090> want<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.660> sure

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
an apple that well want to make sure

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.709 
an apple that well want to make sure
that<00:00:45.930> Apple<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.469> sit<00:00:46.920> by<00:00:47.160> itself<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.969> sit

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that Apple will sit by itself and sit

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
that Apple will sit by itself and sit
upright<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.710> doesn't<00:00:50.010> roll<00:00:50.129> around<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
upright so it doesn't roll around on the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
upright so it doesn't roll around on the
table<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.270> obvious<00:00:51.660> reasons<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
table for obvious reasons this one is

that I've just placed a votive candle on
the<00:00:58.559> top<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.609> used<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.969> pen<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the top and I used a pen just to go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.399 
the top and I used a pen just to go
around<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.649> score<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> exact<00:01:03.480> diameter<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
around and score the exact diameter of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
around and score the exact diameter of
it<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> circle<00:01:05.820> there<00:01:06.320> now

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it and you can see that circle there now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
it and you can see that circle there now
it's<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.740> matter<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> taking<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.880> little

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it's just a matter of taking a little

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.780 
it's just a matter of taking a little
paring<00:01:09.720> knife<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.229> cutting<00:01:10.710> directly<00:01:10.950> into

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
paring knife and cutting directly into

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.010 
paring knife and cutting directly into
the<00:01:11.909> Apple<00:01:12.360> straight<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the Apple straight in like this and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820 
the Apple straight in like this and
cutting<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.530> carefully<00:01:18.259> around<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> edge

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
cutting very carefully around the edge

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.780 
cutting very carefully around the edge
and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.299> take<00:01:21.509> melon<00:01:22.350> baller<00:01:22.790> which

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and then you can take melon baller which

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
and then you can take melon baller which
has<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> sharp<00:01:24.330> edge<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.710> take<00:01:25.979> out

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
has a sharp edge you can just take out

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.999 
has a sharp edge you can just take out
that<00:01:26.610> core<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.270> Apple<00:01:27.590> see<00:01:28.590> how<00:01:28.710> simple

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that core of the Apple see how simple

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
that core of the Apple see how simple
this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> nice<00:01:30.390> clean<00:01:30.900> cut<00:01:31.259> edge

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
this is you get a nice clean cut edge

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760 
this is you get a nice clean cut edge
with<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> melon<00:01:32.340> baller<00:01:33.350> okay<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:34.619> it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
with this melon baller okay then it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
with this melon baller okay then it's
just<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> matter<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> sort<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> sizing<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
just a matter of sort of sizing the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.289 
just a matter of sort of sizing the
candle<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:38.310> better<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.270> too

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
candle it's better not to make it too

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
candle it's better not to make it too
large<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> beginning<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> can

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
large in the beginning because you can

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.370 
large in the beginning because you can
always<00:01:41.009> cut<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> can't<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.290> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
always cut it out but you can't put it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
always cut it out but you can't put it
back<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:44.479> alright<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.960> go<00:01:46.939> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
back in there alright so there we go you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
back in there alright so there we go you
can<00:01:48.000> see<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:49.710> with

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can see that it's just about right with

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
can see that it's just about right with
just<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.090> pressure<00:01:51.680> what<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.070> do

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
just a little pressure what I like to do

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
just a little pressure what I like to do
to<00:01:53.369> keep<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.850> edges<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> Apple<00:01:55.049> from

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to keep the edges of the Apple from

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
to keep the edges of the Apple from
shriveling<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:56.280> we've<00:01:56.790> cut<00:01:57.000> into<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
shriveling because we've cut into it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.350 
shriveling because we've cut into it
it's<00:01:58.110> likely<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> dehydrate<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.549> it<00:02:00.210> will

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
it's likely to dehydrate and it will

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.959 
it's likely to dehydrate and it will
discolor<00:02:00.869> as<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.500> apples<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.820> can

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
discolor as we know apples will you can

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.220 
discolor as we know apples will you can
