 so here is my terrace so that's it then 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.689
 last year here we had a blueberry 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.619

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 the poppy winter yeah there we have a 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.390
 poppy who pushed into the tray 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 so we put an orange tree instead 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.050
 there a few weeks ago 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.590
 here we have an apple tree the mulberry does not have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.100
 spent the winter here there are flowers of the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 father if we put a foot of eggplant there 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 here everything is fine there are plenty of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.700
 strawberries there is the woody bottom that goes 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 we make raspberries that started 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.780
 small flowers in the cherry 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.809
 he tears too much look at that we're going to have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.619
 full series 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 gilles too happy here we put a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.979
 rosebush and we have two vines a life here at 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.860
 of red grapes and a life here of 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.960
 white grapes and both are going well and 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 we have strawberries here 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 yeah we have pretty shoes from a drone 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.900
 friends and so that's so funny because 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 in the little insect house there are 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.170
 all the time little bees and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420
 small of the small insects that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 come to walk 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.570
 yeah there is an oaxaca flower bud 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 are ill it is then up we put 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.180
 three feet of tomatoes 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'm going if we want like that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.009
 footed there a foot there and a foot 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 that's why we put them in water because 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.460
 that and the slugs to us eat them 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.009
 then at each next to each foot of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.330
 tomatoes we put romaine lettuce and 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.040
 like the slug stop eating them 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.369
 you see there it's an author she 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.340
 not circulate and you want to film but ok 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.340
 then explain it here so we have to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.590
 the oregano there we bought 1 fold me back 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 but so this third one that we buy at 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.069
 time you do not have to put your finger on the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.620
 this is the third one we buy 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.660
 so to I think it's it supports 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 not the sun at your fingertips on on lecce 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.209
 triple a whose job is in this wholesale 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.569
 bins there was a sin na that died 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.920
 as well 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.480
 that's a lot of things they 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.480

 chlorophyll is really this way 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.600

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.310
