00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 all hayushki and microphone style today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.770
 I decided to do a little review on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.469
 thrillers to be born and with freddie 4 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.889
 and at the end I will say a few words about the song 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.010
 warehouse in which youtube lot and after 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.660
 This trailer has a lot of output 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 negative comments 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.789
 scott where are you doing pizzerias why not 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.920
 Well 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.860
 why actions happen 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.340
 home okay about it now i'm all 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.280
 usually what is five nights at 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 freddy's 4 is supposed to take place in 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.920
 some house 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.650
 but it seems to me that all that is in it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.670
 home we will not all time seems to me 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.489
 what will be bitten either guard 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.620
 or someone else and most likely it 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.290
 will not be the first night as we should 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.650
 first meet yourself 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 animatronics and then he remembered 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.670
 about them fell asleep at work and he dreamed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.210
 nightmares 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.340
 you trailer them very many phrases but i 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 decided to allocate two here we warm up to her son to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.180
 plank and are playing 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.659
 translates as you think what game well 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.280
 there is a game with you and it seems that all this 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.280
 sends us to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.229
 freddy krugeru remember the very first 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.520
 scott's teaser there the drive was freddie was 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.340
 similar to freddie kruger but long 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 apartment then sticking these here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.119
 little freddy key 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 so what seems to me what applies 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.070
 it's more to Freddie because he believed 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.829
 what is all game for him 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.679
 Well, here we are in the nursery 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:57.369
 room and under i will tell them later 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.310
 because one of our hits in Windows 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.090
 in my opinion said what it sends us 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.929
 the room background is Guy Claus and the doors are new in 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.190
 also one of the phrases in the game five nights at 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.870
 freddy's 4 that is, there we will have doors 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:22.150
 and but we have to close but the doors will 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.520
 no way they need fnafe just 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.610
 close it is the usual 2 electric and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.040
 By the way, what I wanted to mention is that in 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.760
 the last two parts there is no electricity 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.340
 as if 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.280
 This is one of the main mistakes because 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.959
 remember how in the first part we were burning 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.819
 when 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.359
 Blackouts here these here 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.599
 Doors as I show you what you can 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.180
 will look out and look if the dance 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.870
 any animatronics or else 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.540
 anybody 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 well, it will probably be the main function 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.299
 the gameplay in mince on this is your 14 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.700
 I say and youtuber what there is no Komi we 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.419
 we will go and remember teasers 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.129
 someone for a small deserto what type 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:16.470
 shitty things come small 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:21.540
 portions and it seems to me that rather 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.780
 that's it here's a little toy plus 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:29.609
 the traffic will deliver us the most 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.439
 fear of hate than these animatronics well 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.209
 that animatronics you just saw them 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.209
 like this 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.849
 foxy and you can just shut it all down 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.109
 And for him you need to follow Odessa time 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:48.510
 check and there is like t'aime 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:50.190
 that is, you can be late and all on 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.400
 you will run into him no longer 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.400
 stop there is a foxy 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:03.060
 now he is real they are these 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.609
 little freddy whale's there now 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.659
 you can come back and there will be a bed here 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:12.479
 these little futons and it seems to me 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:17.250
 what well or cover or somewhere nearby 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:19.409
 big freaky himself because not sure 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.620
 can't live long without him 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:27.750
 here but the scales are a crooner bonny what is five 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.470
 Nights at Freddy's 4 I think it will be 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.440
 interesting game and I wanted to say 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.820
 about the letter, remember that in the cat 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.230
 sent by email 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.990
 many flags of us a message but especially 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.200
 foreign what type 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.610
 trailer will be released on the weekend game 8 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.160
 August it seems to me that the game is not 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.510
 will be released on August 8, it will be released in greenlight 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.970
 steam greenlight and then squat 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.540
 will finish it 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.590
 and soon we can play it well 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.590
 Well thanks guys
