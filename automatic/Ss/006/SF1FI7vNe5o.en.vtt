he's<00:01:48.659> just<00:01:49.100> spawning<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.700> he<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
he's just spawning there or he just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.660 
he's just spawning there or he just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
knows that route so the other routes

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
knows that route so the other routes
maybe<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.270> might<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:54.869> bit<00:01:55.050> better

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
maybe to be might be a little bit better

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.999 
maybe to be might be a little bit better
going<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.190> little<00:01:56.580> hills<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.149> valleys

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
going up the little hills and valleys

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.550 
going up the little hills and valleys
but<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.160> little<00:01:59.250> closer<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.700> be<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> get

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
but it's a little closer to be so I get

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.940 
but it's a little closer to be so I get
