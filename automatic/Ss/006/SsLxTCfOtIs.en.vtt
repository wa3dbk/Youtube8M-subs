00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.620
 Hello, my name is GermÃ¡n Cortez 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.300
 and I have the pleasure of belonging to the group 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.270
 of instructors of the association 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.490
 Latin American security at in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.439
 this time I want to tell you about the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.410
 content of our circuit course 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.960
 closed TV level 2 or level 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.540
 advanced this of course is a 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.650
 continuation of our basic course the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 level 1 in this course we begin 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.480
 precisely continuing with the cameras 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.059
 advanced the subject that is today's 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.470
 fashion that are ip cameras but inside 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.290
 of them 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.089
 the theme of megapixel cameras 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.850
 we just look at the definitions of 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.040
 the different types of resolution that 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.920
 we can find for of course 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.710
 make digital zoom and be able to take 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.239
 precise and exact details which is what 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.790
 Many times our customers 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.880
 want we know then a little the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.729
 difference between dynamic resolution 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.250
 and the static resolution and we look 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.330
 effectively a network camera or a 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.130
 ip camera which is what really has 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.370
 on the outside how can we do the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.830
 adjustments as we can suddenly review 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.690
 the elements that make that camera 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.230
 transmit video through a network of 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.150
 data properly and then by 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.210
 course we have to focus inside 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.670
 of the topic of data networks that's a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.790
 topic that we effectively touch from a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.850
 detailed way to know how a 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.290
 TV signal can travel 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.630
 properly without losing speed without 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.410
 lose resolution within a network of 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 modern and current data we also look 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.510
 the subject of digital recording as they should 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.810
 be digital video recorders can 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.210
 be stand- alone type or they can be 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.070
 type based on a pc or on a server 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.080
 we look at how the cards are 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.849
 video capturers we look at the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.930
 basic characteristics of those 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.220
 digital recorders and we look at some 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.420
 examples of how it can be 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.190
 the images that can give us a duty 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.270
 adequately but beyond this 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:32.070
 we look at almost 32 35 specific functions 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.860
 of a duty or an nbl that must have that 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.160
 Duty not to be a toy but be a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.320
 really professional element and part 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 of all that professionalism is to look at the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.040
 compression algorithms then 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.050
 we begin to understand how is a 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.090
 compression algorithm how is a 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.770
 algorithm that has signal losses 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.870
 of video and how is an algorithm that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.640
 he soon gives us a video signal 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.320
 very intact we learn the different 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.690
 concepts and algorithms that the market 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.450
 is offering us today and finally 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.700
 we come to a key question that is and 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.980
 how much hard drive do I need inside of me 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.260
 duty and for this obviously we have to 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.690
 look at the formulas the theoretical formula 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.880
 very simple but how to do it 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.740
 many times sometimes we go through a 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.350
 excel sheet to look like 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.900
 we find out that value of 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.300
 hard drive that we need and know that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.730
 the answer does not give in gigabytes almost 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.070
 it always gives whole bits or even more 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.170
 there therefore we have to look at how 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.760
 we make a large hard disk almost 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.160
 we always look at what an arrangement of 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.990
 hard drive in network configuration and how 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.180
 all this is mixed with others 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.950
 equipment that is traditionally seen in 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.650
 CCTV as a circuit 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.360
 video matrix that can be virtual or 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.130
 it can be an analog video matrix 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.990
 depends on how your system is 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.020
 we learn then what it is for us 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.600
 a cctv system converted into 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.020
 recording and concentration of all 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.780
 signals on a single computer in a matrix 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.700
 finally we touch the media theme 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.860
 of transmission that had been left to us 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.960
 pending of our course 1 in this 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.630
 case we touch the fiber optic theme 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.850
 we try to demystify it a bit and 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.190
 we look at the wireless part that although 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.980
 many people are using it to 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.770
 sometimes it is not the safest element for 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.020
 transmit video we finished then 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.310
 with some key concepts like 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.860
 structured cabling 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 or how are we going to do in our 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.090
 control room so everything works 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.680
 very well and finally we get a 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.450
 little in that data networks topic that 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.190
 I told them we talked a little about 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.650
 model or if we talk a little bit about 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.480
 basic concepts we look at what are the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 different types of ip addresses 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.639
 static static ip addresses 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560
 fixed publics we look at how it is that 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.470
 transmits all this through a network 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.780
 and all these concepts like normally 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.870
 they give security to our system of 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.270
 security to finish we arrive at the 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.190
 virtual matrix concepts that is what 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.440
 that today is suddenly in the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.860
 maximum point of technology however 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.510
 you have to know that if it is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.790
 what our client needs or not 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.100
 our last subject of the advanced course 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.710
 is precisely the video analysis and 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.170
 it's all the software is doing 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.360
 to prevent the human being from 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.270
 permanently looking at the images and 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.980
 recognizing abnormal situations all 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.810
 this stage of video analytics we 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.510
 convert the video we know 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.000
 traditionally in simply data 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.910
 so in this way we come to a 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.190
 complete solution but they know that still 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.950
 we have a lot to learn as per 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.110
 example the new revolution that maybe 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.140
 is going to be our next cctv course 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.050
 which is the whole part of cctv high 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.110
 definition but not only the hdtv that 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.560
 we know traditionally but the world 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.740
 dsd and what is new coming 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.300
 to our security guild I invite you 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.210
 so that they accompany us in our 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.740
 advanced level cctv course I speak 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.310
 german cortez thank you very much 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.310
