 is this and when you turn on the phone 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.570
 there is how you can see it is very good 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.660
 and well, if they do not buy it or if 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.880
 have the telcel or another carrier and 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.270

 samsung broadcast will be left in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.590
 description of the video and with the route in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 where they should paste the files ok 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.280
 Well then let's change what 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.560
 animation and if you did not like etc. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.479
 etcetera in the auto system application 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 that allows you to change the style of the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 letter and well let's go to point x 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 animations we select one and we see the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.090
 prohibit how it will be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.090
 okay 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.090
 there we are seeing different and then 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.870
 good the truth is that they are enough 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.800
 quite 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.870
 As you can see they are many and well 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.510
 I want to apply one in this case to me 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.990
 I really liked this doing to sing to see 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.990
 It is very good and we give it in download 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.310
 is already downloaded and will be marked as well 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.810
 in green ok 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.380
 once this is done 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.000
 sorry for leaving me the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.770
 looking for animation 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.650
 and we give it in a state 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.440
 to this and we wait for who goes out and everything 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.630
 that says when you restart the phone if you do not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.270
 they see that they change the animation bitch 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.310
 good is because it is not compatible with the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.459
 with the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.099
 resolution of your device or size 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.020
 of the screen brings many factors and 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.489
 well you have to see different how can 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.489
 see in mine 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.020
 well maybe it did not settle or something 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.900
 A) Yes 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.120
 ok installed us then you have to try 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.950
 with others but good if it is very functional 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.700
 the truth has worked for me 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.530
 many times and well then that's how 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.260
 you can change the boot animation 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.400
 from your phone very easily without 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 need to extract from roms of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.570
