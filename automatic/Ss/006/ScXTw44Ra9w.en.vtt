00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and it's the marketing and welcome to one more 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.460
 video of her this time I have one 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 sad story to tell you more 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.130
 It's a real story . 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 a story that happened in my life 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.379
 which is the following the same player was 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.470
 tire problem so every time 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.900
 I recorded the video suddenly crashed 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 screen for a while and I missed this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 This video was already crap. 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.119
 recording right 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.000
 So I said, I already had to format the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 pc, do not kill, never thought 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 be all right 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.969
 propose in which format the pc galera is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 boring because inside your dear pc 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.300
 There are a million things you do not even know. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 Remember that in the future you will need 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.489
 What you will need if you go 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.530
 killing you is not lost but not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.059
 there was no way to format it then 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 I took my pen drive from my external HDD and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 put everything I thought I would 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.230
 stepping on the external hd to format is a 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.120
 computer I remembered that I was not 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.059
 one very important thing in this hd 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.339
 external that was the center of the sims 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.770
 so I've lost my whole 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.920
 fate that made me very upset 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 but this is only the beginning of the tiny beginning 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.979
 of the horror story that is about to 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.990
 tell you the good format you noticed 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 that you need a certain Hindle and I 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.880
 I do not have windows 7 because I do not 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.159

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.360
 I do not like windows 8 and I do not want 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.930
 on two others on windows 8 on my 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.119
 because they only say bad things about him but 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.820
 at the end there is a bookstore to buy 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.829

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.720

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.530
 it comes with the game of the game 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.140

 Cute desktop and see the start menu

 not to change anything in my life in 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.859
 Nothing in my life has not changed at all. 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.680
 You know I changed, I was afraid, that's it. 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.440
 that changed too fine too're not 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.269
 It's okay, okay, I got it. Let's test. 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.590
 the internet from my computer open one 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.569
 news site 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.850
 right to open a news site that can read 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.680
 news the first news that is is the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:16.410
 microsoft landu launches windows 10 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.380
 You're kidding with me, right? 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.359
 Godspeed, you and I just bought 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 this could of us who does not know of 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.340
 nothing because 700 samples and you told me 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.010
 which will launch Windows 10 next year 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.020
 You could have given the news someday. 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.510
 before they go to buy this crap but 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.880
 not microsoft apple gave life 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.729
 apparently neoton in red bull time 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.440
 who raised the tone is energetic but 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.090
 then the details of those windows that 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.070
 I wanted to communicate with you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.669
 first of all windows is the windows 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.770
 10 because 8's windows jump to the 10th 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.510
 windows 8 was so stupid that they 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.070
 they wanted to distance the number to see if 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.930
 The people do not remember right. 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.040
 and now you know what they're going to do in 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.870
 windows 10 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.320
 they will turn everything into windows 7 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.600
 back not all iran guys are serious 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.430
 one of the main characteristics that 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.280
 were talking about windows 10 is the 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.150
 next we will come back with besc top 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.520
 old 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.280
 the search bar will come back let's go 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.840
 change will not have to diminish arde 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.970
 club where you guys are going to you 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.460
 will have but will also have a minute the 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.080
 windows 7 or they will sell you by 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.419
 of what I believe will be more expensive not 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.139
 It's going to be another 700 reais, you're only 800 thousand. 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.330
 real 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.199
 amy winehouse sell the deal was the same 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.910
 at 27 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.070
 the only difference being a little power 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:39.780
 either because the windows 8 not 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.669
 either it irritated me the level that it is 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.470
 Countless imaginable if you can not 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.289
 said you put inside a whale 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.160
 blue does not fit as much irritation as 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.110
 I have now 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.510
 without mentioning that now I had to install 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.930
 all new programs aside 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.490
 positive for the positive side is that 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.000
 problem was not with the computer 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:04.960
 There are more games we're not catching. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.150
 but but but I went to record the games on 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.970
 Mineirao because no windows 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:14.620
 recognizing my normal ball hd in 2h 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.479
 head is not recognized right 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.030
 normal so every time I record a 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.250
 video inside of you normal hd when I 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.229
 to open the video it would have 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.419
 synchronized with the camera 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.000

 I even discovered that I put you to the 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.630
 java software in my ssd because there 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.600
