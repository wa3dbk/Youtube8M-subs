00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.000 

it's<00:03:18.739> usually<00:03:19.730> used<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:20.060> little<00:03:20.300> scoop<00:03:21.010> I'm

just going to kind of pour it in there
that<00:03:23.870> made<00:03:24.319> this<00:03:24.530> recipe<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.400> much<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:26.030> can

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
that made this recipe so much I can

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.850 
that made this recipe so much I can
practically<00:03:27.110> do<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:27.800> my<00:03:27.980> seat

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
practically do it in my seat

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.030 
practically do it in my seat
right<00:03:31.450> turn<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:34.930> ok<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.319> is<00:03:36.470> look<00:03:36.500> terribly

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040

right turn up ok this is look terribly
appetizing<00:03:37.760> right<00:03:37.910> now<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.120> doesn't<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.739> I

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
appetizing right now it doesn't but I

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.800 
appetizing right now it doesn't but I
promise<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.190> perform<00:03:41.060> into<00:03:41.330> something<00:03:41.690> good

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
promise you perform into something good

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.420 
promise you perform into something good
it<00:03:42.050> may<00:03:42.230> take<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.500> little<00:03:42.590> practice<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.310> you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
it may take a little practice for you

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.339 
it may take a little practice for you
but<00:03:43.610> watch<00:03:43.760> my<00:03:43.970> video<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.780> just<00:03:44.930> follow<00:03:45.170> the

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
but watch my video and just follow the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.960 
but watch my video and just follow the
steps<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.890> they<00:03:46.040> ship<00:03:46.310> them<00:03:46.489> out<00:03:46.640> delicious

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
steps and they ship them out delicious

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.600 
steps and they ship them out delicious
now<00:03:47.930> after<00:03:48.290> we<00:03:48.379> mixed<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.769> all<00:03:48.890> up<00:03:48.950> we<00:03:49.220> do<00:03:49.370> want

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
now after we mixed it all up we do want

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.130 
now after we mixed it all up we do want
to<00:03:49.640> let<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.910> sit<00:03:50.090> for<00:03:50.120> about<00:03:50.360> five<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.750> ten

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
to let it sit for about five to ten

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.800 
to let it sit for about five to ten
minutes<00:03:51.170> before<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.890> look<00:03:55.269> so<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:56.569> been

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
minutes before you look so it's been

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.330 
minutes before you look so it's been
about<00:03:56.840> five<00:03:57.200> minutes<00:03:57.500> now<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:57.890> as<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.160> can

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
about five minutes now and as you can

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.059 
about five minutes now and as you can
see<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.610> mixture<00:03:59.120> has<00:03:59.269> thickened

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
see the mixture has thickened

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.839 
see the mixture has thickened
drastically<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:03.130> could<00:04:04.130> see<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.790> it

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
drastically if you could see that it

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.559 
drastically if you could see that it
will<00:04:05.060> be<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.420> little<00:04:05.959> thicker<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:08.209> let's<00:04:08.420> go

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
will be a little thicker so let's go

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.890 
will be a little thicker so let's go
ahead<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:09.110> run<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.829> for<00:04:10.130> about<00:04:10.280> half<00:04:10.670> come<00:04:11.060> to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
ahead and run it for about half come to

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.659 
ahead and run it for about half come to
the<00:04:12.019> griddle<00:04:12.910> which<00:04:13.910> i<00:04:14.560> preheated<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:15.890> I

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
the griddle which i preheated and I

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:26.050 
the griddle which i preheated and I
sprayed<00:04:17.239> with<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:24.700> it's<00:04:25.700> not<00:04:25.880> like<00:04:26.030> a

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
sprayed with this it's not like a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.939 
sprayed with this it's not like a
regular<00:04:26.240> pancake<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.440> you're<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:27.889> really

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
regular pancake so you're not really

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.520 
regular pancake so you're not really
going<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.400> see<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.580> bubbling<00:04:29.150> right<00:04:29.479> away<00:04:29.780> just

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
going to see it bubbling right away just

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.550 
going to see it bubbling right away just
kind<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.919> gotta<00:04:31.100> follow<00:04:31.400> your<00:04:31.550> intuition

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
kind of gotta follow your intuition

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.460 
kind of gotta follow your intuition
you<00:04:33.740> wanted<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.100> stay<00:04:34.400> nice<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.639> moist<00:04:35.060> and

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
you wanted to stay nice and moist and

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.540 
you wanted to stay nice and moist and
because<00:04:36.470> they<00:04:36.590> are<00:04:36.740> cleaner<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.490> they<00:04:37.820> are

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
because they are cleaner and they are

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.210 
because they are cleaner and they are
essentially<00:04:39.120> fat-free<00:04:39.750> they<00:04:40.560> will<00:04:40.920> dry<00:04:41.190> out

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
essentially fat-free they will dry out

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.730 
essentially fat-free they will dry out
very<00:04:41.520> easily<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.540> just<00:04:43.080> keep<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.350> close<00:04:43.380> eye<00:04:43.710> on

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
very easily so just keep a close eye on

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.120 
very easily so just keep a close eye on
don't<00:04:44.250> walk<00:04:44.370> away<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.660> they<00:04:49.050> took<00:04:49.500> about<00:04:49.740> five

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
don't walk away so they took about five

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.890 
don't walk away so they took about five
to<00:04:50.430> eight<00:04:50.460> minutes<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:51.120> cook<00:04:51.300> when<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.540> sign

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
to eight minutes to cook when you sign

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.450 
to eight minutes to cook when you sign
as<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.200> say<00:04:52.350> they're<00:04:52.500> lightly<00:04:52.770> golden<00:04:53.130> brown

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
as you say they're lightly golden brown

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.840 
as you say they're lightly golden brown
now<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:54.420> thicker<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.380> mixture<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.830> a<00:04:56.250> little

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
now the thicker the mixture is a little

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.550 
now the thicker the mixture is a little
longer<00:04:57.060> that<00:04:57.420> it'll<00:04:57.630> take<00:04:57.900> if<00:04:58.230> you<00:04:58.320> cook<00:04:58.530> it

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
longer that it'll take if you cook it

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.740 
longer that it'll take if you cook it
right<00:04:59.160> away<00:04:59.310> you<00:04:59.490> don't<00:04:59.760> let<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.000> sit<00:05:00.390> you'll

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
right away you don't let it sit you'll

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.060 
right away you don't let it sit you'll
probably<00:05:01.020> be<00:05:01.230> able<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.410> flip<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.770> right<00:05:01.890> away

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
probably be able to flip it right away

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.550 
probably be able to flip it right away
