00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.840
 halo has got together today i have the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.590
 tuk mz before this place changed yours 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.900
 interface in minecraft we mighty 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 everything looks different here 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 and the monsters and the animals over there 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.180
 A moment have beams over their heads 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.130
 these are the life indicator 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.710
 the creature then how it changes 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 if you could hit the serious one 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.809
 specifically see if the monster is dead 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 then if you see a blog sighted 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.860
 you on the top right 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 what a blog this is and id becomes 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 then synonymous with displayed but very 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 good if you have a mod in it or off 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.739
 generally decided then want down 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.250
 left is an ad for the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.979
 the server which shows to who everything online 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.600
 is above the left then the compass 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.060
 we left so moved with her 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 you have nothing to compass forces above 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.340
 right you have the day display the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 the sun is just steak or the moon and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 stop in what a video man is like 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 late just in reality it is in 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.640
 which direction you look and how much 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 place still in the inventory as well as in her 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.009
 see how that changes now yes 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.009
 and down here 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 the action bar looks different yes 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.350
 if you like this mod too 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.180
 install then stay tuned for 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.540
 we need the installation once 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.399
 the minecraft continues and the tmc does 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 You will find both in the description 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.960
 First we install the minecraft 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.509
 forge in the pulpit client and then on 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 ok and nobody can handle it 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.810
 he is the researcher then installs 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.320
 we press the windows button and he 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 give 1 percent from tata percent 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.570
 ducks minecraft folder is located there 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.069

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.560
 arrived in the main menu 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.620
 There we just pull the tuk 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.480
 withdraws pure and she is finished with 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.520
 you can also install one 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.830
 Create folders after you forge 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.050
 have installed and the mods inside 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 fourteen times stronger then start 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.470
 So we choose our minecraft 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.690
