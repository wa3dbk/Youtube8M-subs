you want to find where the car go Bob

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.540 
you want to find where the car go Bob
and<00:00:47.910> Titan<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.680> first<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.010> I'll<00:00:50.280> show<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
and Titan is first of all I'll show you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
and Titan is first of all I'll show you
where<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> car<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.210> Bob<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> best

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
where the car go Bob is this is the best

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
where the car go Bob is this is the best
place<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.210> dock<00:00:54.539> down

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
place for it it's a little dock down

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.170 
place for it it's a little dock down
here<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.100> guess<00:00:56.370> pause<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.760> video<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
here and so I guess pause the video and

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.939 
here and so I guess pause the video and
look<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.020> map<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.469> doesn't

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
look for that on your map it doesn't

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.979 
look for that on your map it doesn't
always<00:00:59.100> spawn<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.300> doesn't<00:01:00.329> spawn<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
always spawn in if it doesn't spawn in

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349 
always spawn in if it doesn't spawn in
and<00:01:01.170> fly<00:01:01.980> away<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.309> drive<00:01:02.699> away<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.180> drive

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and fly away or drive away and drive

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.830 
and fly away or drive away and drive
back<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.260> eventually<00:01:04.470> spawn<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.189> so

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
back and it will eventually spawn it so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
back and it will eventually spawn it so
it<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.020> used<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.040> spawn<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.820> there

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it actually used to not spawn in there

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
it actually used to not spawn in there
after<00:01:09.240> certain<00:01:09.450> level<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.869> they've<00:01:09.990> changed

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
after certain level but they've changed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.039 
after certain level but they've changed
that<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
that so that's pretty good to know and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.340 
that so that's pretty good to know and
the<00:01:13.049> Titan<00:01:13.530> sorry<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.720> airport<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the Titan sorry is in the airport and I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
the Titan sorry is in the airport and I
believe<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.549> hangars<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
believe it's one of the back hangars I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.609 
believe it's one of the back hangars I
think<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> these<00:01:18.990> ones<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
think it's one of these ones but if you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.960 
think it's one of these ones but if you
go<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.009> back<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> airport<00:01:20.700> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
go to the back of the airport is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
go to the back of the airport is
definitely<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> hangars<00:01:22.409> I'll

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

do<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.619> too<00:01:40.890> many<00:01:40.979> times<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> cargobob

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
do it too many times in the cargobob

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.749 
do it too many times in the cargobob
because<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.960> destroy<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.520> thing

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
because it will just destroy the thing

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.630 
because it will just destroy the thing
so<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.899> good<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:47.189> lucky

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
so you have to be good and get not lucky

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
so you have to be good and get not lucky
I<00:01:47.820> found<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> best<00:01:48.720> method<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> try<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
I found the best method is to try and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
I found the best method is to try and
get<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.430> vertical<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.030> possible<00:01:51.090> which<00:01:51.600> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
get as vertical as possible which is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.130 
get as vertical as possible which is
kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.530> difficult<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> definitely

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
kind of difficult to do but definitely

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
kind of difficult to do but definitely
is<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> knack<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.740> but<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.219> that's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
is a knack to it but there you go that's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.249 
is a knack to it but there you go that's
how<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> show<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> can

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
how you get it and just to show you can

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.749 
how you get it and just to show you can
go<00:01:58.380> inside<00:01:58.740> oh<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.880> close<00:02:01.520> let's<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
go inside oh that was close let's just

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.459 
go inside oh that was close let's just
show<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.570> inside<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> checking<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
show you me going inside and checking it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
show you me going inside and checking it
out<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> yeah<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.229> me<00:02:07.469> inside<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.700> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
out so yeah this is me inside when you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
out so yeah this is me inside when you
stand<00:02:09.119> inside<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.690> didn't<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
stand inside if you didn't know it's in

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.720 
stand inside if you didn't know it's in
the<00:02:10.379> video<00:02:10.590> it's<00:02:10.830> actually<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.400> really

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the video it's actually really really

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
the video it's actually really really
stable<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.870> Tison<00:02:13.290> until

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
stable not like the Tison until

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.560 
stable not like the Tison until
so<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.490> could<00:02:14.610> probably<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.150> five<00:02:15.390> or

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
so you could probably get like five or

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.970 
so you could probably get like five or
six<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.560> chilling<00:02:16.860> out

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
to do from here is just pull away and it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.380 
to do from here is just pull away and it
will<00:03:13.739> open<00:03:13.830> gradually<00:03:14.489> now<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.300> little

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
will open gradually now it's a little

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.900 
will open gradually now it's a little
bit<00:03:15.600> sketchy<00:03:16.020> because<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.130> do<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.520> with

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
bit sketchy because if you do it with

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.360 
bit sketchy because if you do it with
somebody<00:03:18.150> else<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:19.590> going<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.860> appear<00:03:20.160> open

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
somebody else it's going to appear open

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.040 
somebody else it's going to appear open
on<00:03:20.700> your<00:03:20.850> screen<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.390> closed<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.840> their

on your screen and closed on their

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.170 
on your screen and closed on their
screen<00:03:22.380> or<00:03:22.709> vice<00:03:23.100> versa<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:24.090> bit

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
screen or vice versa it's a little bit

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.460 
screen or vice versa it's a little bit
glitchy<00:03:24.420> when<00:03:24.690> George<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.110> were<00:03:25.290> making

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
glitchy when George and I were making

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.610 
glitchy when George and I were making
the<00:03:25.739> funny<00:03:25.920> moments<00:03:26.340> montage<00:03:27.230> with<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the funny moments montage with the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.050 
the funny moments montage with the
Titans<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.640> really<00:03:29.970> really

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
Titans it was actually really really

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.870 
Titans it was actually really really
difficult<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:31.140> didn't<00:03:31.410> always<00:03:31.880> equal

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
difficult because it didn't always equal

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.880 
difficult because it didn't always equal
what<00:03:33.540> was<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.870> my<00:03:33.989> screen<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.440> us<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.739> his

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
what was on my screen to us on his

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.290 
what was on my screen to us on his
screen<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.250> he<00:03:35.430> didn't<00:03:35.730> know<00:03:35.790> what<00:03:35.970> was<00:03:36.000> going

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
screen so he didn't know what was going

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.720 
screen so he didn't know what was going
on<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.450> didn't<00:03:36.780> know<00:03:36.870> what<00:03:36.989> was<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.350> and

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
on I didn't know what was going on and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.050 
on I didn't know what was going on and
let<00:03:38.730> me<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:38.970> take<00:03:39.150> off<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:40.140> gander<00:03:41.060> see

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
let me just take off a little gander see

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.460 
let me just take off a little gander see
it<00:03:42.150> does<00:03:42.300> closed<00:03:42.540> back<00:03:42.780> up<00:03:42.930> again<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.319> you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
it does closed back up again and you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.140 
it does closed back up again and you
can't<00:03:43.739> open<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.160> once<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.430> goes<00:03:44.519> back<00:03:44.790> up<00:03:44.910> again

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
can't open it once it goes back up again

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.710 
can't open it once it goes back up again
so<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.080> only<00:03:46.200> way<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.739> back<00:03:46.890> open<00:03:47.280> is

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
so the only way to get it back open is

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.920 
so the only way to get it back open is
to<00:03:49.550> land<00:03:50.550> again<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> same<00:03:51.360> thing<00:03:51.630> the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
to land again and do the same thing the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.039 
to land again and do the same thing the
only<00:03:52.110> problem<00:03:52.440> with<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:53.630> yeah<00:03:54.660> the
