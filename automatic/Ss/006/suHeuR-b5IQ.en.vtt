00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
out here alive out here by the campfire

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
out here alive out here by the campfire
we<00:00:06.240> had<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:08.870> saturated<00:00:10.070> piece<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.280> pine<00:00:11.550> yeah

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
we had a saturated piece of pine yeah

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.340 
we had a saturated piece of pine yeah
that<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.719> pine<00:00:12.960> tree<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:15.170> just<00:00:16.170> as

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
that was a little pine tree and just as

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.830 
that was a little pine tree and just as
an<00:00:16.500> experiment<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.460> lit<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.270> top<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
an experiment we lit it the top of it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.960 
an experiment we lit it the top of it
and<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.289> kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.100> acting<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> torch

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and it's kind of acting like a torch

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.300 
and it's kind of acting like a torch
here<00:00:21.180> yeah<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.689> fat<00:00:21.960> would<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
here yeah that fat would just like a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.359 
here yeah that fat would just like a
candle<00:00:23.850> yeah<00:00:24.560> will<00:00:25.560> probably<00:00:25.800> burn<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
candle yeah will probably burn for a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.400 
candle yeah will probably burn for a
while<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.119> density<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
while the density of that just that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.960 
while the density of that just that
small<00:00:28.680> piece<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> woods<00:00:29.310> probably<00:00:29.670> three

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
small piece of woods probably three

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.179 
small piece of woods probably three
times<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.140> know<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> dry<00:00:31.619> piece<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
times with a you know a dry piece of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
times with a you know a dry piece of
pine<00:00:32.399> wood<00:00:32.669> way<00:00:32.880> yeah<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.899> pretty<00:00:34.079> cool<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
pine wood way yeah it's pretty cool it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.620 
pine wood way yeah it's pretty cool it
feels<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> rock<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.120> pick<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> off

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
feels like a rock would you pick it off

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.110 
feels like a rock would you pick it off
right<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:37.829> way<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.370> heavy<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.910> heavy

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
right but yeah way it's heavy it's heavy

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
right but yeah way it's heavy it's heavy
that's<00:00:39.660> definitely<00:00:40.649> forth<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.309> somehow<00:00:41.579> we

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
that's definitely forth but somehow we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
that's definitely forth but somehow we
were<00:00:41.969> looking<00:00:42.239> looking<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> piece<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
were looking looking at that piece of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.869 
were looking looking at that piece of
thinking<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.040> wonder<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:44.700> make<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
thinking I wonder if this would make a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
thinking I wonder if this would make a
torch<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.660> or<00:00:45.870> yeah<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.890> little

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
torch you know or yeah just a little

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.270 
torch you know or yeah just a little
bundle<00:00:47.340> yep<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> flat<00:00:49.680> base<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
bundle yep so with the the flat base to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
bundle yep so with the the flat base to
just<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> sitting<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.329> rock<00:00:51.390> here

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
just have it sitting on this rock here

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.770 
just have it sitting on this rock here
next<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> fork<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:55.160> yeah<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.460> honest<00:00:56.820> what

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
next to a fork and yeah be honest what

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720 
next to a fork and yeah be honest what
do<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.899> got<00:00:58.050> going<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:58.739> looks<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
do you got going on now looks like the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
do you got going on now looks like the
resin<00:01:00.239> from<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> heat<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.800> starting<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> run

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
resin from the heat is starting to run

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
resin from the heat is starting to run
out<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> wood<00:01:03.199> yeah<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.409> pretty<00:01:04.650> cool

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
out of the wood yeah it's pretty cool

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
out of the wood yeah it's pretty cool
looking<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:07.970> think<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> decided<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
looking I think we decided like that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
looking I think we decided like that
that's<00:01:10.140> maybe<00:01:10.439> we're<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.979> products<00:01:11.460> like

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that's maybe we're some products like

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.270 
that's maybe we're some products like
turpentine<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.299> such<00:01:12.720> come<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.380> hey<00:01:13.890> enter

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
turpentine and such come from hey enter

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.320 
turpentine and such come from hey enter

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
a little too much in there looks like

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.090 
a little too much in there looks like
it's<00:02:32.900> running<00:02:33.080> over<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.500> edge<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> little<00:02:33.830> bit

know no one of that is the rat or the
nut<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> nut<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.220> burning<00:02:40.820> yeah<00:02:41.750> well

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
nut I think the nut is burning yeah well

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.500 
nut I think the nut is burning yeah well
you<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.320> gonna<00:02:42.770> put<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> holder<00:02:44.480> of

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
you just gonna put that in a holder of

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.600 
you just gonna put that in a holder of
some<00:02:44.810> kind<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.350> still<00:02:45.620> burned<00:02:45.890> for<00:02:46.130> quite<00:02:46.580> a

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
some kind it's still burned for quite a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.150 
some kind it's still burned for quite a
while<00:02:46.810> yeah<00:02:48.760> yeah<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.970> nuts<00:02:50.180> burn<00:02:51.070> but<00:02:52.070> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
while yeah yeah the nuts burn but it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.500 
while yeah yeah the nuts burn but it
should<00:02:52.340> act<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.760> little<00:02:52.940> bit<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.330> wick

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
should act like a little bit of a wick

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.229 
should act like a little bit of a wick
to<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:53.989> I'm<00:02:54.140> thinking<00:02:54.380> right<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.040> think<00:02:55.970> so

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
to now I'm thinking right I think so

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.180 
to now I'm thinking right I think so
we'll<00:02:56.660> see<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:56.900> guess<00:02:57.080> yeah<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.500> will<00:02:57.770> step<00:02:58.160> back

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
we'll see I guess yeah I will step back

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.729 
we'll see I guess yeah I will step back
here<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.790> little<00:02:58.970> bit<00:02:59.209> watch<00:02:59.900> what<00:03:00.170> happens<00:03:00.620> and

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
here a little bit watch what happens and

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.710 
here a little bit watch what happens and
then<00:03:00.890> try<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:01.910> an<00:03:02.030> idea<00:03:02.360> how<00:03:02.510> long<00:03:02.660> that

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
then try and get an idea how long that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.830 
then try and get an idea how long that
burns<00:03:03.140> alright<00:03:03.830> sounds<00:03:04.820> good<00:03:05.030> not<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> clean
