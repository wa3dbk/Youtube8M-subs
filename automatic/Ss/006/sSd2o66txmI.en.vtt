00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.179
 flew metal box with 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.300
 ceramic cladding is 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.729
 a classic solution when 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.539
 performing dental crowns 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.419
 with her metal words 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.059
 veneer special 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 denture ceramics 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.059
 in order to crown 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 match the highest 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.579
 patient aesthetic requirements 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.489
 future color choices should be held 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.259
 very carefully 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.039
 for example with the help of special light 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.439
 scales 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.749
 or even using 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.539
 special high-tech 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.699
 color measuring instruments 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.360
 because the more accurate color description 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.790
 get a dental technician 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060
 will look better in the patient's mouth 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.060
 his work 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.890
 with a more detailed selection of colors 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.230
 determined and inconspicuous at first 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.860
 sight 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.660
 but very important customized 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 features of natural teeth 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.710
 in this case, they can then be 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 repeat some kind of artificial zombies 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.030
 crowns like this doesn't look like 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.840
 the result of prosthetics a 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.170
 perceived as natural sound 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 ceramic coating 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.450
 cladding is usually limited 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.350
 visible side of the tooth as well as the cutting edge 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.600
 front teeth 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 but the lining can cover and large 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
 surface area of ​​the crown coming into 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.750
 desirable or even facing inward 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.860
 oral cavity tooth surface 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.850
 The box can be covered with ceramic 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.410
 facing even completely 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.670
 but such work is longer and therefore 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.410
 it cannot be called standards 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.110
 by decision 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.100
 although aesthetically the result such as 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 she speaks for herself 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.900
 the frame of the crown is performed as follows. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.270
 so that on the neck of the tooth 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.340
 remained starts not covered facing 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.070
 metal bezel 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.020
 usually it does not degrade the aesthetics 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.659
 work as wart this bezel should 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.410
 leave also court 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.210
 if the gum is very thin 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.020
 may experience her to shine through the dark 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 the shadows 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.700
 or over time the gum edge may 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.009
 dip so that the metal bezel 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.600
 strip it can worsen the overall 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.740
 appearance of work 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830
 a dental technician can perform 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.989
 metal frame and differently 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 without metal rim 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.769
 instead it will be put special 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.509
 kiln ceramic masks 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.059
 but crowned with keyed crown 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.459
 ceramic mass 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.669
 this is actually an exclusive work 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.879
 the most successful can be called 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.049
 technology to perform crowns on 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.699
 galvanic based 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.049
 while the metal frame 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.349
 submitted only finish conditions 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.829
 electroplating gold 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.699
 advantages of this method 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.029
 highest crown fit accuracy 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.389
 sovereign which cannot be achieved 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.719
 by other methods and absolutely without 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 material compatibility 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.019
 thanks to a warm golden hue 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.889
 metal base cladding 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.889
 crowns look even more natural 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.609
 and the most correct decision and choice 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.189
 optimal design your 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.009
 crowns 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.929
 you should consult 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.929
 with your dentist 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.619
 and of course you yourself can decide 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.679
 what efforts will be made to 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.849
 to get the job done more 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.989
 aesthetic 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.080
 would be better suited to your color 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 and passed on all the features of your 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.060
 of teeth
