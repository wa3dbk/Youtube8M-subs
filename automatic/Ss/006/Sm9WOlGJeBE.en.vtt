00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:15.629
 hello for being his first interview 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.600
 and you have the same one 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:23.340
 Small gallery that is almost appstores 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.110
 want to buy your product for today 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.170
 we donate another 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.580
 yes that totally cool i have a video of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 her looked at modula a bit 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.960
 Tricks and let's say will hopefully 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.789
 Anyone from neuss would have if 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.800
 nobody comes but you do not believe that 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.720
 possible or no model I know 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 not if there are things that say 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.280
 people said you are 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.290
 stupid if now the ten people 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.970
 come and we have everything is somehow 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.440
 I know that is hopefully not so 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.440
 is the fear 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.690
 but that will not happen because you 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.360
 I have that at the video days 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.880
 mitgekriegt 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.600
 So far that was utopian that was 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.320
 insane 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.899
 they have jumped on you martinis 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 crass but what is that what does that mean 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.520
 Today for you on youtube you have to 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 Saying that is exactly what you are 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 very close to the community and that is 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.909
 otherwise only your community circles you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.300
 also experience live, they can really 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.860
 to see real people 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.120
 that's why it still does not work that way 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 also very first claim on the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.140
 street or something and if it often 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.490
 so addressed in berlin is 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.340
 Germany in general it is very 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.230
 good if not better but if 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.180
 I'm somewhere in the shopping center binder 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.920
 that's how it goes by now 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.210
 that it happens it is one too 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 learns about the time to certain views 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.760
 to interpret 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.470
 Well if a people address but you 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.690
 I think I have something completely 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.070
 weird face or thinking 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.070
 It usually works like that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.150
 So I looked back here 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.760
 with you on his youtube channel you have 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.640
 you have your first video almost four 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.720
 years highlandes decades 2010 yes 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.860
 totally blatantly hello people start serious 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.929
 I would like to try this one 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.960
 video for you to introduce yourself 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.660
 say what I want to do and that is 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.400
 not so easy 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.790
 So I know there is a million 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.320
 Thousands of gurus and makeup gravel and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.950
 Channels the most possible 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.940
 inform 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.340
 and now they are all coming 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.080
 Sit down , you have a seat 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.120
 At that time you thought that someday 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.830
 have success with youtube son 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 never I would not have thought either 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.860
 that I'll rent it from me someday 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.020
 Pay because I knew you could do it 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.060
 find money 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.880
 again and again today or even before that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.890
 Station you think that's where I sat 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.300
 this black day i would say i 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.830
 I'm not so much as a person 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.410
 really no one for me my friends 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.370
 but clearly how long with the camera 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 and son never would I have thought that 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.740
 you already have people in the first video 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.700
 said what you say 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:09.420
 hello people hello people 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.340
 charlotte driving people hello otto annoying 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.780
 But some meanwhile you have to 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.670
 We have that at our show 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 For example, we always say on 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.960
 always the same as the beginning of the show 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.160
 if you started with beauty like that 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.870
 more or less so you have then 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.880
 already announced that you on recipes 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.160
 and so we want to do what we do 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.350
 How did you decide? 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 what you do then that was one 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.410
 relatively easy decision because I 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.860
 I knew that I want to do it 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.070
 at that time it felt too comedy for me 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 music and beauty girls who and music 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.590
 I could offer really white now 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.110
 I do not consider myself to be comedy either 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.030
 especially talented there was the beauty 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.310
 somehow left over and how can you 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.770
 then so quiet blogs and stuff 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.530
 also to do with it is easy 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.540
 things like me if not even 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.090
 more interested seen 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.320
 I think that sanofi is possible 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.610
 Why should not I do everything with them 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.440
 share something 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.220
 because for that travel quite a large part 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.250
 of which its very big in the first video 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.470
 and said on this video you want 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.390
 like to share movies with him because you big 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.920
 filmfan're what's the last 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.590
 movie you have 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.820
 the last film in the cinema did not have that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.680
 very briefly I consider have a series 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.540
 The first thing you notice in any case 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.310
 Hornstein bought the second city is 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.600
 rooted all over from the front 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.370
 actually full of Sagittarius but me 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.080
 Did not think so that's it 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.410
 but not psychically 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:44.360
 He makes great actors and that was 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.360
 Yes OK
