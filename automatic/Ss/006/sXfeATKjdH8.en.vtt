00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
now this is going to be really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.330 
now this is going to be really

what<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.370> do<00:01:56.580> now<00:01:56.930> you're<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:58.200> ten<00:01:58.620> to

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
what do you do now you're down ten to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.910 
what do you do now you're down ten to
nothing<00:01:59.120> you're<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> playoff<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.200> think

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
nothing you're in the playoff I think

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740 
nothing you're in the playoff I think
you<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> kick<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.970> field<00:02:03.180> goal<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.540> think

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you have to kick the field goal I think

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.870 
you have to kick the field goal I think
so<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> board

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699 

that<00:02:08.390> doesn't<00:02:08.840> mean<00:02:08.959> if<00:02:09.140> that's<00:02:09.259> what<00:02:09.530> he's

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
that doesn't mean if that's what he's

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.490 
that doesn't mean if that's what he's
going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> think<00:02:10.190> though<00:02:10.690> fourth<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.989> goal<00:02:12.140> at

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
going to think though fourth and goal at

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.370 
going to think though fourth and goal at
the<00:02:12.709> one<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:14.260> little<00:02:15.260> bit

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the one and it really is a little bit

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.520 
the one and it really is a little bit
closer<00:02:15.680> than<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.330 

decided<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.190> for<00:02:21.550> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.920 

I'm<00:02:26.430> thinking<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.239> football<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.870> is

the field you know that's for show this

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.190
