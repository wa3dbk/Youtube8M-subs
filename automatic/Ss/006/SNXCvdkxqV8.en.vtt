that<00:00:24.779> unboxing<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.410> check<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
that unboxing go check it out and this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
that unboxing go check it out and this
came<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.670> huge<00:00:27.000> box<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.109> copies

came in a huge box for just two copies

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410 
came in a huge box for just two copies
it's<00:00:28.800> kind<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.099> ridiculous<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.849> huge<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.290 
it's kind of ridiculous how huge this
boxes<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:31.980> thinking<00:00:32.309> maybe<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.940> there's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
