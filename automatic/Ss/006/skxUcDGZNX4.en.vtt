fifty<00:01:31.340> degree<00:01:31.640> temperature<00:01:32.150> rating<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.600> it's

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
fifty degree temperature rating so it's

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.660 
fifty degree temperature rating so it's

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
left his spark plugs in place let's face

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.690 
left his spark plugs in place let's face
it<00:02:24.440> you're<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> replace<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.430> plugs

that's<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.030> consumable<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:26.959> he's<00:02:27.140> left<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's a consumable so he's left the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.110 
that's a consumable so he's left the
plugs<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:27.980> place<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.459> that's<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:28.940> keep

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
plugs in place and that's going to keep

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.059 
plugs in place and that's going to keep
paint<00:02:29.450> from<00:02:29.900> getting<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.410> into<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.770> spark

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
paint from getting down into the spark

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.010 
paint from getting down into the spark
plug<00:02:31.310> bore<00:02:31.550> or<00:02:31.790> into<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> combustion<00:02:32.840> chamber

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
plug bore or into the combustion chamber

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.080 
plug bore or into the combustion chamber
and<00:02:33.500> that's<00:02:33.620> never<00:02:33.950> good<00:02:34.220> these<00:02:34.640> are<00:02:34.670> easy<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and that's never good these are easy to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.150 
and that's never good these are easy to
take<00:02:35.209> out<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.569> it's<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.959> simple<00:02:36.350> masking<00:02:36.860> trick

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160
