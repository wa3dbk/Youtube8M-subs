00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 Oleg Nazarov back in 1951 to separate 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.309
 vascular insufficiency remain 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.809
 funds 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.299
 the experiment was a success 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.130
 but for the Russian scientist invention 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 shunting was not the main purpose of life 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.550
 this discovery became rather ordinary 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.289
 deputy of his writings 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 the main thing sought by the Soviet 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.859
 experimenters learn 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.289
 replant all vital 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.960
 bodies in the first place he always 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.390
 heart stood 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150
 a week later years 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 for the first time in the world made a transplant 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.450
 second extra 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.400
 heart by yourself 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.810
 donor heart stumbled and body 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.130
 the chest and the noble and instead 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.460
 one 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.290
 in the same 40 that Vladimir Petrovich 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.440
 carry out a more complex operation 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.350
 he is the first who makes independence 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.120
 my usual complex 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.120
 simplicity lived days it was a victory 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.700
 for such an experiment 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.559
 stalls developed a special technique 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:03.809
 allowing to produce 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.240
 transplantation without the use of the device 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.829
 cardiopulmonary bypass 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.829
 in 1947 scientists did 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.159
 I don't know 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.100
 rice heart of money rises to a new 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 stage of transplantology in 1954 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.240
 year need to look into the future 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.530
 he manages to make two years his dog 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.159
 the beginning of the big dog sewn golovan 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.330
 part of the torso of a small dog 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 started happened 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 each chapter after the operation remained 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 their former oracle 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840
 big drink you could not affect 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.970
 on a new part of your body 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.600
 little biting animal continued 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 aggressively 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.450
 and that's what's interesting 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.640
 today is experimenting 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.000
 was watching the process so 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.050
 called 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.800
 for example colleagues Dr. Velikhova 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.990
 noticed that the transplanted chapter 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.140
 old dog 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.440
 tarnished 6 in a week another 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.050
 was starting to shine 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.540
 obviously it was due to 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.200
 old head now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.900
 fully functioned on 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.400
 young theater 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.530
 like-minded faithful assistant money 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 in Vladimir Mikhalkin Gagarin was 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.419
 co-author of the experiment 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.699
 every experiment in a corner by a dog in 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.669
 about one month on average 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:17.939
 also in the number and because the most common 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.109
 Returned and not knowing useful sewn 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.109
 Goal 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.819
 consumers 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.929
 April 30 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.969
 was supportive of the talent of Vladimir 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.569
 t began to appear articles and but 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.159
 sincere in one then in the other goat 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.839
 this topic newsreel allowed scientists 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.540
 expressing your country 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.289
 present day 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.930
 We have to
