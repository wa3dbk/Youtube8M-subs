just<00:00:12.150> makes<00:00:12.420> building<00:00:12.870> such<00:00:13.259> user<00:00:13.500> interfaces

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
just makes building such user interfaces

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.300 
just makes building such user interfaces
really<00:00:15.120> simple<00:00:17.810> let's<00:00:18.810> start<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.650> creating<00:00:19.980> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
really simple let's start by creating a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.509 
really simple let's start by creating a
form<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.789> dragging<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.869> multi<00:00:22.230> button<00:00:22.590> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
form and dragging in a multi button we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
form and dragging in a multi button we
will<00:00:23.670> set<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> layout<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.960> box<00:00:25.260> while<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.830> out

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
will set the layout to box while a out

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.519 
will set the layout to box while a out
so<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> UI<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:27.539> more<00:00:27.840> familiar<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so the UI will look more familiar and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.470 
so the UI will look more familiar and

some user interface designs in that case

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.690 
some user interface designs in that case
we<00:01:07.700> can<00:01:08.240> also<00:01:08.570> reverse<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.710> first<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.310> second
