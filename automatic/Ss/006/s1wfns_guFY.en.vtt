00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
there and as you can see if I were to

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.379

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.469 
so I've actually marked out a little
line<00:05:38.339> right<00:05:38.639> there<00:05:38.819> that<00:05:39.029> I'm<00:05:39.089> going<00:05:39.209> to<00:05:39.269> cut

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
line right there that I'm going to cut

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.350 
line right there that I'm going to cut
off<00:05:39.629> steady<00:05:39.929> turns<00:05:40.319> easier<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.249> I've<00:05:41.999> also

and we're gonna work and see how well
that<00:06:07.800> does<00:06:08.419> I've<00:06:09.419> this<00:06:09.749> the<00:06:09.929> first<00:06:10.169> head<00:06:10.409> gate

00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:10.619 
that does I've this the first head gate

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.139 
that does I've this the first head gate
that<00:06:10.800> I'm<00:06:10.949> doing<00:06:11.099> so<00:06:11.489> I'm<00:06:11.759> gonna<00:06:11.879> have<00:06:12.029> to

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
that I'm doing so I'm gonna have to

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:13.850 
that I'm doing so I'm gonna have to
adjust<00:06:12.269> it<00:06:12.629> up<00:06:12.719> or<00:06:12.899> down<00:06:12.959> or<00:06:13.379> make<00:06:13.499> it<00:06:13.649> wider

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
adjust it up or down or make it wider

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.399 
adjust it up or down or make it wider
but<00:06:14.339> the<00:06:14.969> best<00:06:15.149> way<00:06:15.329> to<00:06:15.360> do<00:06:15.539> is<00:06:15.779> make<00:06:16.049> it<00:06:16.259> and

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
but the best way to do is make it and

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.589 
but the best way to do is make it and
then<00:06:16.499> throw<00:06:16.679> your<00:06:16.799> goat<00:06:17.009> up<00:06:17.189> in<00:06:17.309> here<00:06:17.699> and<00:06:17.879> see

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
then throw your goat up in here and see

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:29.180 
then throw your goat up in here and see
how<00:06:18.779> well<00:06:19.019> it<00:06:19.229> does

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.580 

alright<00:06:29.910> so<00:06:30.060> the<00:06:30.150> head<00:06:30.300> hole<00:06:30.510> is<00:06:30.960> completely

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
alright so the head hole is completely

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.490 
alright so the head hole is completely
cut<00:06:31.770> out<00:06:31.920> now<00:06:31.980> and<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:33.330> went<00:06:33.510> ahead<00:06:33.600> and<00:06:33.810> made<00:06:34.200> a

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
cut out now and I went ahead and made a

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.360 
cut out now and I went ahead and made a
simple<00:06:35.400> latch<00:06:35.910> system<00:06:36.450> and<00:06:37.080> it's<00:06:37.920> simply<00:06:38.340> just

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
simple latch system and it's simply just

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.940 
simple latch system and it's simply just
two<00:06:38.790> little<00:06:39.240> hooks<00:06:39.390> right<00:06:39.660> here<00:06:39.960> here<00:06:40.260> the

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
two little hooks right here here the

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.830 
two little hooks right here here the
reason<00:06:41.520> I<00:06:41.670> did<00:06:41.910> this<00:06:42.090> is<00:06:42.150> because<00:06:42.360> it's<00:06:42.750> very

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
reason I did this is because it's very

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.340 
reason I did this is because it's very
simple<00:06:43.380> and<00:06:43.650> a<00:06:43.890> cheap<00:06:44.220> method<00:06:44.550> and<00:06:45.120> I<00:06:46.020> attached

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
simple and a cheap method and I attached

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.710 
simple and a cheap method and I attached
this<00:06:46.650> one<00:06:46.890> to<00:06:47.130> the<00:06:47.250> headboard<00:06:47.730> and<00:06:48.090> then<00:06:48.540> this

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
this one to the headboard and then this

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.200 
this one to the headboard and then this
one<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:49.080> this<00:06:49.200> 2x4<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:50.190> it<00:06:50.580> helps<00:06:50.880> it<00:06:51.030> with

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
one to this 2x4 and it helps it with

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.370 
one to this 2x4 and it helps it with
from<00:06:52.200> pulling<00:06:52.530> away<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:53.040> opening<00:06:53.940> up<00:06:54.150> so<00:06:54.870> if

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
from pulling away and opening up so if

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.080 
from pulling away and opening up so if
you<00:06:55.440> get<00:06:55.680> it<00:06:55.770> just<00:06:55.800> to<00:06:56.070> this<00:06:56.310> one<00:06:56.580> it<00:06:56.970> would

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
you get it just to this one it would

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.270 
you get it just to this one it would
pretty<00:06:57.630> much<00:06:57.780> only<00:06:57.990> go<00:06:58.230> side<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.620> side<00:06:58.740> but

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
pretty much only go side to side but

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.450 
pretty much only go side to side but
having<00:07:00.150> it<00:07:00.240> attached<00:07:00.570> here<00:07:00.990> it<00:07:01.230> goes<00:07:01.560> helps

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
having it attached here it goes helps

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:14.860 
having it attached here it goes helps
with<00:07:02.580> it<00:07:02.820> going<00:07:03.090> in<00:07:03.210> and<00:07:03.330> out<00:07:03.420> and<00:07:03.750> opening
