start out here I wanted to show a rough

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.930 
start out here I wanted to show a rough
idea<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.820> how<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.120> came<00:00:15.330> boxed<00:00:16.279> I<00:00:17.279> didn't

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
idea of how it came boxed I didn't

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.490 
idea of how it came boxed I didn't
actually<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.390> unbox<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> don't<00:00:19.410> know

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
actually see it unbox so I don't know

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.759 
actually see it unbox so I don't know
exactly<00:00:19.619> how<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.220> was<00:00:20.310> packed<00:00:21.199> if<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.560> see

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
exactly how it was packed if you can see

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.529 
exactly how it was packed if you can see
here<00:00:23.269> it<00:00:24.269> has<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:26.390> styrofoam<00:00:28.189> cutout<00:00:29.539> holding

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
here it has a styrofoam cutout holding

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.700 
here it has a styrofoam cutout holding
it<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> bottom<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.380> may<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:31.650> been

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it at the bottom but there may have been

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.010 
it at the bottom but there may have been
something<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> top<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.540> there

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
something on the top as well and there

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.310 
something on the top as well and there
was<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:35.510> plastic<00:00:36.510> film<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.920> solar<00:00:38.160> panel

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
was a plastic film on the solar panel

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.510 
was a plastic film on the solar panel
protecting<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:42.590> I<00:00:43.590> wish<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.340> had<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
protecting it and so I wish I have had a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
protecting it and so I wish I have had a
chance<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> actually<00:00:45.180> unbox<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.200> show<00:00:46.379> how

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
chance to actually unbox it to show how

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.279 
chance to actually unbox it to show how
it<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.829> packed<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:48.899> now

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it was packed but this all I can do now

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
it was packed but this all I can do now
this<00:00:49.469> came<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.460> had<00:00:50.610> ordered<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.000> from

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
this came from we had ordered it from

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
this came from we had ordered it from
Amazon<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.649> ultimately<00:00:56.160> came<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:56.670> this

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
Amazon but it ultimately came from this

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.099 
Amazon but it ultimately came from this
place<00:00:57.260> a<00:00:58.260> reusable<00:00:59.300> revolution<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.660> there's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
place a reusable revolution and there's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.969 
place a reusable revolution and there's
a<00:01:01.170> website<00:01:01.379> right<00:01:01.770> there

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.940 

reusable<00:01:04.979> revolution<00:01:05.580> calm<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.799> they've

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
got stuff like this it's probably worth

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.429 
got stuff like this it's probably worth
going<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.130> checking<00:01:11.250> them<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:12.320> ironically<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
quite the size of a basketball but it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.469 
quite the size of a basketball but it's

made<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.720> China

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
made in China

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.270 
made in China
so<00:02:34.879> he's<00:02:35.090> possibly<00:02:35.690> can<00:02:36.260> paint<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:36.769> China

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
so he's possibly can paint it in China

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.630 
so he's possibly can paint it in China
and<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:38.360> don't<00:02:38.420> know<00:02:39.010> exactly<00:02:40.010> what<00:02:40.370> it's<00:02:40.519> made

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and I don't know exactly what it's made

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.020 
and I don't know exactly what it's made
out<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.849> but<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:43.069> feels<00:02:43.629> like<00:02:44.629> ceramic<00:02:46.030> of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
out of but it feels like ceramic of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.670 
out of but it feels like ceramic of
course<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.360> lot<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.599> things<00:02:47.780> these<00:02:47.959> days<00:02:48.019> feel

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
course a lot of things these days feel

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.479 
course a lot of things these days feel
like<00:02:48.739> ceramic<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:50.480> they're<00:02:50.750> not<00:02:51.129> but<00:02:52.129> look<00:02:52.280> at

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
like ceramic and they're not but look at

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.990 
like ceramic and they're not but look at
it<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.730> mean<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.030> thing<00:02:53.209> looks<00:02:53.239> great<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.940> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
it I mean this thing looks great and the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.520 
it I mean this thing looks great and the
back<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.510> there<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:03.170> would<00:03:03.410> look

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
back of it there so this would look

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.589 
back of it there so this would look
really<00:03:03.590> good<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.190> garden<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:08.540> course

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
really good in the garden and of course

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.629 
really good in the garden and of course
if<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.079> can<00:03:09.230> imagine<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.859> eyes<00:03:10.010> really<00:03:10.280> glare

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
if you can imagine the eyes really glare

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.050 
if you can imagine the eyes really glare
at<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.790> at<00:03:11.000> night<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:16.549> something<00:03:16.819> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
at you at night and it's something to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.009 
at you at night and it's something to
see<00:03:17.380> now<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.920> turn<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.310> on<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.840> don't

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
see now I can turn it on now it I don't

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.650 
see now I can turn it on now it I don't
think<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.260> has<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> photocell<00:03:22.480> probably<00:03:23.480> has<00:03:23.630> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
think it has a photocell probably has a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.259 
think it has a photocell probably has a
photo<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.169> let<00:03:24.349> me<00:03:24.410> see<00:03:24.470> if<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.739> can<00:03:24.889> turn<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.130> on

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.640 

yeah

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
yeah

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.089 
yeah
when<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> turn<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.069> on<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.430> just<00:03:31.669> is<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.569> on<00:03:32.720> I

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
when you turn it on it just is it on I

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.050 
when you turn it on it just is it on I
don't<00:03:34.099> think<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.459> when<00:03:34.609> we<00:03:34.669> try<00:03:34.849> covering

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
don't think it's on when we try covering

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.460 
don't think it's on when we try covering
me<00:03:35.389> yeah<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:36.049> we<00:03:36.139> go

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
me yeah there we go

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.900 
me yeah there we go
you<00:03:37.220> can<00:03:37.400> see<00:03:37.519> when<00:03:37.700> you<00:03:37.790> cover<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:39.819> when<00:03:40.819> you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
you can see when you cover the when you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.640 
you can see when you cover the when you
cover<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.450> solar<00:03:41.959> panel<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:43.489> turns<00:03:43.730> on

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.840 

so<00:03:47.650> there<00:03:47.800> must<00:03:47.890> be<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.130> photos<00:03:48.490> out<00:03:48.670> there

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
so there must be a photos out there

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.730 
so there must be a photos out there
somewhere<00:03:50.130> see<00:03:51.130> if<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.520> find<00:03:51.760> it

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
looking at the little screen it might be

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.130 
looking at the little screen it might be
plainly<00:03:59.950> obvious<00:04:03.570> don't<00:04:04.570> know<00:04:04.720> where<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:04.990> is

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
plainly obvious don't know where it is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.900 
plainly obvious don't know where it is
but<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.620> definitely<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.520> it<00:04:06.730> doesn't

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
but it is definitely there so it doesn't

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.820 
but it is definitely there so it doesn't
stay<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.270> all<00:04:07.450> day<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:10.470> let<00:04:11.470> me<00:04:11.530> show<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.770> the

I<00:05:03.300> just<00:05:04.300> watered<00:05:04.660> out<00:05:04.780> here<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.140> it's<00:05:05.260> sitting

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
I just watered out here and it's sitting

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.790 
I just watered out here and it's sitting
on<00:05:06.040> a<00:05:06.070> platform<00:05:07.169> and<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.470> got<00:05:08.710> the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
on a platform and so you got the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.760 
on a platform and so you got the
reflection<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> eyes<00:05:09.580> down<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.090> water

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
reflection of the eyes down in the water

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.989 
reflection of the eyes down in the water
and<00:05:11.770> try<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.070> zoom<00:05:12.340> in<00:05:12.550> on<00:05:12.640> those

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:20.999 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:27.029 

yeah<00:05:21.269> there's<00:05:21.509> reflected<00:05:22.079> eyes

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.159 

and<00:05:27.520> guess<00:05:27.669> what<00:05:27.909> I<00:05:28.089> do<00:05:28.270> now<00:05:28.509> is<00:05:28.719> zoom<00:05:28.900> in<00:05:29.020> on

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
and guess what I do now is zoom in on

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.439 
and guess what I do now is zoom in on
the<00:05:29.259> real<00:05:29.469> highs<00:05:30.869> which<00:05:31.869> is<00:05:33.089> challenging<00:05:34.089> the

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
the real highs which is challenging the

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.419 
the real highs which is challenging the
states<00:05:34.719> say<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.169> least

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:40.429 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:42.619 

really<00:05:41.429> look<00:05:41.610> like<00:05:41.819> it's<00:05:41.999> gonna<00:05:42.119> want<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.449> do

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
really look like it's gonna want to do

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.289 
really look like it's gonna want to do
that<00:05:42.779> let<00:05:43.080> me<00:05:43.139> try<00:05:43.349> to<00:05:43.789> turn<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.879> autofocus

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:45.299 
that let me try to turn the autofocus

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:51.679 
that let me try to turn the autofocus
off<00:05:46.549> it's<00:05:47.549> confused<00:05:49.819> just<00:05:50.819> do<00:05:51.029> that<00:05:51.179> manually

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
off it's confused just do that manually

00:05:51.689 --> 00:06:00.970 
off it's confused just do that manually
there<00:05:52.079> it<00:05:52.169> is

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.010 

so<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:01.640> should<00:06:01.910> be<00:06:02.030> able<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.240> get<00:06:02.390> a<00:06:02.450> bit<00:06:02.660> closer

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
so I should be able to get a bit closer

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:21.830 
so I should be able to get a bit closer
now

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.170 

so<00:06:22.380> anyway<00:06:23.010> this<00:06:23.190> thing's<00:06:23.430> really<00:06:23.730> neat<00:06:23.910> I

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
front card now where there's a lot of

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.360 
front card now where there's a lot of

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.810 
noise there's cars going by and dogs but
it's<00:06:53.370> an<00:06:53.490> example<00:06:53.669> of<00:06:55.280> what<00:06:56.280> it<00:06:56.400> looks<00:06:56.580> like

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
it's an example of what it looks like

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.610 
it's an example of what it looks like
with<00:06:57.090> the<00:06:57.240> rest<00:06:57.419> of<00:06:57.540> the<00:06:57.630> solar<00:06:57.870> lights<00:06:58.110> and

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:17.550 

how<00:07:01.620> big<00:07:01.800> it<00:07:01.919> is

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.570 

down<00:07:18.560> there

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.730 

how<00:07:22.580> about<00:07:22.820> that<00:07:23.060> huh

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.170 

anyway<00:07:29.640> I<00:07:29.850> guess<00:07:30.180> that<00:07:30.420> wraps<00:07:30.630> it<00:07:30.840> up<00:07:31.940> it<00:07:32.940> turns

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
anyway I guess that wraps it up it turns

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.380 
anyway I guess that wraps it up it turns
out<00:07:33.300> to<00:07:33.420> be<00:07:33.450> a<00:07:33.570> really<00:07:34.940> really<00:07:35.940> neat<00:07:36.120> little

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.390 
out to be a really really neat little
