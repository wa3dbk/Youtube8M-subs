00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.540
 the schedule for the hockey world cup in the hague is during a press conference 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.309
 argentina south africa the new zealand korea 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:13.049
 Germany 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.859
 national coach paul van ass is satisfied with the trainer the third match germany 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.800
 is particularly beautiful is also a good moment in the group stage 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.019
 then you know immediately that you are standing together eleven years in a row for the top 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.949
 top matches 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.150
 and I am very happy with that also robert van der horst and internationals 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.140
 marcel balkestein looks good sitting there are certainly good then you know 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.860
 in the matches in the world cup are all really top matches 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.149
 his work in easy competitions at buts 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 yes as it looks now and with the start and finally on in Germany 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.740
 Friday and you look good thalys ipod first 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.440
 and the family's intestines especially Germany just halfway the the pool 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.010
 to have 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 he is a nice prospect you are all talking about that match 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.810
 against germany has well i find and and match against germany at a world cup 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.900
 own country you just belong to this choice but know a group with the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.740
 Ticket sales for the World Cup go very well in the final minute of the exact schedule 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.460
 is known 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.780
 wanted to sell an extra boost 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 that means packed stadium regret wk impe landed that has internationals 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.530
 A lot of energy is really looking forward to it when we watch the matches 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.980
 are all sold out 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.000
 so you can again play with 15 thousand people in your own country 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.910
 and as far as I am concerned, no extra pressure, but very beautiful and in twelve 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.350
 anneke ranzato will be called and will be there 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.750
 this is fantastic to play in your own country in such a big stadium 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 yes but then we just have to be able to make our own house and that starts 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.630
 were actually back at the first game with a passion and energy that we 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.990
 We have tried to surrender something to the public in large numbers 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.360
 come across the cane tulip of getting when the opponent is eventually 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 feel wonderful imported yes wonderful I must honestly say the atmosphere 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.010
 and ambiance and also the approach of this wk 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.180
 also through the room bnn everything that comes my way is so incredible 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.759
 beautiful 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.289
 it is the third time in their own country that a World Cup is allowed to play that will certainly work 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.950
 From now on, the World Cup hockey club can also be downloaded on your smartphone 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.959
 it shows all competitions and all the world news and that world cup is always coming 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.360
 closer to the internationals we can't wait yes but I work 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.509
 what I try to grab a title like eggs in my own house 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:21.469
 Few years ago in the final text is that bullets this happens in the galgenwaard 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.839
 but that has been a source of inspiration for me personally, including me 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.919
 hope I can experience the same loans on the field the wk in the hague 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.149
 anything from 31 May to 15
