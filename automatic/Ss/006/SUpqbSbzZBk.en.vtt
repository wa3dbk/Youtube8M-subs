00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 now I'm marcus column and welcome 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.800
 in this video update of the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.950
 series in the last and with our heel 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 beautiful volcano therefore therefore that du 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.680
 first to show you what I have 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.060
 done the giusy sees a glimpse of it 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.519
 I would like to open a parenthesis on the fact 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.730
 which ultimately actually in the last 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.689
 video in which said just a lot of fin 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.540
 people told me wood alive Leo 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.059
 machinery traced the fact that 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 machinery is a somewhat uncertain concept 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 because actually there is no 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.539
 machinery is also a plant for making 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.020
 the bees I turn to these children 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.680
 spoiled that I just break the balls 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.960
 I don't do videos for work 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.379
 I take them as a hobby I take a lot of time 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.859
 the action I can guarantee one thing 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 in a few there is a programming 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.290
 which assures you two videos a day 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.000
 always at the hour and a half and at half past six 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.590
 of which the first central minecraft series 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 to the others they are random and you don't have to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.369
 bomb alarm the fucking boys 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.820
 honestly I do what I do 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.009
 like it 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 I do what I like and come back from 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.780
 work i'm tired i start to register 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.700
 and relax, relax, relax 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 so when you say it is enough but not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 break the balls don't watch the video 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.619
 if very simply I do a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.049
 example when two years ago a year ago a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.579
 year and a half ago discovered minecraft cleansed 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.259
 following luke there were parts where 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.229
 that made liuc that I didn't like 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 maybe I know but here is also a lot 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.880
 recently, however, I am quite 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.460
 big boy 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.490
 fashion is the one with strange monsters that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 was the grandfather I did not like and watched 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.000
 another hour because I should have gone 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.739
 to write no were not europe 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.069
 but if he has fun with that but not 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.390
 break the fuck people I'm sorry 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.970
 be vulgar and hard but this is it 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.120
 that alive he said do not behave like 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.099
 spoiled children who claim why 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.780
 what you see is free 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.940
 what you see is the fruit of labor 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.870
 of the commitment and passion of the other 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 person 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.799
 so in that case the video is not there 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 please close the video anyway said 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.010
 that I do not know if I have already said it in 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.680
 some comment I think so I don't 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:51.140
 I intend to have children 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:54.170
 never is one of the things I hate the most 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 complaint of a spoiled child 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.709
 so please tend to have a big one 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.079
 tolerance level but then it became 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.569
 really really bad so not 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.060
 break my soul for a long time I accept 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.840
 very willingly advice but 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.139
 impositions to the type if you don't do this 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 he told me write mandate fuck off eve of 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.250
 block the cern and I care sorry 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.540
 I do n't live with youtube 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.489
 I really hope as a personal goal 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.810
 that you following my videos of 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.000
 follow why you like me I don't 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.350
 like what I do ie I hope that 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.930
 you also like what I do 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.489
 so I'm sorry a little about it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.829
 which put a lot of fun because 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.019
 I've always underestimated it like le 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.910
 bees that are actually giving me 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.950
 way to see what can be done 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.440
 very large systems that is, this is a 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.430
 mr plant and is only made for 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.230
 the bees come so under the date also from 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.639
 I really regret it, I understand 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.190
 that 50 85 99 percent of those who 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.720
 they say enough there is that they fail to 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.750
 understand it 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.700
 that is, I can't really understand the mod 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.160
 there are people who say they are useless and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.390
 in fact I absolutely want 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.370
 confirm that they are useless indeed 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.310
 are two days which is stationary 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:25.670
 the stone the gloss and see you have me 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:27.890
 only made 259 plus 1234567 stacks of 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.550
 in fact they are useless then 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.990
 one is written via diamond here and goes on 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.420
 diamond com and right click 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.220
 let's see if that is the video that the 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.430
 diamond combo give him the time part of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.750
 call d'aste the technician diamond dust e 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.120
 four of them give you a diamond 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.690
 dust which in reality then should be compressed 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.270
 becomes a diamond ie I spoke for 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 ignorance is just stupid me 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.290
 I will continue to use the bees in 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.240
 this mode because it is present in this 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.810
 series because I practically decided to 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.340
 focus on the bees but creating gods 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.529
 vicious circles and installations like 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.039
 the one that I present to you for now 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:16.909
 make things love in minecraft that second 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.079
 me one was cool we said that 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.909
 this video update is about 

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.819
 especially this facility that you 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:27.899
 I'll show you but I wo n't explain everything 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:30.839
 which produces sapling and sunflower seeds e 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:35.489
 the wheat that the composter produces for us 

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:39.629
 the compound is called the compost 

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:41.429
 forgive me that it is being destroyed 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.799
 that cancer is turned into 

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.789
 biomass that ends up in here 

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:47.429
 transformed by these two engines 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:52.169
 connected to a bit of wilde thousand ea 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:54.869
 some solar panels here davis il 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.839
 always of the forestry they transform the 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:06:01.259
 sending biomass except mint a very good one 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:03.239
 you can pass but I fly hop that 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.299
 feed a great boyle mistake that 

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:09.599
 they feed these steam is already in fact 

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:12.989
 how are these qua industrial steam 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:15.619
 engine that actually from the whole energy 

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:18.779
 all this complex and to this 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:20.459
 liquid DNA disintegrator though 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.189
 unfortunately now it has stopped because here 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.219
 it's all full this will serve us for 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.739
 stay in extremis 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.449
 let's go this way I had this plant 

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:32.879
 done already see initially 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.939
 it simply produces bees that echo 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.769
 of end up inside the nyse that 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:39.779
 they finish by joe and give us the liquid 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:42.899
 dni all the rest of the body ends here 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.729
 inside and goes to make the king 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:46.529
 here I am forming bees then 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.529
 you will see in the series trick and track e 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.619
 hand grenades and we don't just do it 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:54.950
 manouba washbasins as you will see today 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:57.710
 because I think I publish it 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.210
 let's say on this day they will do you 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.330
 see how he built this 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.090
 beautiful building we have 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.290
 renamed as the mortuary mines 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.000
 then then grapes intend to do 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.180
 something I didn't know then 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.620
 asking for her bonn 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.690
 this is what we have done 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.730
 other little things I have a lot of projects in 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.200
 mind including a very farm 

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.570
 interesting of diamonds because such 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.910
 must be said but no but do as in the technique 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.310
 cast does the diamond volcano and I don't 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:28.450
 I can accept that anyway I go back to 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:31.280
 repeat I make youtube for passion 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.340
 mainly I already have a job I am not 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.550
 required to fulfill anyone's wishes 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.680
 if I can gladly listen to yours 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.330
 tips and I put them into practice is a 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.290
 Lots of people a lot of people can 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.370
 witness the whining of children 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.210
 spoiled 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.290
 rather not the spoiled children they do 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.710
 all these years stay 

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:59.830
 I don't know what to do with it for sure 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.830
 to see the salami with tear
