00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to your vilsack let's play 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.240
 the game before you two devices two 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.010
 iPhone seems to be both 5s but in fact 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.990
 In fact, one of them is five from this angle 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.210
 it's not easy to make out who's a day but I 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 I hope you got 5 on the right 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.049
 could be distinguished at least by 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 silver edging lightning in general 5s 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 externally differs from the five 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.529
 flashes work he color space gray and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.140
 sensor tachadi and what you see 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 on the left it used to be white iphone 5 then I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.130
 put the green case on him then 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 safely smashed the screens in the end he 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 turned into such a thing which 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 looks like 5s but except 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.260
 no label and other flash 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 In general, it turned out very well and why 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 why from what why now I will tell 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 Apple discounts went to all subscribers 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.719
 from partner and apple store just.ru then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 time i came wai support what 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.829
 will later look like an iphone 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.539
 5s of course it was a pitiful wife 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.520
 which used this phone 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 smashed the screen more green 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.180
 custom case as you will see began 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.160
 fade and many have asked me what 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 In this case, do set custom 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.790
 corps it turned out to be nothing defective 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 come to the service center and you without it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 problems will change at least so me 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040
 said guys from aysa so far 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 I actually have a body replacement 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.460
 it turned out free and although it was 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 opportunity to put a little red or 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 blue body I decided my miserable 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.159
 iphone 5 make like 5s 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.080
 I am often asked to go to 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.549
 service centers to change 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.009
 housing or can be ordered in china 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 for example for $ 100 and now rest 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.740
 do it at home if hands what 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 called grow from the right place 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 why not but there is a danger because 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.710
 All these buildings are assembled in China 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.479
 the quality they have is very floating and it can 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 happen that from a party of 10 pieces 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.680
 half with marriage unpainted with 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.299
 scratches with any defects or 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.280
 generally a funny story like mine when 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.049
 the body over time began to lose color and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.790
 now your head is throbbing at all 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.710
 why the hell so izgalyatsya and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 trying to make some kind of iphone 5 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.329
 replica 5s understand that takachidi given 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.119
 the case does not work and it is a pure model 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.579
 take your work iphone 5 change it in 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.330
 case 5s obviously did not become on my case 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.580
 when was 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.560
 the case and the screen seems to me that this 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.690
 quite a good option because color 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 space gray is generally very, very nice 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.920
 better than the original black fives 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 Moreover, if it is worth the jailbreak 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.850
 roll emulation takachidi when clamped 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 their keys it leads to unlocking 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.340
 devices 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.620
 Naturally, if you closely examine 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.240
 my freshly picked iphone 5s can 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.730
 see the difference is not an absence 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 service badges have enclosures with no 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.630
 someone like more in the first 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.730
 the queue is a flash in the original 5s 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.830
 it is double and extended in my case 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.020
 it is round although the master sawed off all 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.790
 Chrome is still a key tachadi in my case 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.380
 different it has a pronounced 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.660
 bezel in the original it is not so 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.610
 frank I don't know about you, but I honestly 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.250
 it seems to be fun at 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.880
 least my miserable green broken 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.160
 iphone 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.110
 found the normal form of money and the whole 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 this operation will cost as replacement screens 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.890
 the hull no pitfalls and 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.170
 write your opinion in the comments 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.880
 did you like my custom or not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.610
 the coolest if we get 20,000 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.020
