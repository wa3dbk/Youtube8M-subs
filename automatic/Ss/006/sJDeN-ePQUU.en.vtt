00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.920 
be as wide as possible and so when you
run<00:01:36.399> it<00:01:36.549> feels<00:01:36.820> like<00:01:37.090> you're<00:01:37.299> you're<00:01:37.570> moving

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.139 
run it feels like you're you're moving
very<00:01:38.140> fast<00:01:38.530> even<00:01:39.100> though<00:01:39.250> in<00:01:39.520> actuality

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
very fast even though in actuality

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.929 
very fast even though in actuality
you're<00:01:40.509> actually<00:01:41.040> covering<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.250> same<00:01:42.579> exact

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
you're actually covering the same exact

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.730 
you're actually covering the same exact
amount<00:01:43.210> of<00:01:43.299> distance<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.899> are<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.290> console

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659
