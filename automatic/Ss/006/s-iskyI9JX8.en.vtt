model<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.160> format<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> FBX<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
model and you know the format is FBX you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.479 
model and you know the format is FBX you
can<00:00:40.879> open<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.149> unity<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.800> also<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
can open it in unity but you can also of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.990 
can open it in unity but you can also of
course<00:00:44.660> load<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.200> Lightwave<00:00:47.070> both<00:00:47.550> layout

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
course load it in Lightwave both layout

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
course load it in Lightwave both layout
and<00:00:48.329> model<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.460> know

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and model there so you can you know

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
and model there so you can you know
adapt<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.899> rig<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> model<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.230> edit

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
adapt the rig to to the model or edit

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.130 
adapt the rig to to the model or edit
the<00:00:55.680> model<00:00:56.100> rest<00:00:56.550> pose<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.600> once<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.079> have

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the model rest pose so once you have

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.459 
the model rest pose so once you have
placed<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.129> FBX<00:00:59.609> file<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.899> content

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
placed the FBX file in your content

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.700 
placed the FBX file in your content
directory<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.910> load<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:04.350> scene<00:01:06.710> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
directory you can load it as a scene the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
directory you can load it as a scene the
FBX<00:01:08.250> file<00:01:08.580> contains<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> informations

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
FBX file contains all the informations

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.690 
FBX file contains all the informations
needed<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.130> build<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.659> scene<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.140> Lightwave

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
needed to build the scene in Lightwave

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
needed to build the scene in Lightwave
so<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> mesh<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.630> its<00:01:15.960> UV<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
so now the mesh with its UV and the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.050 
so now the mesh with its UV and the
texture<00:01:18.390> images<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.619> joints<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.280> loaded

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
texture images and the joints are loaded

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.289 
texture images and the joints are loaded
into<00:01:21.270> layout<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.530> rig<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:22.950> compatible<00:01:23.939> with

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
into layout this rig is compatible with

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.020 
into layout this rig is compatible with
the<00:01:25.110> mecha<00:01:25.350> name<00:01:26.119> system<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:28.350> unity<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the mecha name system in in unity but of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.200 
the mecha name system in in unity but of
course<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.500> animate<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> my<00:01:32.850> hand

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
course if you want to animate it my hand

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.120 
course if you want to animate it my hand
while<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> using<00:01:35.930> FK

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
while you have to to do that using FK

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.780 
while you have to to do that using FK
the<00:01:38.130> genomically<00:01:38.850> unity<00:01:39.560> preset<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:41.549> really

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the genomically unity preset can really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.200 
the genomically unity preset can really
help<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.420> make<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.350> animation<00:01:43.770> process<00:01:44.210> more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
help to make the animation process more

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230 
help to make the animation process more
easy<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.930> straightforward<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> let's<00:01:47.970> load

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
easy and straightforward so let's load

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
easy and straightforward so let's load
the<00:01:48.570> mash<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:50.070> modeler<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.920> layer<00:01:52.920> two<00:01:53.250> we're

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the mash in modeler and layer two we're

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.800 
the mash in modeler and layer two we're
going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.979> load<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:57.000> genomic<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.420> unity

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
going to load the genomic to unity

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.859 
going to load the genomic to unity
preset<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:59.219> should<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.549> played<00:01:59.790> in<00:02:00.030> g-tube

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
preset you should have played in g-tube

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.709 
preset you should have played in g-tube
bipeds<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.659> here<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.869> genomic<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.710> unity

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
bipeds and here it is genomic to unity

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.309 
bipeds and here it is genomic to unity
by<00:02:06.719> bird<00:02:07.069> so<00:02:08.069> let's<00:02:08.399> adapt<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.209> rig<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
by bird so let's adapt this rig to the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.130 
by bird so let's adapt this rig to the
mesh<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.890> background<00:02:11.510> let's<00:02:12.510> start<00:02:12.750> turning

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
mesh in background let's start turning

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.559 
mesh in background let's start turning
on

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
on

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.309 
on
symmetry<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.329> from<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.420> front<00:02:16.659> view<00:02:16.749> I'm

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
symmetry and from the front view I'm

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.839 
symmetry and from the front view I'm
going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.680> select<00:02:19.260> Flags<00:02:21.480> moved<00:02:22.480> in<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:25.469> this

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
going to select Flags moved in like this

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.709 
going to select Flags moved in like this
and<00:02:27.849> more<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:30.340> I'm<00:02:30.639> going<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:30.909> drag<00:02:33.719> this

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
and more and then I'm going to drag this

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.670 
and more and then I'm going to drag this
point<00:02:35.590> here<00:02:36.629> do<00:02:37.629> not<00:02:37.659> forget<00:02:38.109> to<00:02:38.170> keep<00:02:38.439> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
point here do not forget to keep the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.489 
point here do not forget to keep the
pole<00:02:38.920> vector<00:02:39.180> aligned<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.709> legs<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:43.499> in

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:44.499 
pole vector aligned to the legs and in

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.319 
pole vector aligned to the legs and in
front<00:02:44.889> of<00:02:45.129> the<00:02:45.310> leg<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.790> course

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
front of the leg of course

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:54.920 
front of the leg of course
so<00:02:47.079> let's<00:02:47.260> go<00:02:47.379> on<00:02:47.939> adapting<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:52.030> legs<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
so let's go on adapting the legs to the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:04.680 
so let's go on adapting the legs to the
mesh<00:02:55.930> from<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.439> side<00:02:56.709> view

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.380 

yeah<00:03:05.380> there<00:03:05.560> should<00:03:05.680> be<00:03:06.720> nice<00:03:07.720> enough<00:03:09.390> let's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
yeah there should be nice enough let's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
yeah there should be nice enough let's
work<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.190> arms<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.780> I'm<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:16.830> move

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
work on the arms so I'm going to move

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.090 
work on the arms so I'm going to move
the<00:03:20.410> arms<00:03:20.830> like<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:25.440> want<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.500> rotate

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
the arms like that and I want to rotate

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.100 
the arms like that and I want to rotate
them<00:03:29.430> okay<00:03:32.130> let's<00:03:33.130> go<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.460> side<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:35.080> can

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
them okay let's go on the side we can

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
them okay let's go on the side we can
see<00:03:35.560> this<00:03:37.890> elbow<00:03:38.890> needs<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.460> be<00:03:39.640> aligned<00:03:41.130> well

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
see this elbow needs to be aligned well

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.920 
see this elbow needs to be aligned well
that's<00:03:42.430> right<00:03:42.720> nice<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:46.320> old<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.930> should

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
that's right nice and old so and should

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.450 
that's right nice and old so and should
be<00:03:50.050> moved<00:03:51.480> wait<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.510> beat<00:03:54.510> now<00:03:55.510> let's<00:03:55.840> think<00:03:56.590> to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
be moved wait a beat now let's think to

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.420 
be moved wait a beat now let's think to
the<00:03:57.550> body<00:03:59.280> we<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.870> eyes<00:04:02.050> here<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.310> will

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the body we have the eyes here that will

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.660 
the body we have the eyes here that will
not<00:04:03.610> be<00:04:03.760> used<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.420> we<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.250> lead<00:04:06.460> them

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
not be used so we can just to lead them

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.530 
not be used so we can just to lead them
and<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.890> course<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:09.250> going<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:10.260> select<00:04:12.540> those

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and of course I'm going to select those

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.450 
and of course I'm going to select those
bones<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:15.450> Center<00:04:16.890> pelvis<00:04:18.299> with<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.330> beat

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
bones and Center pelvis with a beat

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.730 
bones and Center pelvis with a beat
not<00:04:21.460> just<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:24.370> position<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> neck<00:04:25.740> and

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
not just the position of the neck and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.310 
not just the position of the neck and
the<00:04:26.830> head<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:32.080> well<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.890> should<00:04:33.100> work

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
the head like this well that should work

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.280 
the head like this well that should work
now<00:04:35.320> if<00:04:35.590> we're<00:04:35.800> planning<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.520> use<00:04:36.760> AI<00:04:37.120> K<00:04:37.420> to

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
now if we're planning to use AI K to

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.550 
now if we're planning to use AI K to
animate<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.970> model<00:04:40.390> what<00:04:41.230> we<00:04:41.260> have<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:42.250> set<00:04:42.700> a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
animate this model what we have to set a

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.330 
animate this model what we have to set a
preferred<00:04:44.560> angle<00:04:45.480> for<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.600> for<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.080> legs<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
preferred angle for the for the legs the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.900 
preferred angle for the for the legs the
arms<00:04:48.370> are<00:04:48.940> okay<00:04:49.360> they<00:04:49.630> are<00:04:49.690> bent<00:04:50.250> but<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.700> see

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
arms are okay they are bent but you see

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.780 
arms are okay they are bent but you see
the<00:04:52.030> leg<00:04:52.180> is<00:04:52.330> straight<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:53.800> we<00:04:54.340> need<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.670> do

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
the leg is straight so we need to do

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.290 
the leg is straight so we need to do
something<00:04:55.210> that's<00:04:56.130> set<00:04:57.130> both<00:04:57.460> layers<00:04:57.820> in

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
something that's set both layers in

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:08.260 
something that's set both layers in
foreground<00:04:59.100> and<00:05:03.390> I'm<00:05:04.390> going<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.750> select

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.730 

the<00:05:09.270> lag<00:05:10.220> like<00:05:11.220> this<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.990> skeletons<00:05:13.500> of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
the lag like this and the skeletons of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:20.629 
the lag like this and the skeletons of
course<00:05:14.129> and<00:05:14.690> then<00:05:15.690> I'm<00:05:16.169> going<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.770> rotate<00:05:19.639> from

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
course and then I'm going to rotate from

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.920 
course and then I'm going to rotate from
the<00:05:20.879> side<00:05:21.569> view<00:05:25.009> like<00:05:26.009> this<00:05:26.280> about<00:05:26.669> minus<00:05:27.569> 12

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
the side view like this about minus 12

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.159 
the side view like this about minus 12
degrees<00:05:29.720> then<00:05:30.720> all<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.680> do<00:05:31.830> is<00:05:32.220> to

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
degrees then all I have to do is to

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.430 
degrees then all I have to do is to
select<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:36.419> part<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.680> leg<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:39.440> rotate

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
select this part of the leg and rotate

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:50.059 
select this part of the leg and rotate
again<00:05:41.060> this<00:05:42.060> time<00:05:43.069> 12<00:05:44.069> degrees<00:05:48.440> so<00:05:49.440> now<00:05:49.620> we<00:05:49.680> can

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
again this time 12 degrees so now we can

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:58.700 
again this time 12 degrees so now we can
see<00:05:51.229> we<00:05:52.229> have<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:54.180> preferred<00:05:54.719> angle<00:05:55.969> for<00:05:57.710> for

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
see we have the preferred angle for for

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.050 
see we have the preferred angle for for
the<00:05:58.800> legs<00:05:59.009> maybe<00:05:59.419> it's<00:06:00.419> even<00:06:00.960> not<00:06:01.110> enough<00:06:02.060> but

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
the legs maybe it's even not enough but

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.180 
the legs maybe it's even not enough but
we<00:06:03.240> will<00:06:03.419> verify<00:06:03.659> that<00:06:04.129> so<00:06:05.129> let's<00:06:05.310> cut<00:06:05.909> and

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
we will verify that so let's cut and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.490 
we will verify that so let's cut and
paste<00:06:08.780> the<00:06:09.780> two<00:06:09.960> layers<00:06:10.190> layer<00:06:11.190> one<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:12.500> can

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
paste the two layers layer one I can

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.769 
paste the two layers layer one I can
save<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.610> object<00:06:14.759> and<00:06:15.330> send<00:06:15.840> it<00:06:15.960> to<00:06:15.990> layout

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:28.219 

okay<00:06:22.069> so<00:06:23.069> here<00:06:23.490> we<00:06:23.520> can<00:06:23.940> use<00:06:25.520> create<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> rig<00:06:27.229> to

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
okay so here we can use create a rig to

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.120 
okay so here we can use create a rig to
have<00:06:28.529> the<00:06:28.710> recreated

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.750 

in<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:33.970> next<00:06:34.240> video<00:06:34.360> we'll<00:06:34.690> verify<00:06:35.200> the<00:06:36.160> rig

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
in the next video we'll verify the rig

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.530 
in the next video we'll verify the rig
and<00:06:37.300> we'll<00:06:37.570> test<00:06:38.290> and<00:06:38.680> describe<00:06:39.280> the<00:06:39.940> controls

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
and we'll test and describe the controls

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.440 
and we'll test and describe the controls
you<00:06:40.810> can<00:06:40.870> use<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.830> animate<00:06:42.340> it<00:06:42.520> thanks<00:06:43.300> for

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
you can use to animate it thanks for

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.840 
you can use to animate it thanks for
watching
