00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.260
 the missives today I bring to the recipe 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.540
 of the egg-free coconut ice cream so it's 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.940
 very easy to do and very rich I hope that 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 you like, we start with a cup of 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.270
 brown sugar would be also placing 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.720
 a grated cocoa rate ground one 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.240
 cup of milk cream two cups of 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.000
 normal milk for placing a can 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.550
 also of coconut milk and a splash 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.550
 vanilla first I will place the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.010
 two cups of milk in a container for 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 so I can mix everything and I'll be 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.120
 placing the sugar and / or brown milk 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.530
 because I like the taste and color more 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 what you give but you can use 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.120
 white sugar and let's move all this 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 very well until the blue sugar 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.590
 then it dissolves completely then 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.380
 I will be placing what is the can of 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.750
 coconut milk and we will keep moving 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.120
 all very well until there are no more 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.040
