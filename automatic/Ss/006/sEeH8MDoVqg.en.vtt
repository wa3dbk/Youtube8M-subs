itself is about 1,600 feet
which<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> pretty<00:03:00.010> substantial<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:01.270> you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
which is a pretty substantial your you

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.480 
which is a pretty substantial your you
know<00:03:02.040> doing<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:04.740> what<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.770> do<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:06.010> little

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
know doing it for you what I do a little

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.490 
know doing it for you what I do a little
bit<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.940> train<00:03:07.180> his<00:03:07.330> theory<00:03:07.720> boots<00:03:07.990> on<00:03:08.140> inside

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
bit to train his theory boots on inside

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.230 
bit to train his theory boots on inside
usually<00:03:08.800> about<00:03:09.100> four<00:03:09.340> or<00:03:09.400> five<00:03:09.520> times<00:03:09.850> and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
usually about four or five times and

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.620 
usually about four or five times and
then<00:03:10.960> get<00:03:11.830> better<00:03:12.160> right<00:03:12.370> afterwards<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.210> that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
then get better right afterwards so that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.700 
then get better right afterwards so that
kind<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.110> reasoning<00:03:14.290> with<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.920> know<00:03:15.120> 12

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
kind of reasoning with you know 12

climbing this look out right there and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.050 
climbing this look out right there and
