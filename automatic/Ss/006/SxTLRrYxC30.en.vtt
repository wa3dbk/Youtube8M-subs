other than that I mean you know I

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.480 
other than that I mean you know I
surround<00:02:00.619> myself<00:02:00.650> with<00:02:00.920> good<00:02:01.040> people<00:02:01.159> that

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
surround myself with good people that

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.249

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you know it doesn't seem authentic it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.740 
you know it doesn't seem authentic it
doesn't<00:02:47.459> come<00:02:47.550> across<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.880> way<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.569> doesn't

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
doesn't come across that way it doesn't
