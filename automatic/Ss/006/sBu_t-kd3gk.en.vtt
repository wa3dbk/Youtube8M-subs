the<00:02:09.950> thesis<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.130> book<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.540> can

the<00:02:15.000> future<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.540> what<00:02:15.720> gives<00:02:15.930> time<00:02:16.320> its<00:02:16.740> arrow

is<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.240> about<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.680> deep<00:02:23.040> forward

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
