00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.220
 Warfare 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.470
 aaa at the web 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.530
 I have told you in detail, but from now on I want to tell you various parts of running 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.700
 I think this car Harrier's hybrid 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:57.020
 This is a 2-liter Nick ff model 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:02.750
 I would like to travel around the city ​​and the expressway and tell about the difference in riding quality etc. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:09.460
 Running around the city, you feel better now. 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:15.909
 Quietness which might be better to say taking the even more accurate to ride the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:23.200
 Although there is little direct impact which enters the body when overcoming the sachet 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:26.920
 As the sensation that the sound of Don that resonates in the room is very small, as a sense 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 I really feel comfortable riding hard 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:38.799
 After all hybrid'll This is perhaps one of the benefits of the things that made the hybrid 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:44.229
 Speaking of which it makes the interior very much because it makes the silence very much , the sound insulation material or the sound insulation with the insulator 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:46.940
 Such materials are being introduced more and more into this gasoline model, resulting in quietness 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.550
 Resulting in better ride comfort as experience 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.270
 There is such a thing to feel 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.870
 Even if it sees from a while ago, it does not exceed 2000 rotation and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.000
 That is why it is generally quiet and fine 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.540
 After all , it is one element of luxury cars, but I have to increase the engine speed. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.990
 say 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.990
 By the way I came to the highway now 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:18.680
 There is a climax feeling of that child, is n't it? 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.990
 Beth book strongly when stepping on the accelerator 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.910
 Only tachometer comes up and it does not go up at a stretch, but the speed goes up 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.600
 It's coming up gradually x Geo in together with the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.600
 Power board 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.350
 Ooh 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.130
 Oh power power mode 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.350
 I feel it is good 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.790
 I've never used to cvt and I have not felt it raining, but I think it feels good 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.920
 that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.430
 At the moment of about 6,000 revolutions in the par mode, the red zone is roughly 6,400 revolutions 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 Is it about? 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.599
 It jumps up to around 6,000 yen at a stretch, but this engine at that time 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.870
 Uplifting feeling or sound of blowing up 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.630
 response 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:09.490
 This is something sporty car 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:12.670
 Not you say that 150 horsepower little I for this vehicle weight is my little powerless feeling 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.250
 I thought there was no such thing 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.680
 As we use the delicious place of the engine firmly 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.920
 I think that or not than cvt uncomfortable ride without quite ran towards the love you were this 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.920
 I will 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.640
 I am running a general road 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:35.130
 More than anything 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.850
 It's easy to control the speed. 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.240
 I will 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:46.620
 Such a large suv's body accelerates now by stepping on the accelerator at will 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:53.310
 If you want to be a bit smoother acceleration starts 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:55.739
 After all, this is still momentarily say Rutte put out the torque at will motor unique 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.799
 It is attractive 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.959
 Even though it says the car of hybrid all 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:06.580
 Such that in particular I wonder if there is no tuning and Tanja something aware of around the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:13.810
 I feel the feeling 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:18.040
 It has the power to spare and it looks like you're riding a large displacement car 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.579
 I'm packing machine, but that feeling of stability I felt 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:27.370
 This is what a hybrid can do 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:31.120
 The weight of the battery and the motor and also the rear is increasing. 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.830
 There is such a sense of stability that has been pressed from the jealousy and 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.800
 This is One in the sense of security even when running long distances 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 I think it is an element to go up 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.870
 The shock of time to get over only after all heavy minute when exceeded or the joint of the road surface 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.689
 Is a little big 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:56.279
 The kana come momentarily more and more entered 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:58.930
 The sound is heard in the car a little , but this can be said to sound because the sound is quite quiet 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:05.830
 I think though 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:07.479
 Considering the ride only, the lighter gasoline finished better 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:14.500
 You can say that 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:18.920
 Speaking of flat roads, if you prefer hybrids, people who run a lot of rough roads will be the opposite 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.760
 Of gasoline models kana and quality of such glue coach differences and say to 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.020
 I There 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.020
 Acceleration feeling Toka is 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:32.570
 Yaba power shake salt 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:36.170
 Another of v6 par of that Sendai 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.780
 Even though it should not be enough to say violent 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.280
 but 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:48.790
 You can say that this is enough 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:55.930
 Click here First I'm not worried about Woba to say that because gasoline model 2-liter sufficient Pafuru 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:06:02.300
 In cvt i is smart and not attractive in hybrids as lightness and high speed 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:07.250
 I feel that rise blows good feelings I luck to wonder if here is good if to drive myself 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:11.090
 Though Tteyuu is there any impression Well wonder if recommended to hybrid what kind of person 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.629
 Speaking of reminiscences of characters, the power of the motor is still attractive 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.590
 Ne 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:22.289
 Guigui us running strong Toka Toka slow in the city 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:26.249
 Of course there is 2.5 liters of power on the highway, so it is more powerful 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:31.770
 I can go up without stress and rise without stress and without stress 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:35.849
 I think that I can say such a thing, so if you go on a long-distance road with a highway or something 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:40.800
 After all the power of the margin is attractive, isn't it? 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.280
 I there is this kind of impression Toka not stepped to enter Oh also want brake crawl at or slightly downhill degree 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.580
 But conversely that 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:50.710
 The weight is heavy on the highway or in the city, and the car will run smoothly and moist 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.540
 Produces an effect 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:58.500
 So it may be a bit like a luxury car if you say something else 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.950
 This may also be true if you take a back seat 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:07.610
 Difference of each riding taste which told now 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.610
 We are advised to choosing a car while it to the reference 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.589
 Five
