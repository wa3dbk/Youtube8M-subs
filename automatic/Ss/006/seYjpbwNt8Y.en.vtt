all there all BMW that's one thing that
hasn't<00:01:33.240> gone<00:01:33.509> away<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.530> we've<00:01:34.650> done<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
hasn't gone away I think we've done a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
hasn't gone away I think we've done a
very<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.430> job<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
very good job and that's what was the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.039 
very good job and that's what was the
feedback<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> car<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
feedback that I get that the car is very

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.700 
feedback that I get that the car is very
much<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.759> design<00:01:42.049> interior<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.380> fact<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
much like design interior the fact that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.950 
much like design interior the fact that
we<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.640> lines<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:45.810> offer

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
we have different lines that we offer

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.130 
we have different lines that we offer
now<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.560> different<00:01:47.329> interior<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.840> exterior

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
now so different interior and exterior

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
now so different interior and exterior
ways<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.340> interpret<00:01:50.610> these<00:01:51.030> three<00:01:51.450> series<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
ways to interpret these three series and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.819 
ways to interpret these three series and
and<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:54.090> fuel<00:01:54.329> economy<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.780> mean<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.470> ultimate

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and the fuel economy i mean the ultimate

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.730 
and the fuel economy i mean the ultimate
driving<00:01:55.979> machine<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:57.020> not<00:01:58.020> only<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> ultimate

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
driving machine is not only the ultimate

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.350 
driving machine is not only the ultimate
driving<00:01:58.860> machine<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.520> also<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.030> ultimate
