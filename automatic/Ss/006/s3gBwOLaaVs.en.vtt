00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
get those fancy lines and stripes in

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.360 
get those fancy lines and stripes in
your<00:02:27.489> field<00:02:27.730> for<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:28.000> game<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:29.230> some<00:02:29.980> teams<00:02:30.160> go

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
your field for a game and some teams go

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.130 
your field for a game and some teams go
a<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.550> more<00:02:30.730> extreme<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.209> others<00:02:31.450> we've

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
a little more extreme the others we've

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.559 
a little more extreme the others we've
typically<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:32.739> do<00:02:32.950> straight<00:02:33.280> lines<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
typically just do straight lines and the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.089 
typically just do straight lines and the
biggest<00:02:34.900> question<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.410> all<00:02:35.560> get<00:02:35.770> is

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
biggest question we all get is

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.860 
biggest question we all get is
turf<00:02:36.280> managers<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.880> how<00:02:37.330> do<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> make<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
turf managers is how do you make the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.500 
turf managers is how do you make the
different<00:02:38.620> shades<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.040> graphs<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:40.060> know<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
different shades of graphs you know the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.000 
different shades of graphs you know the
simple<00:02:40.840> answer<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.260> just<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.590> rollers<00:02:41.980> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
simple answer is just the rollers that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.100 
simple answer is just the rollers that
are<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.400> our<00:02:42.550> mowers<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.330> actually<00:02:43.750> lay<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
are on our mowers that actually lay the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.800 
are on our mowers that actually lay the
grass<00:02:44.290> down<00:02:44.590> as<00:02:45.190> we<00:02:45.430> go<00:02:45.550> one<00:02:45.760> direction<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.630> you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
grass down as we go one direction as you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.910 
grass down as we go one direction as you
turn<00:02:46.989> around<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.290> come<00:02:47.410> back<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.680> other<00:02:47.709> way

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
turn around and come back the other way

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680 
turn around and come back the other way
it<00:02:48.489> lays<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.730> grass<00:02:49.060> down<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.540> other

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
it lays the grass down the other

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.050 
it lays the grass down the other
direction<00:02:50.340> giving<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.550> illusion<00:02:51.640> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
direction giving it the illusion that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.240 
direction giving it the illusion that
the<00:02:52.300> grass<00:02:52.510> is<00:02:52.650> different<00:02:53.650> shades<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.010> green

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the grass is different shades of green

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.309 
the grass is different shades of green
but<00:02:55.120> it's<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.569> way<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.840> light<00:02:56.050> is

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
but it's just the way the light is

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.199 
but it's just the way the light is
hitting<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.800> grass<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.819> gives<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.180> that

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
hitting the grass that gives it that

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.680 
hitting the grass that gives it that
illusion<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.590> as<00:03:00.519> far<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.760> mowing<00:03:01.030> patterns<00:03:01.510> go

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
illusion so as far as mowing patterns go

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.570 
illusion so as far as mowing patterns go
we'd<00:03:01.989> like<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.319> change<00:03:02.560> our<00:03:02.860> mowing<00:03:03.190> patterns

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
we'd like to change our mowing patterns

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.729 
we'd like to change our mowing patterns
at<00:03:03.700> least<00:03:03.910> every<00:03:04.209> three<00:03:04.420> or<00:03:04.450> four<00:03:04.569> days<00:03:04.870> just

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
at least every three or four days just

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.410 
at least every three or four days just
so<00:03:05.890> we're<00:03:06.040> not<00:03:06.069> laying<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.730> grass<00:03:07.000> down<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
so we're not laying that grass down the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.650 
so we're not laying that grass down the
same<00:03:07.660> direction<00:03:07.930> all<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.319> time<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.880> off<00:03:10.360> days

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
same direction all the time on off days

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.050 
same direction all the time on off days
we<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.049> completely<00:03:11.290> different<00:03:11.739> direction

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
we go a completely different direction

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.789 
we go a completely different direction
for<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> for<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.600> three-game<00:03:14.049> series<00:03:14.319> we<00:03:14.620> might

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
for a for a three-game series we might

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.070 
for a for a three-game series we might
memo<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.430> grass<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.850> same<00:03:16.090> direction<00:03:16.420> all

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
memo the grass the same direction all

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.110 
memo the grass the same direction all
three<00:03:17.440> nights<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.980> then<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.670> next<00:03:18.819> three

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
three nights and then for the next three

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.030 
three nights and then for the next three
games<00:03:19.269> we'll<00:03:19.540> change<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.989> direction<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.709> go

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
games we'll change the direction and go

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.890 
games we'll change the direction and go
a<00:03:21.069> completely<00:03:21.250> different<00:03:21.819> direction<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.750> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
a completely different direction just to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.710 
a completely different direction just to
keep<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.230> grass<00:03:23.440> growing<00:03:23.830> upright<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.720> so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
keep that grass growing upright and so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.240 
keep that grass growing upright and so
it<00:03:25.810> doesn't<00:03:26.110> get<00:03:26.170> trained<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.799> start<00:03:27.010> laying

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it doesn't get trained and start laying

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.130 
it doesn't get trained and start laying
down<00:03:27.430> last<00:03:28.299> thing<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.570> want<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.019> have

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
down last thing you want to do is have

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.810 
down last thing you want to do is have
your<00:03:29.260> grass<00:03:29.410> lay<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.400> then<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.579> can<00:03:30.730> no

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
your grass lay down and then you can no

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.949 
your grass lay down and then you can no
longer<00:03:31.030> get<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> nice<00:03:31.450> clean<00:03:31.810> cut<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.170> it

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
longer get a nice clean cut on it
