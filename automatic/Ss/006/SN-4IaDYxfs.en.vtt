right<00:02:40.640> now<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:41.110> InDesign<00:02:42.110> as<00:02:42.830> far<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.160> this

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
right now in InDesign as far as this

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.660 
right now in InDesign as far as this
game<00:02:43.790> games<00:02:44.030> when<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> play<00:02:44.870> about<00:02:45.670> canceled

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
it's actually quite useful it opens up

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.530 
it's actually quite useful it opens up
the<00:02:51.860> game<00:02:52.010> quite<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> little<00:02:52.580> bit

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the game quite a little bit

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.430 
the game quite a little bit
interesting<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.630> am<00:02:54.750> i<00:02:54.780> doing<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.080> right<00:02:55.200> here

that airs okay you have to put you have
to<00:03:02.400> attack<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.360> jump<00:03:03.720> like<00:03:04.110> almost

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
to attack and jump like almost

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.500 
to attack and jump like almost
immediately<00:03:05.160> at<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.400> same<00:03:05.550> time<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
immediately at the same time but the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.910 
immediately at the same time but the
jump<00:03:06.750> comes<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.110> little<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.380> later<00:03:07.560> there<00:03:07.830> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
jump comes a little bit later there you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.790 
jump comes a little bit later there you
go<00:03:08.060> ok<00:03:09.060> ok<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.600> suit<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.990> San<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.650> he<00:03:10.710> does

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
go ok ok I suit your San so he does

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760 
go ok ok I suit your San so he does
almost<00:03:10.950> kind<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.400> half<00:03:11.610> jump<00:03:12.000> and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
almost kind of like a half jump and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.870 
almost kind of like a half jump and
attacks<00:03:13.770> much<00:03:14.040> sooner<00:03:14.340> than<00:03:14.490> what<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.760> was

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
attacks much sooner than what I was

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.690 
attacks much sooner than what I was
doing<00:03:15.150> that's<00:03:15.450> subtle<00:03:15.720> damn<00:03:16.190> subtle<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.550> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
doing that's subtle damn subtle but you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.260 
doing that's subtle damn subtle but you
can<00:03:17.850> do<00:03:18.090> any<00:03:19.050> attack<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.730> using

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
can do any attack that you can do using

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.060 
can do any attack that you can do using
that<00:03:21.510> way<00:03:21.720> Oh<00:03:22.070> interesting<00:03:24.830> ok<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:25.890> you're

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
that way Oh interesting ok so you're

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.500 
that way Oh interesting ok so you're
starting<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.580> attack<00:03:26.940> move<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.330> then<00:03:27.420> you're

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
starting the attack move and then you're

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.210 
starting the attack move and then you're
jumping<00:03:28.020> your<00:03:28.110> character<00:03:28.590> while<00:03:28.800> he's<00:03:29.040> doing

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
jumping your character while he's doing

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.700 
jumping your character while he's doing
a<00:03:29.370> ground<00:03:29.820> attack<00:03:29.970> mode<00:03:30.440> right<00:03:31.440> because

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
a ground attack mode right because

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.490 
a ground attack mode right because
essentially<00:03:32.220> no<00:03:32.720> jumping<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.020> before

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
essentially no jumping but then before

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.380 
essentially no jumping but then before
you<00:03:34.920> become<00:03:35.250> heir<00:03:35.430> stance<00:03:35.700> you're<00:03:35.880> attacking

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
you become heir stance you're attacking

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.890 
you become heir stance you're attacking
so<00:03:36.990> um<00:03:37.920> by<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.820> narrate<00:03:39.240> very<00:03:39.420> nature<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
so um by the narrate very nature of the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.690 
so um by the narrate very nature of the
game<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.500> existed<00:03:41.070> because<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.580> are

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
game this existed because there are

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.220 
game this existed because there are
steps<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.300> game<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.870> don't<00:03:43.020> want<00:03:43.170> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
steps in the game and you don't want to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.230 
steps in the game and you don't want to
like<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.620> somebody<00:03:43.830> walk<00:03:44.580> off<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.970> steps

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
like have somebody walk off the steps

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.700 
like have somebody walk off the steps
and<00:03:45.390> all<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> sudden<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:45.960> an<00:03:46.080> air<00:03:46.260> attack<00:03:46.350> so

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
and all the sudden do an air attack so

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.380 
and all the sudden do an air attack so
there's<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.950> threshold<00:03:47.250> between<00:03:47.670> ground

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
there's a threshold between ground

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.150 
there's a threshold between ground
stances<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.990> there's<00:03:49.170> mixels<00:03:49.530> this

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
stances and there's mixels this

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.120 
stances and there's mixels this
threshold<00:03:50.460> actually<00:03:51.030> creates<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.690> sort<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
threshold actually creates this sort of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.310 
threshold actually creates this sort of
Aaron<00:03:53.130> Allah<00:03:53.340> emergent<00:03:54.090> gameplay<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:55.020> it's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
Aaron Allah emergent gameplay like it's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.200 
Aaron Allah emergent gameplay like it's
sort<00:03:55.740> of<00:03:55.860> because<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.610> rules<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.090> way

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
sort of because of the rules the way

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.140 
sort of because of the rules the way

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
the other areas are actually taking

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.530 
the other areas are actually taking
place<00:04:14.160> within<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.790> map<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.209> awesome

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
place within this map that's awesome
