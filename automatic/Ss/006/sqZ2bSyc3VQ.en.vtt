thirty percent dry it's a little is

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.680 
thirty percent dry it's a little is
still<00:03:46.200> wet<00:03:46.500> obviously<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.670> let<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.880> air<00:03:48.660> dry

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
still wet obviously and I let it air dry

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.200 
still wet obviously and I let it air dry
for<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.290> thirty<00:03:50.070> minutes<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.520> an<00:03:50.640> hour<00:03:50.820> until

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
for like thirty minutes to an hour until

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.030 
for like thirty minutes to an hour until
I<00:03:51.630> feel<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.870> it's<00:03:52.200> I'm<00:03:52.350> finally<00:03:52.710> dry

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.740 
I feel like it's I'm finally dry
completely<00:03:53.400> because<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.880> does<00:03:54.090> dry<00:03:54.330> faster

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
completely because it does dry faster

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.030 
completely because it does dry faster
when<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> give<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.230> head<00:03:55.350> start<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.680> diffuser

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
when I give it a head start the diffuser

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.010 
when I give it a head start the diffuser
and<00:03:56.190> then<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.700> go<00:03:56.820> back<00:03:56.850> an<00:03:57.270> hour<00:03:57.390> later<00:03:57.510> or<00:03:57.840> 30

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
and then I go back an hour later or 30

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.500 
and then I go back an hour later or 30
minutes<00:03:58.320> later<00:03:58.560> depending<00:03:58.800> on<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.850> fast<00:04:00.120> or

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
minutes later depending on how fast or

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.970 
minutes later depending on how fast or
if<00:04:00.870> I'm<00:04:00.990> rushing<00:04:01.320> or<00:04:01.410> something<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:01.890> then

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
if I'm rushing or something and then

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.860 
if I'm rushing or something and then
just<00:04:02.190> do<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.310> same<00:04:02.780> diffusing<00:04:03.860> steps
