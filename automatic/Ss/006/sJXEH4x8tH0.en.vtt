00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.710 
thinking I was almost done and I wanted
to<00:01:52.460> finish<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.820> out<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.360> really<00:01:53.420> what

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
to finish it out and that's really what

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.560 
to finish it out and that's really what
led<00:01:53.870> to<00:01:53.900> my<00:01:54.050> other<00:01:54.500> two<00:01:54.680> mistakes<00:01:55.040> when<00:01:55.400> you're

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
led to my other two mistakes when you're

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.150 
led to my other two mistakes when you're
up<00:01:56.570> on<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.720> ladder<00:01:56.960> or<00:01:57.170> drilling<00:01:57.620> overhead<00:01:58.040> for

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
up on a ladder or drilling overhead for

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160 
up on a ladder or drilling overhead for
that<00:01:58.310> matter<00:01:58.490> even<00:01:59.120> from<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.360> ground<00:01:59.570> level<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
that matter even from the ground level I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.630 
that matter even from the ground level I
need<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.710> keep<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.950> drill<00:02:01.100> above<00:02:01.310> your<00:02:01.460> head

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
need to keep the drill above your head

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.330 
need to keep the drill above your head
when<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.480> built<00:02:02.690> down<00:02:02.870> up<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
when the built down up it just the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.310 
when the built down up it just the
torque<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:04.940> ripped<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.660> drill<00:02:05.900> right<00:02:06.200> out

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
torque just ripped the drill right out

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.600 
torque just ripped the drill right out
of<00:02:06.380> my<00:02:06.500> hand<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> that<00:02:07.040> drill<00:02:07.250> swung<00:02:07.490> around

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
of my hand and that drill swung around

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.310 
of my hand and that drill swung around
the<00:02:07.820> battery<00:02:08.119> pack<00:02:08.330> hit<00:02:08.540> me<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.750> face

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
the battery pack hit me in the face

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.440 
the battery pack hit me in the face
third<00:02:10.190> mistake<00:02:10.369> because<00:02:10.730> I<00:02:10.850> really<00:02:11.210> wasn't

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
third mistake because I really wasn't

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.060 
third mistake because I really wasn't
using<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.960> right<00:02:12.110> tool<00:02:12.350> for<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.590> job<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.830> was

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
using the right tool for the job I was

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.620 
using the right tool for the job I was
using<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.310> Dewald<00:02:13.760> cordless<00:02:14.180> drill<00:02:14.450> which

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
using that Dewald cordless drill which

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.980 
using that Dewald cordless drill which
is<00:02:14.780> fine<00:02:15.020> for<00:02:15.320> some<00:02:15.590> applications<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:16.400> I

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
is fine for some applications but I

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.870 
is fine for some applications but I
really<00:02:17.990> needed<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:19.130> know<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> corded<00:02:19.670> drill<00:02:19.850> I

had one sitting right there next to the
cordless<00:02:21.770> drill<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.010> got<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> nice<00:02:22.459> Milwaukee

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
corded drill takes a little bit longer

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.910 
corded drill takes a little bit longer

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.580 

okay<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:36.910> I've<00:02:37.300> pushed<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.080> bowls<00:02:38.320> through

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
okay so I've pushed the bowls through

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.590 
okay so I've pushed the bowls through
the<00:02:38.680> holes<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.640> install<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.150> brackets

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
the holes here to install the brackets

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.810 
the holes here to install the brackets
just<00:02:41.440> use<00:02:41.620> some<00:02:41.830> blue<00:02:42.010> tape<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.310> hold<00:02:42.640> those

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
just use some blue tape to hold those

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.340 
just use some blue tape to hold those
bolts<00:02:43.210> in<00:02:43.360> till<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> can<00:02:43.900> get<00:02:43.960> up<00:02:44.080> there<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.290> the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
bolts in till I can get up there in the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.940 
bolts in till I can get up there in the
attic<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.800> put<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.700> nut<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.330> washer<00:02:47.320> on<00:02:47.710> and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
attic and put the nut and washer on and

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.510 
attic and put the nut and washer on and
tighten<00:02:48.220> those<00:02:48.310> down<00:02:49.770> okay<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.280> see

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
tighten those down okay so you can see

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.460 
tighten those down okay so you can see
where<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> bolts<00:02:52.360> protrude<00:02:53.050> back<00:02:53.230> through

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
where the bolts protrude back through

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.650 
where the bolts protrude back through
these<00:02:53.590> cross<00:02:53.920> members<00:02:54.180> I've<00:02:55.180> already<00:02:55.420> got<00:02:55.540> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
these cross members I've already got the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.400 
these cross members I've already got the
washers<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.260> nuts<00:02:56.320> on<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:57.700> we're<00:02:57.880> secure<00:02:58.410> on

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
washers and nuts on so we're secure on

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.010 
washers and nuts on so we're secure on
both<00:02:59.680> sides<00:03:00.010> uh<00:03:00.340> this<00:03:01.030> swing<00:03:01.360> would<00:03:01.600> probably

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
both sides uh this swing would probably

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.940 
both sides uh this swing would probably
hold<00:03:02.080> King<00:03:02.410> Kong

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
hold King Kong

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.880 
hold King Kong
so<00:03:03.450> one<00:03:04.450> other<00:03:04.570> thing<00:03:04.810> I've<00:03:04.930> done<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:05.860> I

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so one other thing I've done is when I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.010 
so one other thing I've done is when I
cut<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.340> deck<00:03:06.640> out<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.910> cut<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.360> flush<00:03:07.750> with

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
cut this deck out I cut it flush with

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.840 
cut this deck out I cut it flush with
the<00:03:09.270> joist<00:03:10.270> here<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.720> I've<00:03:10.840> scabbed<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the joist here so I've scabbed on a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.780 
the joist here so I've scabbed on a
couple<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.910> pieces<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.270> two<00:03:13.510> by<00:03:13.690> fours<00:03:14.790> just

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
couple of pieces of two by fours just

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.729 
couple of pieces of two by fours just
along<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.300> joist<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.230> when<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.380> lay<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
along this joist so that when I lay the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.130 
along this joist so that when I lay the
deck<00:03:17.950> back<00:03:18.160> on<00:03:18.430> top<00:03:18.670> I'll<00:03:19.600> have<00:03:19.840> something<00:03:20.050> to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
deck back on top I'll have something to

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.810 
deck back on top I'll have something to
screw<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.470> down<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.860> I'll<00:03:21.130> probably<00:03:21.370> leave

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
screw it down to I'll probably leave

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.390 
screw it down to I'll probably leave
this<00:03:22.030> off<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.860> couple<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.890> days<00:03:24.010> make<00:03:24.280> sure

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
this off for a couple of days make sure

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.650 
this off for a couple of days make sure
we<00:03:24.489> don't<00:03:24.640> need<00:03:24.730> any<00:03:24.910> adjustments<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.510> our

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
we don't need any adjustments with our

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.440 
we don't need any adjustments with our
swing<00:03:27.600> okay<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:28.660> we've<00:03:28.900> installed<00:03:29.260> our<00:03:29.500> spring

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
swing okay so we've installed our spring

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.940 
swing okay so we've installed our spring
ours<00:03:31.450> comes<00:03:31.690> with<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.870> giant<00:03:32.080> hook<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.800> then

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
ours comes with a giant hook and then
