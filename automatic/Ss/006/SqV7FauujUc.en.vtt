hello YouTube it's 903 Lu here with a
question<00:00:11.920> and<00:00:12.100> that<00:00:12.129> question<00:00:12.519> is<00:00:13.440> liner-lock

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
question and that question is liner-lock

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.380 
question and that question is liner-lock
frame<00:00:16.090> lock<00:00:16.390> which<00:00:17.169> one<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:17.560> stronger<00:00:17.800> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
frame lock which one is stronger and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.179 
frame lock which one is stronger and
indeed<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.660> there<00:00:20.020> that<00:00:20.470> big<00:00:20.800> a<00:00:20.860> difference

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
indeed is there that big a difference

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.290 
indeed is there that big a difference
all<00:00:21.700> other<00:00:21.880> things<00:00:22.180> being<00:00:22.330> equal

all other things being equal
conventional<00:00:25.300> wisdom<00:00:25.689> would<00:00:26.439> have<00:00:26.739> it<00:00:27.899> that

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
conventional wisdom would have it that

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.679 
conventional wisdom would have it that
the<00:00:29.050> frame<00:00:29.320> lock<00:00:29.590> is<00:00:29.950> the<00:00:30.369> stronger<00:00:30.790> lock<00:00:31.000> it's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
the frame lock is the stronger lock it's

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.740 
the frame lock is the stronger lock it's
a<00:00:31.989> much<00:00:32.380> much<00:00:32.710> beefier<00:00:33.640> piece<00:00:33.969> of<00:00:34.210> steel<00:00:34.480> or

the blade and well it says itself really

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.720 
the blade and well it says itself really
it's<00:00:43.750> half<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.410> knife<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.579> lock

it's half of the knife that is the lock
itself<00:00:46.060> whereas<00:00:46.540> with<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> liner<00:00:47.110> lock<00:00:49.350> as

itself whereas with the liner lock as
you<00:00:50.620> can<00:00:50.829> see<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.780> just<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:53.290> tiny<00:00:54.130> little

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you can see it's just a tiny little

narrow piece of steel or titanium that's
interacting<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.380> it<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.680> just<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.100> liner<00:01:00.399> it's

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
interacting and it is just a liner it's

two<00:01:07.090> screws<00:01:07.479> I<00:01:09.689> am<00:01:10.689> wondering<00:01:11.229> however<00:01:11.679> is

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:11.889 
two screws I am wondering however is

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.840 
two screws I am wondering however is
that<00:01:12.100> always<00:01:12.429> the<00:01:12.850> case<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:15.310> other<00:01:15.549> things

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
that always the case all other things

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.599 
that always the case all other things
being<00:01:15.999> equal<00:01:16.560> surely<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.770> point<00:01:18.069> of<00:01:18.310> failure

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
being equal surely the point of failure

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.539 
being equal surely the point of failure
of<00:01:20.819> this<00:01:21.959> Kershaw<00:01:22.959> leak<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.439> most<00:01:24.280> other

looks usually have the same cutout this
skyline<00:02:05.469> doesn't<00:02:06.929> but<00:02:07.929> usually<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.470> has<00:02:08.619> the

and lion locks before me I'd say they're

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.870 
and lion locks before me I'd say they're
roughly<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:25.460> same<00:02:25.730> way

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.000 
the lock had broken while he was abusing
it<00:02:47.600> yes<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:49.430> had<00:02:49.550> failed<00:02:49.730> right<00:02:50.300> here

it yes and it had failed right here
which<00:02:52.010> led<00:02:52.640> me<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.930> start<00:02:53.930> thinking<00:02:54.500> that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
which led me to start thinking that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:02.710 
which led me to start thinking that
surely<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.380> area<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.070> knife<00:02:59.560> here<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
surely the area of the knife here the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.830 
surely the area of the knife here the
width<00:03:03.020> of<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.470> piece<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:04.070> steel<00:03:04.840> is

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
width of this piece of steel is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.580 
width of this piece of steel is
irrelevant<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:07.070> strength<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.730> lock

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
irrelevant for the strength of the lock

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160 
irrelevant for the strength of the lock
yes<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.920> will<00:03:10.220> mean<00:03:10.580> that<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.930> frame

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
yes it will mean that it is the frame

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.450 
yes it will mean that it is the frame
