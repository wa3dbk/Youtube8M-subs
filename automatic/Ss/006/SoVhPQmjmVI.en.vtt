also has the lower zoom natural scope

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.940 
also has the lower zoom natural scope
there<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.540> preferably<00:00:37.320> need<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> use<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
there is I preferably need to use the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.530 
there is I preferably need to use the
variable<00:00:38.370> zoom<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
variable zoom with it this is the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
variable zoom with it this is the
regular<00:00:39.899> scope<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> reason<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.790> have

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
regular scope the reason I don't have

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
regular scope the reason I don't have
the<00:00:42.030> variable<00:00:42.239> zoom<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the variable zoom on this is because of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
the variable zoom on this is because of
cash<00:00:43.710> problems<00:00:44.160> motherfucker<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> bank<00:00:45.360> a
