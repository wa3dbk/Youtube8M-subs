00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.040
 Hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.590
 come back with another tutorial for you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.080
 This time my friend tonight I split 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.740
 tutorial on two rates did the part of the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
 and separate skin because I wanted to 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.880
 I can explain to you rightly 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.160
 step by step to not have anyone send 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 close very fast, so today I go 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.080
 put the part of your eye over there and there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.300
 in the middle of the week puts part of the skin 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.460
 It was good because the skin explains well 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 for you how do I prepare for 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.710
 skin for the night what I use so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 Just as I do and I explained well 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.940
 It 's the same for you, the eye is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.950
 well explained very slowly to you 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.079
 can learn even role that you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 Like this, I put it like a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.770
 makeup to put us on a lipstick 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.540
 bar was one of those to raze the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.969
 true no button I spent only one 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.950
 lipstick with a gloss I'll go 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.729
 I'll tell you why I just did it and he 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:11.210
 no skin then you are these two here is 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 the apex rpb da coppe the milani's gloss 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 in the color of the lactte rykiel na and if this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.800
 beautiful brightness is not this hope you guys 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 Let's start then the first 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.789
 thing to do is always pass the weather 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.369
 for makeup to last 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.190
 I'll use an orange shade with a 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.610
 foamy brush and I'm going to start 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:37.020
 applying on the concave, fading very well 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.009
 this shadow will only be the basis of our 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.340
 make up 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.039
 so it will not be appearing then with 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 The cutest brush your makeup goes 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.090
 stay softer application will not stay 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.599
 softer then I 'll come back with a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.479
 darker brown shade and apply on the 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.179
 the outer corner of the eye and pulling 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.130
 inside only in the concave in the eyelid 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.610
 so I 'll apply it in the outer corner 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 or pulling out and applying 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.330
 concave 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.550
 From there to the eyelid we're going to 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.430
 or if you have a 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.040
 something like that passes by nixon 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.500
 in the inner corner with a brush and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.189
 cat but then you will have to take 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.460
 be careful not to pull 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.410
 totally for the external field 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.930
 I'm just going to give a little light 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.300
 with a finger to merge this bit 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 brown shadow with this concealer 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.650
 I'm going to spend a champagne shadow 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.230
 only place we passed the corrective 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.980
 or played because you will pass in the corner 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.570
 internal 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.450
 I'm using a cat tongue brush 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.120
 also because it helps in the accuracy of 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.490
 elvira head work application for 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.440
 apply close to the eyelashes is the same 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.990
 thing I'm going to do in the other eye 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 when you get close to the outside corner 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.220
 A little careful not to pay 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.250
 both the darkest shadow but the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.410
 pay is only you come back with the brush and 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.110
 do not melt in the outer corner 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.500
 From there to go under, I'm going to use a 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.440
 brush I have more chatinha and thinner 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.050
 it will help make the application more 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.690
 need to get under the eye 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.870
 It is not easy and I will first pass that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.970
 and then I'm going to spend one or 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 Darker it 's the same thing as me. 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.790
 I did the top part of the contest 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.330
 that's when I 'll get past the outline 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.180
 I in that little brush because he's kind 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.670
 see then it helps in the application 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.010
 I always trade doing the singing. 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.780
 external first then the gift pulled 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.510
 see where you need to stay 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350
 And then I draw bringing procampo. 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.940
 internal 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.200
 I like to make this inner corner 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.390
 also for what delma elongated in the look and 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.030
 I come back with that same dark shadow 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.150
 the dark brown and I apply in the corner 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.040
 pulling upwards from the concave 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.040
 to end the shadows 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.750
 there I will come back with a more 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.970
 dark and apply well close to lashes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.639
 to further clarify the root 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.680
 because I will not pass the black pencil 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.180
 in fact I'm going to spend another pencil 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.250
 the beige pencil 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.590
 it grows clear that I do not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.450
 I need it but I think it looks pretty good. 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.310
 with this makeup as we did 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.010
 delineated well inside 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.370
 I'll pass an illuminator down the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.500
 eyebrow is not white is a bed well 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.530
 clarense what gives you another one illuminated 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.830
 one purse rather than one light shade 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:53.200
 It's clear from there that I always like 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.330
 come back with that same brush I 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.330
 I used to pass above the Congo and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.360
 to cover up this month 's 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.640
 up with the dark using curvex as 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.810
 always because I 'm not without and passing 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.030
 by the eyelashes 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.040
 I'm wearing the berdan sex mask 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.700
 secret in the mass is only you to start well 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.550
 at the root of the eyelashes and swings 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.990
 back and forth and up and then pull to 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.540
 I like to make the outside corner 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.430
 I'll brighten up that same one too. 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.300
 shadow that I do not even under eyebrow 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.370
 illuminate the inner corner of the eye and there're 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.370
 ready soon ready the eye 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.000
 so this is it I do not expect much from you 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.680
 have enjoyed and wait for the 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.600
