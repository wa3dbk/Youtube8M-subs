the luggage it is blue and really
spacious<00:01:06.060> except<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> only<00:01:07.260> downfall<00:01:07.500> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
spacious except that the only downfall I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.020 
spacious except that the only downfall I
think<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> bottom<00:01:08.610> part<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think is that the bottom part is a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
think is that the bottom part is a
little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.360> smaller<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:10.110> all

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
little bit smaller because there's all

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
little bit smaller because there's all
this<00:01:10.470> room<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.100> yeah<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this room here yeah it kind of just

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
this room here yeah it kind of just
stopped<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> blank

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
stopped and there's like kind of blank

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
stopped and there's like kind of blank
space<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> bottom<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> can't

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
space at the bottom of that you can't

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
space at the bottom of that you can't
fill<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.470> besides<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> luggage<00:01:17.610> is

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
is black and not pink so of course you

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.460 
is black and not pink so of course you
need<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.150> take<00:03:07.299> photos<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:07.900> travels<00:03:08.319> and

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
what's really cool is the lens here kind

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.449

of<00:03:10.420> twist<00:03:11.170> as<00:03:11.410> well<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.980> that's<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.250> really

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
of twist as well so that's a really

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.909 
of twist as well so that's a really
great<00:03:13.269> feature<00:03:13.569> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.049> hear<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.319> it<00:03:14.590> is

great feature if you can hear that it is

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.710 
great feature if you can hear that it is
pink<00:03:15.250> as<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.519> mentioned<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.000> has<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> strap<00:03:16.510> so

it can hang around your dolls next
what's<00:03:18.790> even<00:03:19.269> more<00:03:19.569> spectacular<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
what's even more spectacular is that it

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.409 
what's even more spectacular is that it
has<00:03:20.919> a<00:03:20.950> viewer<00:03:21.310> lines<00:03:21.519> but<00:03:21.760> as<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.239> see

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
has a viewer lines but as you can see

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.240 
has a viewer lines but as you can see
here<00:03:22.870> there's<00:03:23.139> a<00:03:23.230> picture<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.769> doll<00:03:23.980> with

generation doll this is our generation
set<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.750> think<00:03:29.079> we<00:03:29.169> really<00:03:29.380> found<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:29.739> you

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
set but I think we really found if you

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.349 
set but I think we really found if you
printed<00:03:30.160> off<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.250> picture<00:03:30.579> of<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:30.849> dolls<00:03:31.090> in

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
there and stuck it on there because I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.460 
there and stuck it on there because I
just<00:03:33.430> love<00:03:33.700> how<00:03:33.910> realistic<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.019> except

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
just love how realistic that is except

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.080 
just love how realistic that is except
is<00:03:35.709> probably<00:03:36.190> one<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.340> my<00:03:36.459> favorite<00:03:36.819> parts<00:03:37.030> of

is probably one of my favorite parts of
this<00:03:37.239> set<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:38.109> cat<00:03:38.349> neck<00:03:38.680> pillow<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.280> if

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
this set is this cat neck pillow and if

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.379 
this set is this cat neck pillow and if
you<00:03:39.459> know<00:03:39.609> when<00:03:39.790> you're<00:03:39.910> on<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> airplane

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
you know when you're on the airplane

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.569 
you know when you're on the airplane
your<00:03:40.780> neck<00:03:40.989> can<00:03:41.260> get<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> little<00:03:41.709> sore

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
your neck can get a little sore

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.460 
your neck can get a little sore
especially<00:03:43.329> if<00:03:43.450> you're<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> long<00:03:43.870> flight<00:03:44.139> so

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
especially if you're on a long flight so

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.170 
especially if you're on a long flight so
it<00:03:44.859> goes<00:03:45.010> on<00:03:45.190> your<00:03:45.310> dolls<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.700> act<00:03:45.819> while<00:03:46.030> they

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
it goes on your dolls and act while they

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.750 
it goes on your dolls and act while they
are<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.480> flight<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.349> is<00:03:47.410> so<00:03:47.739> squishy<00:03:48.099> then

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
are in flight and it is so squishy then

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.370 
are in flight and it is so squishy then
I<00:03:48.849> guess<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.239> with<00:03:49.419> the<00:03:49.540> cat<00:03:49.750> theme<00:03:49.989> here<00:03:50.230> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
I guess going with the cat theme here is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.400 
I guess going with the cat theme here is
a<00:03:50.410> little<00:03:50.590> luggage<00:03:51.130> tag<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:52.239> adorable<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900
