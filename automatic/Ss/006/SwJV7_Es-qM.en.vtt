00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.110 
a.m. I guess that's their clique name I
should<00:06:21.680> probably<00:06:21.800> lower<00:06:22.220> down<00:06:22.460> but<00:06:22.730> I<00:06:22.910> was

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
should probably lower down but I was

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.970 
should probably lower down but I was
like<00:06:23.330> I'll<00:06:23.690> know<00:06:24.260> their<00:06:24.440> names<00:06:24.620> here<00:06:24.860> in<00:06:24.920> a

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
like I'll know their names here in a

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.030 
like I'll know their names here in a
minute<00:06:26.290> but<00:06:27.290> I<00:06:27.320> think<00:06:27.650> they're<00:06:27.830> probably

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
minute but I think they're probably

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.970 
minute but I think they're probably
going<00:06:28.250> after<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.700> treasures<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.800> think<00:06:30.800> that's

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
going after the treasures I think that's

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.860 
going after the treasures I think that's
what<00:06:31.100> they're<00:06:31.250> doing<00:06:31.780> but

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.540 

pretty<00:06:36.870> but<00:06:37.080> this<00:06:37.320> is<00:06:37.590> just<00:06:40.100> the<00:06:41.100> introduction

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
pretty but this is just the introduction

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.900 
pretty but this is just the introduction
episode<00:06:41.850> um<00:06:43.190> but<00:06:44.190> it<00:06:44.280> was<00:06:44.370> still<00:06:44.520> really<00:06:44.669> good

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
episode um but it was still really good

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.010 
episode um but it was still really good
it's<00:06:45.180> set<00:06:45.330> up<00:06:45.360> for<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.660> good<00:06:45.840> story<00:06:47.900> pretty<00:06:48.900> much

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
it's set up for a good story pretty much

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.110 
it's set up for a good story pretty much
I<00:06:49.410> think<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:50.250> story<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.639> going<00:06:50.790> to<00:06:50.850> be<00:06:50.910> wrong

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
I think the story is going to be wrong

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.580 
I think the story is going to be wrong
around<00:06:51.419> June<00:06:51.630> though<00:06:52.669> trying<00:06:53.669> to<00:06:53.970> find<00:06:54.590> the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
around June though trying to find the

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.620 
around June though trying to find the
treasures<00:06:56.070> to<00:06:56.220> help<00:06:56.430> build<00:06:56.699> this<00:06:56.880> island<00:06:57.449> or

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
treasures to help build this island or

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.080 
treasures to help build this island or
build<00:06:57.690> this<00:06:58.229> place<00:06:58.590> where<00:06:58.919> that<00:06:59.639> nun<00:06:59.880> and<00:07:00.000> I

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
build this place where that nun and I

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.250 
build this place where that nun and I
wanted<00:07:00.479> it<00:07:00.540> and<00:07:00.690> then<00:07:00.780> to<00:07:01.080> help<00:07:01.290> her<00:07:01.440> move<00:07:01.620> on<00:07:01.830> I

wanted it and then to help her move on I

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.180 
wanted it and then to help her move on I
think<00:07:04.260> that's<00:07:04.410> what<00:07:04.560> it's<00:07:04.680> gonna<00:07:04.770> kind<00:07:05.010> of<00:07:05.070> be

think that's what it's gonna kind of be

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.020 
think that's what it's gonna kind of be
