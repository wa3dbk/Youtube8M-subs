00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.820
 Pure please a small village in the 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.250
 Gemeinde Wegscheid in Lower Bavaria 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 here stefan jacobs runs one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 agricultural operation after 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.070
 ecological guidelines a bio 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 refers 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.370
 this includes animal husbandry with 40 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.790
 children only for the 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.030
 be kept meat production 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.220
 This is currently seven hectares 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.290
 but then a second meadow with 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 about seven hectares where we switch 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.350
 can and are out year-round 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 You can go outside but there is one too 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 Pure at any time, the pure and pure 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 From the beginning on, jacobs was on the scene 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 blouse worked after his education 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.540
 he's on organic farms and what I do 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.550
 painful that he does not 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.670
 would like to lead conventional farmers 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 I thought of myself as a very young one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 I already cared for him 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.030
 All those specialized books were read at that time 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.880
 and that was then I have to say too 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.729
 just what something fascinating that what 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.370
 completely new but it is professional 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.680
 if I may say so 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.670
 just one 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.240
 I have to say a bigger one 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.400
 challenge me to my job 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.310
 as a little conventional agriculture 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.110
 would run a look in the stone 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.909
 shows that it is also clear here 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.250
 different from the conventional one 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.990
 Cattle farming gives the animals have here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.799
 not only much more lying surface 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 as in a fattening farm we have here 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.409
 a low 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.299
 that means it is always on it 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.680
 we have about one scattered now 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.050
 meter measures and then comes electricity and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.649
 so they have a nice soft warm 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.899
 Living area in the yard also and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.030
 100 chickens in summer and in winter 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.130
 enjoy the protection of fruit trees 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.440
 their lives live in the great outdoors 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.090
 Chickens have a spout of almost 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.840
 a hectare that goes down to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.220
 pond and we have chicken house for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.569
 laying eggs are outside all day long 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.459
 only at night we have to lock such a 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.330
 because of fox jacobs does more than 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 logical 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 he may the subject of the quality seal 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.150
 use that through the stronger ones 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.920
 guidelines an even better one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 animal husbandry and higher quality 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.630
 the tenant is guaranteed 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.180
 International organic brand and one of the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.190
 first of its kind in the label boom stands 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.049
 steffen jacobs, however, very skeptical 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.600
 across from 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.150
 save that every little bandage in 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.570
 every district city, so to speak 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.250
 own association establishes and and that it 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.890
 then again that only leads to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.000
 confusion and is the thing with 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.000
 safety not conducive 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.880
 the pigs also benefit from the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.280
 demeter guidelines currently 14 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.400
 Pigs feel both in the yard 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.260
 we have now built an outlet here 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.710
 for the pigs out at any time 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.570
 can 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.980
 why we have no reason because that 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.990
 the circulation is so high now 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.220
 and so hard to fulfill 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.130
 the pigs stay on average 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.410
 four to five months on the biohof in the 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.030
 year are fattened to 60 pigs and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.710
 at a regional organic butcher 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.590
 slaughtered the sales takes over 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.930
 Jacobs himself drives every Saturday 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.130
 to munich to a bio marktes one 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.100
 has a solid customer base 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.860
 Nevertheless, it is not always easy 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.830
 not easy to calculate that you have to 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.310
 say it is very difficult 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.360
 to cope financially 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.190
 but because we are in Munich 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.990
 really an interested clientele 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 and people who eat and eat 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.560
 drink really interested in it 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.270
 also willing to spend money 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.880
 we come with this form of 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.880
 landscape to luck to right 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.430
 an example of the difference 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.950
 between conventional bio and the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.660
 Tenant is the goat keeping jacobs is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.830
 the conviction that the goats are theirs 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.960
 keep horns 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.970
 that could be a danger for the 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.910
 But Melker raises the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.940
 quality of life of the animals and according to Jacob 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.250
 also the taste of the milk 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:17.720
 Customers value the British well 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:21.230
 for him, the acceptance will be in 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.870
 of course, the population also does me 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.790
 fun that people are there that 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.100
 I appreciate the saying that I want 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.780
 I want to buy for that 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.140
 I make money that's what my job is for me 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.490
 simply beautiful 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.590
 even if it probably always consumers 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.490
 will give about food only on the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.530
 pay attention 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.170
 We will have to see the future 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.980
 that this form of animal husbandry is the 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.980
 only human 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.639
 a
