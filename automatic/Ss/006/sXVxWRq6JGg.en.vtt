meant<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.610> used<00:01:32.820> initially<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> Call

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
meant to be used initially in the Call

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.149 
meant to be used initially in the Call
of<00:01:33.570> Duty<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.930> Treyarch<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.890> his

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
of Duty and Treyarch was actually on his

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
of Duty and Treyarch was actually on his
side<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.670> um<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.750> talked<00:01:36.960> about<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.229> world

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
side like um they talked about in world

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.630 
side like um they talked about in world
at<00:01:37.530> war<00:01:37.650> how<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> shouldn't<00:01:38.400> be<00:01:38.460> able<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
at war how you shouldn't be able to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.080 
at war how you shouldn't be able to
quickscope

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
quickscope

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
quickscope
I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.780> was<00:01:39.869> his<00:01:39.930> name<00:01:40.049> josh<00:01:40.290> olin<00:01:40.500> JD<00:01:40.920> 2020

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I think was his name josh olin JD 2020

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830 
I think was his name josh olin JD 2020
was<00:01:41.610> community<00:01:41.939> manager<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> time<00:01:42.479> he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
was community manager at that time he

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
was community manager at that time he
talked<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:44.250> why<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.790> black

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
talked about it and that's why in black

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.210 
talked about it and that's why in black
ops<00:01:45.329> 1<00:01:45.600> sniping<00:01:46.229> was<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.770> Newark<00:01:47.040> because

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
ops 1 sniping was like so Newark because

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
ops 1 sniping was like so Newark because
Treyarch<00:01:47.700> themselves<00:01:48.210> believe<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> other

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
Treyarch themselves believe the other

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.770 
Treyarch themselves believe the other
quickscoping<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.130> kind<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
quickscoping is just this kind of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.550 
quickscoping is just this kind of
overpowered<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.869> honestly<00:01:52.140> call<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> an

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
overpowered they honestly call it an

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.530 
overpowered they honestly call it an
exploit<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> game<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.970> obviously

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
exploit in the game and then obviously

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
exploit in the game and then obviously
here<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.200> black<00:01:55.530> ops<00:01:55.740> 2<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.159> bit

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
here in black ops 2 it's a little bit

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.499 
here in black ops 2 it's a little bit
easier<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> quickscope<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.329> did

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
easier to quickscope I think they did

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
easier to quickscope I think they did
that<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> appease<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> snipers<00:01:59.250> because

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
that just to appease the snipers because

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.800 
that just to appease the snipers because
so<00:01:59.610> many<00:01:59.700> people<00:02:00.090> were<00:02:00.180> upset<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.659> frustrated

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so many people were upset and frustrated

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
so many people were upset and frustrated
with<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.350> difficult<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
with how difficult it was to kind of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.560 
with how difficult it was to kind of
like<00:02:02.490> quick<00:02:02.579> scope<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> black<00:02:03.180> ops<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
like quick scope and black ops and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
like quick scope and black ops and
whatnot<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.469> made<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> little<00:02:04.860> bit<00:02:04.950> easier<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
whatnot I say made a little bit easier I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.469 
whatnot I say made a little bit easier I
don't<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.880> easy<00:02:06.000> as<00:02:06.180> modern

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
don't think it's as easy as modern

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.670 
don't think it's as easy as modern
warfare<00:02:06.600> 2<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.110> think<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.380> easy<00:02:07.500> as

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
warfare 2 I don't think it's as easy as

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550 
warfare 2 I don't think it's as easy as
modern<00:02:08.399> warfare<00:02:08.550> 3<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.599> essentially<00:02:10.289> it's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
modern warfare 3 but essentially it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.390 
modern warfare 3 but essentially it's
it's<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> bit

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's a bit

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.240 
it's a bit
here<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.870> kind<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.140> follows<00:02:13.709> back<00:02:13.920> into

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
here now this kind of follows back into

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.740 
here now this kind of follows back into

the video I posted yesterday the video I
posted<00:02:16.049> yesterday<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.409> was<00:02:16.560> talking<00:02:16.829> about<00:02:16.860> DLC

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
posted yesterday I was talking about DLC

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.250 
posted yesterday I was talking about DLC
maps<00:02:17.670> when<00:02:18.329> they're<00:02:18.510> coming<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.019> what<00:02:19.230> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
maps when they're coming out and what I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.259 
maps when they're coming out and what I
hope<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.769> see<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.189> out<00:02:20.280> these<00:02:20.459> DLC<00:02:20.849> maps<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
hope to see for out these DLC maps I

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.910 
hope to see for out these DLC maps I
basically<00:02:21.989> discussed<00:02:22.319> how<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.439> would<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.799> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
basically discussed how I would like to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.949 
basically discussed how I would like to
see<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.099> bigger<00:02:23.790> variety<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.390> maps<00:02:24.720> now

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
see a bigger variety of maps now

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.360 
see a bigger variety of maps now
obviously<00:02:25.290> there's<00:02:25.470> tons<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.769> variety<00:02:25.980> in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
obviously there's tons of variety in

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.949 
obviously there's tons of variety in
terms<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.879> map<00:02:27.030> locations<00:02:27.569> here<00:02:27.780> we're<00:02:27.900> on

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
terms of the map locations here we're on

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.599 
terms of the map locations here we're on
carrier<00:02:28.349> we're<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> USS<00:02:29.010> Obama<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.549> the

carrier we're on the USS Obama in the

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.699 
carrier we're on the USS Obama in the
middle<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.849> ocean<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.989> got<00:02:31.109> Yemen<00:02:31.470> over

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
middle the ocean you got Yemen over

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.099 
middle the ocean you got Yemen over
there<00:02:31.859> in<00:02:31.950> Yemen<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.430> got<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:33.750> trying<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.049> you

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
there in Yemen you got I'm trying to you

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.020 
there in Yemen you got I'm trying to you
got<00:02:34.319> Plaza<00:02:34.590> which<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.159> like<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.549> this<00:02:35.730> resort

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
got Plaza which is like at this resort

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.509 
got Plaza which is like at this resort
in<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.480> ocean<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.989> got<00:02:37.079> slums<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.400> all

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
in the ocean you got slums you have all

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.920 
in the ocean you got slums you have all
these<00:02:38.609> different<00:02:38.730> places<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.689> maps

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
these different places but the maps

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.599 
these different places but the maps
themselves<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.980> lean<00:02:41.280> towards

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
themselves they kind of lean towards

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.190 
themselves they kind of lean towards
this<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:41.849> play<00:02:42.090> style<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.659> play<00:02:42.870> style

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
this one play style this one play style

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.020 
this one play style this one play style
of<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.470> rush<00:02:43.709> heavy<00:02:43.980> submachine<00:02:44.609> gun<00:02:44.790> style

of a rush heavy submachine gun style

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.229 
of a rush heavy submachine gun style
where<00:02:45.870> everything<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.739> close-quarter<00:02:47.639> tight

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
where everything is close-quarter tight

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.449 
where everything is close-quarter tight
alleys<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.379> constant<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:50.010> close

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
alleys and just constant you know close

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.369 
alleys and just constant you know close
quarters<00:02:50.760> combat<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.629> how<00:02:51.780> I'd<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.139> see

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
quarters combat and how I'd like to see

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.199 
quarters combat and how I'd like to see
a<00:02:52.409> different<00:02:52.739> variety<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.150> the

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
are always going over there and so I

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.990 
are always going over there and so I
would<00:04:13.949> like<00:04:14.040> pick<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.220> spot<00:04:14.519> where<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.790> could

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
would like pick a spot where I could

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.670 
would like pick a spot where I could
like<00:04:15.120> basically<00:04:15.569> focus<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.139> entire<00:04:16.229> game<00:04:16.530> on

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
like basically focus the entire game on

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.589 
like basically focus the entire game on
taking<00:04:16.979> those<00:04:17.130> people<00:04:17.489> off<00:04:17.699> of<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:18.389> balcony

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
taking those people off of that balcony

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.089 
taking those people off of that balcony
and<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:19.229> why<00:04:19.349> we<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.590> more<00:04:19.859> for<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
and that's why we do it more for to a

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.709 
and that's why we do it more for to a
new<00:04:20.279> scout<00:04:20.700> site<00:04:20.940> being<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.180> so<00:04:21.299> much<00:04:21.419> fun<00:04:21.570> it's

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
new scout site being is so much fun it's

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.330
