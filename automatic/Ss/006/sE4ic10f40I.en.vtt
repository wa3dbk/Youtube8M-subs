00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi to all dear android children 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.020
 they are masters for the quality channel 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.790
 Italian and welcome to my new one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.030
 column dedicated to the world of android 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.259
 in this new section I will explain 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.220
 lots of things between guides and tutorials 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.920
 various tweaks to enhance and optimize 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.850
 your phone or android device 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.439
 as you prefer at most and in this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.330
 beautiful video I will explain what the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 rock 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.050
 the video will be divided into five parts 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.550
 and a first part begins where now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.750
 I will explain to you what the root is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 nothing more than a release procedure 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.700
 for your phone to the device 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.410
 tablet device with course for here 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.850
 resting android 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 the mountain does not allow very simple 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.570
 that you can do on most devices with 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.520
 over android because the devices 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 when they leave the factory he would come 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 to the side usually like a version of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.629
 modified software taken on the base 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 open source lake why android is a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.739
 both open source operating system 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.040
 free source so everyone can 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.810
 get your hands then samsung lg them 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 make the changes and then leave 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.369
 original software after it was 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.360
 released the original software 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.650
 will arrive on your type phone with a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.250
 samsung galaxy s3 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.140
 you have the samsung software with 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 their various modifications and with theirs 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 various blocks then doing he will be able to 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.530
 unlock all the features of the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.659
 your phone so you can change 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.360
 version of android to be able to modify 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.180
 the rom make various changes to work on 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.939
 on hardware resources 15 plus work 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.189
 on the ram modify that of 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.840
 ram and much more in broken facts 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.299
 dangerous if you don't know where to go to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.920
 get your hands and broken one of the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.720
 procedures is one of the most procedures 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 easy to do on most 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 phones thanks to many tools put 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.939
 available from experts on the network on 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.920
 major reference forum is xda is a 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.619
 funds developers android experts e 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.509
 but we certainly do n't have any people either 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.099
 really good that creates roms creates various 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.509
 kernell etc. and that will help you in vi 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.190
 help you create to burp place 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960
 phone in case you would like yours 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.130
 clothes 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.400
 device you ca n't find 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.440
 lots of compatibility devices 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.330
 for devices therefore type for i 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.520
 samsung galaxy already there are many 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930
 then distinguish even if the LG are 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.050
 many lewitts and for the nexus that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.060
 they are phones created by lg but from 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.520
 but in reality they would be bullock 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 person assembled from lg 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.490
 then ok, there are many set up on 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.580
 You can find all the kids on the web 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.070
 just write ruth boxwood phone from 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.810
 fine guide is a very simple thing 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.320
 just be careful they guessed it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.210
 nothing and for this first part is over 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.400
 the router this and now I will reveal the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.980
 meaning of the term broken into 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.290
 Italian means root or ruth not 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.450
 is nothing but the primary type partition 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.610
 we can say the primary partition not 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.650
 it is said that the most powerful user up 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.650
 to use it is urgent more powerful in a 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.280
 system unix system then linux 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.790
 Android 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.860
 all unix based systems since 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.510
 ruth can be unlocked with various 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.630
 procedures once unlocked to 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.460
 super user that is none other than it is 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.360
 an application if you still have the rom 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.520
 original 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.620
 always remember it is the software from 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.490
 installed or in case you have a 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.980
 taste 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.670
 like the cyanogenmod which is one of the Roma 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.660
 best lighter and faster than 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.340
 all 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.780
 trust me I recommend it up to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.070
 exhaustion from the councilor until 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.240
 exhaustion 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.250
 thanks to those I have made us reborn 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.930
 a lg optimus and therapies a telephone 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.080
 very low end thanks to the break 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.840
 remember it well is practically with 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.760
 that air you can have the super user 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.130
 already integrated but because you have unlocked 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.630
 the bootloader unblocked the recovery mode 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.250
 which is a modality that will allow him to 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.480
 access various functions such as playing 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.250
 high roms 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.900
 so other software well remember me 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.730
 I always repeat it because this guide is 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.500
 also made for neophytes therefore people 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.720
 new in the world that is not Android 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.940
 still approached the rum from those things 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.880
 there for fear of blocking phones 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.620
 etc. and boys meanings from this 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.890
 the end of systems like in linux is already 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.000
 integrated superuser just set it 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.470
 instead in android it is a tough must 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.880
 unlock is imposed because of the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.480
 developers this true limit does not 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.970
 risk doing 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.470
 ruin the phone now but all 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.830
 pros and cons 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.980
 the root guys the pro of the utc are 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.440
 really many and outstretched are really 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.710
 many and I have to stop doing like marco 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.480
 marine no oh well if the pros of the utc are 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.310
 really many because you will have 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.460
 possibility of empowering I do not say 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.520
 power up no final cite mentions it 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.860
 the more you can type or 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.660
 act higher than ram to do various 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.920
 change the wheels applications 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.870
 guys and I'm sorry to say it wasn't 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.760
 also for the purpose of prevention 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.160
 but this part I never could 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.390
 explain why unfortunately it is a su 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.490
 youtube youtube and I do not I can 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.650
 explain but you will find many ones 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.750
 on the net, guys, so I'm not there 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.360
 not even to explain elos then to 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.220
 advantage of having more modification of the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.530
 operating system of your phone 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.570
 with android type you can modify the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.370
 LED brightness and much more 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.620
 you can do a lot of things for the root 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.020
 but if you don't know where to put your hands 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.910
 the boys don't do it please don't 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.740
 ruin and then do not fight crying from me 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.240
 because I was everything I will not explain 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.740
 how do you do it because every phone has one 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.840
 different procedure and therefore not there 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.720
 I'll explain why it wouldn't be too much 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.240
 complicated for me it is then I can not 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.830
 I don't have 10 thousand euros to buy me 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.970
 every phone to make you each guide 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.080
 of the procedure 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.670
 at most I can make the skin s3 ok 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.610
 so look at the good one in route 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:48.770
 many promos also some against 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.940
 but some terrible cons without 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.160
 problems 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.100
 guys the only flaw of the root and yes 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.140
 it loses its guarantee but says nothing 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.040
 don't say anything I didn't tell you that 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.200
 warranty can be resumed 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.810
 simply by resetting the phone 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.410
 to the official Roma so there is no 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.720
 worry 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.190
 here are the types de easily then I will teach 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.350
 for each type of phone at least for 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.640
 read and for samsung as returning rom 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.190
 original of course I won't 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.110
 because otherwise it is a scary thing to have 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.460
 every time of cristina of all the cyan 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.320
 it's a mess I'll just show you 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.760
 part of the PCI in the part for the 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.830
 cell phone for the appearance of the item 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.840
 therefore the only disadvantage to that but e 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.610
 easily usable 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.330
 so I strongly recommend you for mistakes 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.120
 and see you in the conclusions 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.920
 in conclusion boys and ruth excellent 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.210
 method to upgrade your phone 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.610
 of home that you already have a powerful one for 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.780
 make it even more powerful once 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.360
 in the c most of its power 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.250
 to hold the GPU to upgrade the card 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.900
 phone video or home you want 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.150
 old newspaper phones your own 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.970
 telephone type as a fact of gl 3 an 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.190
 time or keep the GPU at maximum 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.010
 even there obviously it will be consumed more 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.970
 easily because on old phones 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:01.010
 bonanno powerful processors then 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.710
 I strongly recommend you ruth vi 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.080
 I especially recommend doing it by 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.700
 change rom try it a little all heads 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.310
 rumble all functions obviously in the 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.500
 limit being careful before making a 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.150
 what to do one thing a lot 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.520
 careful indeed sent a message 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.720
 private to the canal or send it 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.580
 directly on my channel like 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.620
 favorite I will be very happy to help 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.750
 that or in case of tutorial on 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.120
 android I also am very happy with 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.770
 make real and I can do without problems 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.950
 so much thanks to route the possibility of 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.390
 then record in these here in the event 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.890
 of need write write to us
