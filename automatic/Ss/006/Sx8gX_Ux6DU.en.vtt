00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
an expansion attempt to the north and a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.439 
an expansion attempt to the north and a
rune<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.250> humans<00:00:20.609> still<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> mix<00:00:21.119> that's<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
rune of humans still in the mix that's a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.090 
rune of humans still in the mix that's a
little<00:00:21.660> bit<00:00:21.779> odd<00:00:21.900> we're<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.590> healing<00:00:22.800> still

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
little bit odd we're not healing still

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.140 
little bit odd we're not healing still
in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> mix<00:00:23.369> tree<00:00:23.550> mind<00:00:23.760> getting<00:00:24.060> an

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
in the mix tree mind getting an

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
in the mix tree mind getting an
expansion<00:00:24.600> over<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> north<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
expansion over here to the north and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.429 
expansion over here to the north and
creeping<00:00:26.670> out<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> south<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.449> well<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.869> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
creeping out the south as well so we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.220 
creeping out the south as well so we
have<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> cloak<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.039> emulation<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.230> notable

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
have a cloak of emulation on the notable

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.690 
have a cloak of emulation on the notable
item<00:00:31.410> drops<00:00:31.619> cloak<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.920> emulation<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
item drops cloak of emulation on the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.680 
item drops cloak of emulation on the
demon<00:00:32.969> hunter<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
demon hunter and I think there's a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.040 
demon hunter and I think there's a
jingle<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.410> on<00:00:35.030> ya<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> Shadowhunter<00:00:36.899> so

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
jingle or on ya on the Shadowhunter so

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.959 
jingle or on ya on the Shadowhunter so
it<00:00:37.260> does<00:00:37.559> give<00:00:37.710> endurance<00:00:38.100> orders<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it does give endurance orders or so that

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.970 
it does give endurance orders or so that
should<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.270> interesting<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.809> well<00:00:39.989> increased

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
should be interesting as well increased

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
should be interesting as well increased
movement<00:00:41.129> speed<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.790> increase<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> tax<00:00:42.719> rate

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
movement speed and increase a tax rate

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
movement speed and increase a tax rate
so<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.190> ahead<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.640> game

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so let's go ahead and get this game

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
so let's go ahead and get this game
underway<00:00:45.680> additional<00:00:46.680> creepy<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.129> coming<00:00:47.430> in
