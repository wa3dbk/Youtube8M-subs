00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
let's say probably around a four to six

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
let's say probably around a four to six

distillers that's the type of head that
they<00:01:25.950> would<00:01:26.100> use<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.270> copper<00:01:27.960> still<00:01:28.200> can

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
they would use so this copper still can

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
they would use so this copper still can
actually<00:01:29.430> produce<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> different

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
actually produce a lot of different

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810 
actually produce a lot of different
styles<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> spirits<00:01:31.680> putting<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.579> same

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820

spirit with different heads on and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.600 
spirit with different heads on and
temperatures<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> run<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> tap<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.400> actually

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
temperatures I run a tap will actually

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
temperatures I run a tap will actually
produce<00:01:35.729> different<00:01:36.150> flavors<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.380> you've

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
produce different flavors then if you've

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.660 
produce different flavors then if you've
seen<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> background<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> small

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
to eight years for let's say a whiskey

to eight years for let's say a whiskey
to<00:01:53.820> age<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.259> greatest

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
to age but because of the greatest

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.459 
to age but because of the greatest
surface<00:01:55.860> area<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> smaller<00:01:57.060> barrel<00:01:57.479> that

surface area in a smaller barrel that

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
surface area in a smaller barrel that
you<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> same<00:01:59.430> amount<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.700> Aging<00:02:00.090> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you can get the same amount of Aging in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.520 
you can get the same amount of Aging in
about<00:02:00.390> four<00:02:00.659> months<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> five<00:02:01.320> gallon

about four months in a five gallon

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.200 
about four months in a five gallon
barrel<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.070> even<00:02:02.280> less<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.729> one<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> small
