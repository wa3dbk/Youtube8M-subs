00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.609 
late-game build for mag so money of you
know<00:00:19.950> we<00:00:20.220> already<00:00:20.610> have<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.270> mag<00:00:22.140> build<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.590> our

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
know we already have a mag build on our

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.589 
know we already have a mag build on our
channel<00:00:23.099> but<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.669> dated<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.480> the

channel but it's very dated it's the

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.150 
channel but it's very dated it's the
little<00:00:24.840> warframe<00:00:25.169> powers<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.829> and<00:00:25.950> stuff

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
little warframe powers in it and stuff

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.310 
little warframe powers in it and stuff
so<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:26.970> bringing<00:00:27.360> you<00:00:27.509> something<00:00:27.989> that's<00:00:28.200> a

little more recent Oh
papac's<00:00:31.140> inbound<00:00:31.619> great<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.290> basically<00:00:34.309> back

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
papac's inbound great so basically back

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
papac's inbound great so basically back
in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> day<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.790> couldn't<00:00:35.940> run<00:00:36.120> transient<00:00:36.600> for

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in the day we couldn't run transient for

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
in the day we couldn't run transient for
attitude<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:38.090> by<00:00:39.090> running<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.600> we're<00:00:39.809> able

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
attitude so by running that we're able

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.419 
attitude so by running that we're able
to<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.289> away<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.649> running<00:00:41.010> things<00:00:41.219> like

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
to get away with running things like

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.479 
to get away with running things like
overextended<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.739> we're<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:43.890> able<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> get

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
overextended and we're also able to get

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
overextended and we're also able to get
towards<00:00:44.879> efficiency<00:00:45.000> cap<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.199> there's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
towards efficiency cap so there's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.599 
towards efficiency cap so there's
actually<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.649> different<00:00:46.890> builds<00:00:47.339> that<00:00:47.519> you

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
actually two different builds that you

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.130 
actually two different builds that you
can<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.059> with<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.359> and<00:00:48.600> I'll<00:00:48.719> show<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.929> both

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
can do with this and I'll show you both

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
can do with this and I'll show you both
of<00:00:49.199> them<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.339> first<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.969> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
of them this is the first one and this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.229 
of them this is the first one and this
one<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.749> mainly<00:00:52.109> based<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.980> gaining<00:00:53.850> more

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
one is mainly based on gaining more

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.220 
one is mainly based on gaining more
range<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.039> expense<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.730> efficiency<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
range at the expense of efficiency so

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
range at the expense of efficiency so
the<00:00:58.649> magic<00:00:58.980> number<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.249> strength<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> want<00:00:59.850> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the magic number of strength you want to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
the magic number of strength you want to
get<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.179> 200%<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.679> anything<00:01:01.949> over<00:01:02.039> that's<00:01:02.339> fine

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
get is 200% so anything over that's fine

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
get is 200% so anything over that's fine
don't<00:01:03.120> go<00:01:03.269> too<00:01:03.329> far<00:01:03.719> over<00:01:03.929> it<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.230> then

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
don't go too far over it because then

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
don't go too far over it because then
you're<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.680> really<00:01:05.180> maximizing<00:01:06.180> your

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
you're not really maximizing your

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.480 
you're not really maximizing your
potential<00:01:06.800> but<00:01:07.800> as<00:01:07.980> long<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.430> two

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
potential but as long as you have two

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.740 
potential but as long as you have two
hundred<00:01:08.610> percent<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.120> will<00:01:09.180> strip<00:01:09.510> their

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
hundred percent it will strip their

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530 
hundred percent it will strip their
shields<00:01:10.200> fully<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:12.000> other<00:01:12.149> thing<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
shields fully the other thing is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
shields fully the other thing is
obviously<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.590> max<00:01:13.890> fleeting

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
obviously you want to have max fleeting

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.060 
obviously you want to have max fleeting
max<00:01:14.759> streamline<00:01:15.380> max<00:01:16.380> transient<00:01:16.740> for<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
max streamline max transient for two to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.260 
max streamline max transient for two to
two<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:19.259> mag<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.549> duration<00:01:21.090> doesn't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
two because in mag the duration doesn't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.850 
two because in mag the duration doesn't
really<00:01:21.659> matter<00:01:21.960> at<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:24.079> so<00:01:25.079> basically<00:01:25.469> you're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
really matter at all so basically you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.459 
really matter at all so basically you're
able<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.219> max<00:01:26.430> these<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> then

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
able to the max these two here and then

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.580 
able to the max these two here and then
blind<00:01:28.829> rage<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.630> it's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.750> rank<00:01:30.960> seven<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
blind rage is it's a rank seven for this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.709 
blind rage is it's a rank seven for this
build<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.700> other<00:01:32.850> build<00:01:33.149> you're<00:01:33.630> gonna

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
build in the other build you're gonna

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.950 
build in the other build you're gonna
put<00:01:33.960> stretch<00:01:34.259> here<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:36.090> rank<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.689> blind

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
put stretch here and a rank two blind

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
put stretch here and a rank two blind
rage<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:37.890> show<00:01:38.039> you<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.640> basically

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
rage and I'll show you that so basically

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
rage and I'll show you that so basically
the<00:01:39.600> difference<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:41.130> getting

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the difference is that you're getting

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
the difference is that you're getting
efficiency<00:01:41.939> cap<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> other<00:01:42.539> one<00:01:42.750> but

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
efficiency cap and the other one but

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
efficiency cap and the other one but
you're<00:01:43.409> losing<00:01:43.560> some<00:01:43.950> range<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:45.360> other<00:01:45.509> mod

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
you're losing some range the other mod

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.649 
you're losing some range the other mod
here<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.110> granny<00:01:46.350> pole<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.909> been<00:01:48.119> nerfed<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
here is granny pole it's been nerfed and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
here is granny pole it's been nerfed and
people<00:01:48.869> complain<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.289> it's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.430> great

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
people complain that it's not great

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
people complain that it's not great
after<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.479> nerf<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.409> it's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
after the nerf but I think it's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.109 
after the nerf but I think it's
fantastic<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:53.399> able<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> pull<00:01:53.939> life

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
fantastic you're able to pull life

has to leave the room if you're playing
correctly<00:01:58.289> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.979> long<00:01:59.310> without

the<00:02:10.020> Excellus<00:02:10.500> mod<00:02:10.950> slot<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:12.330> running<00:02:12.600> out<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
the Excellus mod slot I'm running out of

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.990 
the Excellus mod slot I'm running out of
me<00:02:12.810> sense<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:14.070> could<00:02:14.190> run<00:02:14.340> whatever<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.760> want

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
me sense you could run whatever you want

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.180 
me sense you could run whatever you want
obviously<00:02:15.570> it's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> utility<00:02:16.350> mod<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
obviously it's a utility mod I

obviously it's a utility mod I
enemy<00:02:17.460> sense<00:02:17.700> helps<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> most<00:02:18.600> because

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
enemy sense helps in the most because

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.420 
enemy sense helps in the most because
when<00:02:19.320> you're<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> room<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:20.220> what's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
when you're in a room you can see what's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.810 
when you're in a room you can see what's
outside<00:02:22.040> personally<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.100> would<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.670> run

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
outside personally I would like to run

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.790 
outside personally I would like to run
rusher<00:02:24.300> Maglev<00:02:24.750> maybe<00:02:24.990> but<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:25.680> don't

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
rusher Maglev maybe but I just don't

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
rusher Maglev maybe but I just don't
have<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.070> bond<00:02:26.250> slots<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.330> really

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
have the bond slots and I don't really

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.200 
have the bond slots and I don't really
care<00:02:27.750> either<00:02:27.780> way<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> anyway<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.180> other

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
care either way so anyway the other

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.130 
care either way so anyway the other
build<00:02:31.070> involves<00:02:32.120> stretch<00:02:33.290> being<00:02:34.790> yeah<00:02:35.900> I'm<00:02:36.900> on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
build involves stretch being yeah I'm on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.770 
build involves stretch being yeah I'm on
the<00:02:37.230> Excellus<00:02:37.740> thing<00:02:38.220> let's<00:02:38.790> try<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.540> oh

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the Excellus thing let's try that oh

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.510 
the Excellus thing let's try that oh
there<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.320> okay<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.010> we're<00:02:41.250> gonna<00:02:41.340> run

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
there it is okay so we're gonna run

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.890 
there it is okay so we're gonna run
stretch<00:02:41.790> there<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:42.990> for<00:02:43.380> blind<00:02:43.710> rage

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.449 

we're<00:02:47.739> gonna<00:02:47.830> run<00:02:48.129> a<00:02:48.400> rank<00:02:49.030> two<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
we're gonna run a rank two so the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.920 
we're gonna run a rank two so the
difference<00:02:51.819> here<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.300> can<00:02:52.480> see<00:02:52.629> on<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
difference here is you can see on this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.559 
difference here is you can see on this
left<00:02:53.200> side<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.459> narrow<00:02:54.760> deficiency<00:02:55.330> cap

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
left side is the narrow deficiency cap

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.500 
left side is the narrow deficiency cap
the<00:02:56.440> range<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.860> decreased<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:57.670> it's<00:02:58.000> down<00:02:58.239> to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
the range is decreased but it's down to

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.750 
the range is decreased but it's down to
what<00:02:58.780> it<00:02:58.870> was<00:02:59.080> before<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.280> worked<00:03:00.519> just

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
what it was before and that worked just

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.030 
what it was before and that worked just
fine<00:03:00.879> anyway<00:03:01.500> power<00:03:02.500> strength<00:03:02.739> changed

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
fine anyway power strength changed

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.670 
fine anyway power strength changed
slightly<00:03:03.190> 5%<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.360> big<00:03:04.540> deal<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:04.930> as<00:03:05.410> I

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
slightly 5% not a big deal because as I

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.640 
slightly 5% not a big deal because as I
said<00:03:05.739> before<00:03:06.010> as<00:03:06.610> long<00:03:07.209> as<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.599> are<00:03:07.959> above<00:03:08.470> two

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
said before as long as you are above two

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.570 
said before as long as you are above two
hundred<00:03:08.680> percent<00:03:08.920> you'd<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.489> worry

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
hundred percent you'd have to worry

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.130 
hundred percent you'd have to worry
about<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.879> now<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.569> other<00:03:10.750> thing<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.019> I'm

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
about that now the other thing is I'm

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.949 
about that now the other thing is I'm
running<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.940> know<00:03:13.030> arcane<00:03:13.420> helmet<00:03:13.780> over

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
running the you know arcane helmet over

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.960 
running the you know arcane helmet over
here<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.379> can<00:03:14.500> see<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.920> corner<00:03:15.160> this

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
here you can see that in the corner this

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.300 
here you can see that in the corner this
is<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> one<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.390> increases<00:03:16.810> range<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.410> would

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
is the one that increases range I would

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.990 
is the one that increases range I would
suggest<00:03:18.489> using<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.220> basically<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
suggest using that so basically the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.720 
suggest using that so basically the
difference<00:03:22.360> between<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.900> two<00:03:23.079> builds<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
difference between the two builds and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.080 
difference between the two builds and
why<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.510> should<00:03:25.840> choose<00:03:26.110> each<00:03:26.290> one<00:03:26.319> is

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
why you should choose each one is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
why you should choose each one is
dependent<00:03:28.090> upon<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.380> mission<00:03:29.860> type<00:03:30.099> in<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
dependent upon the mission type in the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.750 
dependent upon the mission type in the
pile<00:03:31.180> set<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.230> know<00:03:32.319> first<00:03:32.500> survival<00:03:33.129> may

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
pile set so you know first survival may

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.449 
pile set so you know first survival may
be<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.569> place<00:03:34.780> you're<00:03:34.930> playing<00:03:35.170> at<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.799> you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
be the place you're playing at is you

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.460 
be the place you're playing at is you
know<00:03:36.489> if<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.209> go<00:03:37.329> in<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.690> see<00:03:37.900> choose<00:03:38.290> which

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
know if you go in and see choose which

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.350 
know if you go in and see choose which
room<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.769> want<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:39.459> you<00:03:39.790> need<00:03:40.090> longer

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
room you want and it's you need longer

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.479 
room you want and it's you need longer
range<00:03:40.720> then<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.140> would<00:03:41.260> run<00:03:41.379> that<00:03:41.590> if<00:03:41.860> it's

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
range then you would run that if it's

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.390 
range then you would run that if it's
for<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:43.470> defense<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.769> know<00:03:44.860> maybe<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.160> want

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
for a defense you know maybe you want

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.839 
for a defense you know maybe you want
longer<00:03:45.700> range<00:03:45.879> for<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.760> know

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
longer range for that for you know

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.670 
longer range for that for you know
regular<00:03:49.120> survival<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.840> might<00:03:50.079> be<00:03:50.230> fine<00:03:50.470> with

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
regular survival you might be fine with

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
regular survival you might be fine with
running<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.130> stretch<00:03:51.519> that's<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.180> range

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
running a stretch that's this range

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.379 
running a stretch that's this range
that's<00:03:53.410> fine<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.060> way<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.299> get

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
that's fine and that way you get

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.699 
that's fine and that way you get
efficiency<00:03:55.810> cap<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.410> can<00:03:56.530> shield

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
efficiency cap so you can shield

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
the day and we did some testing that was

the day and we did some testing that was
successful<00:04:43.180> we<00:04:43.960> we<00:04:44.770> found<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.280> kind<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.610> an<00:04:45.729> ish
