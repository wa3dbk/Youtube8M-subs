fact right-click the the iron block I

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.310 
fact right-click the the iron block I
can<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.590> say<00:01:24.799> antenna<00:01:25.219> range<00:01:25.549> 50<00:01:26.060> meters<00:01:26.539> in

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
can I say antenna range 50 meters in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.959 
can I say antenna range 50 meters in
order<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:27.799> pick<00:01:27.979> up<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.280> signal<00:01:28.820> though

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
order to pick up the signal though

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.029 
order to pick up the signal though
that's<00:01:29.210> being<00:01:29.390> broadcast<00:01:29.749> from<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.560> antenna

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
that's being broadcast from that antenna

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.669 
that's being broadcast from that antenna
you<00:01:31.939> would<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.420> fact<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.049> set<00:01:33.319> up<00:01:33.409> another

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
you would in fact have to set up another

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.529 
you would in fact have to set up another
fixed<00:01:34.249> one<00:01:34.429> say<00:01:34.819> within<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.420> 50<00:01:35.869> meter

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
fixed one say within that 50 meter

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.719 
fixed one say within that 50 meter
broadcast<00:01:38.539> range<00:01:38.899> as<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.619> were<00:01:39.859> so<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:40.520> every

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
broadcast range as it were so so every

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.419 
broadcast range as it were so so every
way<00:01:40.850> went<00:01:41.030> over<00:01:41.179> here<00:01:41.530> yes<00:01:42.530> I<00:01:42.829> say<00:01:43.069> if<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.249> made

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
way went over here yes I say if you made

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.129 
way went over here yes I say if you made
one<00:01:43.460> over<00:01:43.909> here<00:01:45.189> what<00:01:46.189> what<00:01:46.640> tends<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.780> be<00:01:47.990> the

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
one over here what what tends to be the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:52.270 
one over here what what tends to be the
best<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:49.899> normally<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.049> put<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.229> red<00:01:51.469> red

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
best is normally if you put a red red

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.309 
best is normally if you put a red red
torch<00:01:52.609> down<00:01:52.880> first<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:53.749> do<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.079> way

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
torch down first and do it that way

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.919 
torch down first and do it that way
because<00:01:54.679> sometimes<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.880> glitches<00:01:56.450> out<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.630> bit

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
because sometimes it glitches out a bit

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.870 
because sometimes it glitches out a bit
and<00:01:57.079> don't<00:01:57.469> set<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.069> then<00:01:58.189> 10<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:58.520> don't<00:01:58.789> know

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
and don't set and then 10 I don't know

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.929 
and don't set and then 10 I don't know
they<00:01:59.210> go<00:01:59.299> into<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.630> creative<00:01:59.929> area<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.939> think

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
they go into the creative area I think

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.399 
they go into the creative area I think
then<00:02:02.090> when<00:02:02.329> you<00:02:02.450> right-click<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.959> tells<00:02:03.200> you

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
then when you right-click it tells you

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.179 
then when you right-click it tells you
on<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:05.030> message<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.899> tells<00:02:06.170> me<00:02:06.380> my<00:02:06.409> message

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
on the message it tells me my message

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.680 
on the message it tells me my message
from<00:02:07.340> over<00:02:07.609> here

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
from over here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
from over here
now<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:10.050> order<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.950> increase<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
now in order to actually increase that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.030 
now in order to actually increase that
range<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.750> actually<00:02:12.930> change<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.770> Kong

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
range you can actually change the Kong

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.270 
range you can actually change the Kong
config<00:02:14.819> file<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:16.110> choose<00:02:16.770> what<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> default

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
config file to choose what the default

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.390 
config file to choose what the default
is<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.480> broadcast<00:02:18.930> range<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:20.069> if<00:02:20.250> you

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
is for the broadcast range but if you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.720 
is for the broadcast range but if you
put<00:02:20.580> iron<00:02:20.970> bars<00:02:21.240> on<00:02:21.600> top<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.980> V<00:02:23.550> iron

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
put iron bars on top of the V iron

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.270 
put iron bars on top of the V iron
blocks<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.450> does<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.500> fact<00:02:25.830> increase

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
blocks it does actually in fact increase

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
blocks it does actually in fact increase
that<00:02:26.550> antenna<00:02:27.000> range<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.170> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.470> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
that antenna range as you can see it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.100 
that antenna range as you can see it
says<00:02:28.770> extended<00:02:29.340> antenna<00:02:29.489> range<00:02:29.940> 250<00:02:30.840> meters

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
says extended antenna range 250 meters

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.670 
says extended antenna range 250 meters
200<00:02:32.270> 250<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.510> I've<00:02:33.840> stopped<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> 300<00:02:34.590> cuz

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
200 250 and I've stopped a 300 cuz

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.710 
200 250 and I've stopped a 300 cuz
that's<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> bit<00:02:35.100> tool<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.940> every<00:02:36.510> iron

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that's going a bit tool so every iron

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.040 
that's going a bit tool so every iron
bar<00:02:36.959> extends<00:02:37.650> at<00:02:37.770> 50<00:02:38.100> meters<00:02:38.220> oh<00:02:38.780> yeah<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
bar extends at 50 meters oh yeah and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.590 
bar extends at 50 meters oh yeah and
once<00:02:40.260> again<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.519> changeable<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
once again that is changeable in the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.160 
once again that is changeable in the
config<00:02:43.050> file<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.340> could<00:02:44.690> today<00:02:45.690> over<00:02:45.989> there

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
config file so I could today over there

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.400 
config file so I could today over there
oh<00:02:46.410> yeah<00:02:47.390> two<00:02:48.390> hundred<00:02:48.540> blocks<00:02:48.810> YMS<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.230> we

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
oh yeah two hundred blocks YMS so we

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.650 
oh yeah two hundred blocks YMS so we
also<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> message<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.820> how<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.209> go

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
also get the message so how do I go

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.030 
also get the message so how do I go
about<00:02:51.690> getting<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.110> message<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.800> far

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
about getting a message if I'm this far

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
about getting a message if I'm this far
away<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.400> can't<00:02:53.430> right-click<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
away and I can't right-click it so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.770 
away and I can't right-click it so
pretty<00:02:56.400> much<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:56.910> you'd<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.600> in

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
pretty much what you'd have to do in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.270 
pretty much what you'd have to do in
fact<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.350> get<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> compass<00:03:00.290> okay<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.650> then<00:03:01.920> with

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
fact is get a compass okay and then with

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.400 
fact is get a compass okay and then with
the<00:03:02.459> compass<00:03:02.970> you'd<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.050> right-click

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
the compass you'd have to right-click

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710 
the compass you'd have to right-click
and<00:03:04.739> then<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.190> should<00:03:05.340> come<00:03:05.580> up<00:03:05.730> with<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:06.180> tuning

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and then it should come up with a tuning

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.720 
and then it should come up with a tuning
radio<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:08.420> something<00:03:09.420> along<00:03:09.900> those<00:03:10.080> lines<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
radio or something along those lines and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.900 
radio or something along those lines and
what<00:03:15.510> tends<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.019> happen<00:03:16.140> as<00:03:16.620> well<00:03:16.799> is<00:03:17.130> if

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
what tends to happen as well is if

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.830 
what tends to happen as well is if
you're<00:03:18.660> in<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.049> range<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.620> two<00:03:19.860> antennas<00:03:20.400> and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
you're in a range of two antennas and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.080 
you're in a range of two antennas and
one<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.959> them<00:03:22.079> has<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> larger<00:03:22.769> range<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
one of them has a larger range the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.569 
one of them has a larger range the
compass<00:03:24.570> does<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.989> fact<00:03:25.170> lock-on<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> so

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
compass does in fact lock-on so that so

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.160 
compass does in fact lock-on so that so
rather<00:03:26.850> than<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.239> pointing<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> towards<00:03:28.079> a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
rather than it pointing you towards a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.350 
rather than it pointing you towards a
spool<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.650> all<00:03:28.739> your<00:03:28.890> bed<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.910> would<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.329> fact

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
spool and all your bed it would in fact

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.030 
spool and all your bed it would in fact
point<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.049> towards<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.470> antenna

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
point you towards that antenna

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.830 
point you towards that antenna
oh<00:03:32.220> yeah<00:03:32.850> it's<00:03:33.000> point<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:33.390> me<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.660> one

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
oh yeah it's point for me to this one

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.530 
oh yeah it's point for me to this one
over<00:03:33.870> here<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:37.040> see<00:03:38.040> yes<00:03:38.190> pretty<00:03:38.430> cool<00:03:38.609> I'm<00:03:39.420> just

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
over here I see yes pretty cool I'm just

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.270 
over here I see yes pretty cool I'm just
looking<00:03:39.840> at<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> thread<00:03:40.230> now<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.799> sane

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
looking at the thread now in a sane

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.300 
looking at the thread now in a sane
stuff<00:03:41.640> like<00:03:41.820> when<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.660> weather<00:03:42.870> maybe<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.160> is

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
stuff like when the weather maybe it is

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.860 
stuff like when the weather maybe it is
raining<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:45.510> young<00:03:45.870> range<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:46.920> decrease

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
raining and young range will decrease

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.539 
raining and young range will decrease
yeah<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.500> thundering<00:03:49.950> or<00:03:50.100> slightly

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
yeah if it's thundering or slightly

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.000 
yeah if it's thundering or slightly
increase<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:52.079> with<00:03:52.320> whether<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.980> fact

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
increase and then with whether in fact

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.310 
increase and then with whether in fact
the<00:03:53.430> lightning<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.239> actually<00:03:54.690> strike<00:03:55.049> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
the lightning can actually strike the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
the lightning can actually strike the
antennas<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.510> in<00:03:57.510> some<00:03:57.930> cases<00:03:58.200> destroy<00:03:59.070> them

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
antennas and in some cases destroy them

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.080 
antennas and in some cases destroy them
and<00:03:59.579> even<00:04:00.120> pile<00:04:00.359> them<00:04:00.570> up<00:04:01.070> now<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.820> thread

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and even pile them up now on the thread

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.720 
and even pile them up now on the thread
in<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.480> tips<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.290> tricks'<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.890> does<00:04:05.250> say<00:04:05.549> if

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
in the tips and tricks' it does say if

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.039 
in the tips and tricks' it does say if
you're<00:04:05.910> worried<00:04:06.239> about<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.630> lightning

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
you're worried about the lightning

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.789 
you're worried about the lightning
strikes<00:04:07.700> you<00:04:08.700> can<00:04:08.970> tweak<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.049> config

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
strikes you can tweak it on the config

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.250 
strikes you can tweak it on the config
file<00:04:11.100> or<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:13.109> in<00:04:13.260> fact<00:04:13.790> put<00:04:14.790> around

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
file or you can can in fact put around

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.349 
file or you can can in fact put around

see

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
see

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.050 
see
there<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> way<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.009> stop<00:04:23.490> them<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.850> don't

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
there is a way to stop them you don't

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.330 
there is a way to stop them you don't
want<00:04:24.240> there<00:04:24.990> isn't<00:04:25.440> eating<00:04:25.889> ice<00:04:26.729> cookin<00:04:28.340> there

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
want there isn't eating ice cookin there

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.670 
want there isn't eating ice cookin there
is<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.479> permission<00:04:31.020> notes<00:04:31.229> as<00:04:31.500> well

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
is just to permission notes as well

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.620 
is just to permission notes as well
which<00:04:31.919> is<00:04:32.100> pretty<00:04:32.340> simple<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:33.000> it's<00:04:33.150> radio

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
which is pretty simple and it's radio

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.379 
which is pretty simple and it's radio
beacon<00:04:34.110> dollar<00:04:34.320> bill<00:04:34.680> which<00:04:35.490> allows<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.330> to

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
beacon dollar bill which allows you to

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.659 
beacon dollar bill which allows you to
list<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.930> coordinates<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.949> all<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.310> antennas

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
list the coordinates of all the antennas

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.469 
list the coordinates of all the antennas
and<00:04:39.120> also<00:04:40.020> radio<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.530> beacon<00:04:41.210> admin<00:04:42.210> which

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
and also radio and beacon admin which

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.629 
and also radio and beacon admin which
allows<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.139> use<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.800> save<00:04:44.070> load<00:04:44.430> and

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
allows you to use the save load and

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.680 
allows you to use the save load and
repair<00:04:45.240> antennas<00:04:45.810> commands<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.560> think<00:04:47.690> yeah

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
repair antennas commands I think yeah

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.290 
repair antennas commands I think yeah
quite<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.199> cool<00:04:49.470> funky<00:04:49.889> bell-bottom<00:04:50.039> yep<00:04:51.000> and

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
quite a cool funky bell-bottom yep and

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.659 
quite a cool funky bell-bottom yep and
there<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:51.930> only<00:04:52.110> free<00:04:52.470> commands<00:04:52.889> which<00:04:53.220> only

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
there is only free commands which only

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.610 
there is only free commands which only
admins<00:04:54.240> or<00:04:54.479> ops<00:04:54.690> would<00:04:54.930> really<00:04:55.169> year<00:04:55.440> is

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
admins or ops would really year is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.510 
admins or ops would really year is
enough<00:04:55.919> for<00:04:56.729> slash<00:04:57.060> antenna<00:04:57.509> save<00:04:58.520> antennas

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
enough for slash antenna save antennas

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.140 
enough for slash antenna save antennas
load<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.259> antennas<00:05:01.259> check<00:05:01.699> so<00:05:02.699> that<00:05:02.729> just

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
load and antennas check so that just

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.310 
load and antennas check so that just
forces<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.190> antennas<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.280> be<00:05:05.370> saves<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.910> disk

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
forces the antennas to be saves the disk

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.430 
forces the antennas to be saves the disk
yeah<00:05:07.320> like<00:05:07.979> this<00:05:08.180> saves<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.449> as<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.960> file<00:05:10.289> name

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
yeah like this saves it as the file name

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.589 
yeah like this saves it as the file name
and<00:05:10.949> tenant<00:05:11.370> stop<00:05:11.610> wire<00:05:11.970> now<00:05:12.470> awesome<00:05:13.500> I

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
and tenant stop wire now awesome I

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.870 
and tenant stop wire now awesome I
always<00:05:15.599> say<00:05:15.930> if<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.470> click<00:05:16.979> on<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.220> if<00:05:17.610> you
