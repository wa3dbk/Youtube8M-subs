00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.709
 novice art 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.819
 I need to start as a group session twice 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.229

 in a group of alexander in our girls 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.709
 the lesson begins with a warm-up then 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.139
 practicing dance 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:52.849
 items 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.749
 each of them memorized separately 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.689
 during the performance of the Dutch dance 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.489

 what it is 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.479
 while the torso head and shoulders should 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.099
 stay still 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.259
 hands at the seams 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.949
 as a result, after several months 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.349
 workouts legs become similar 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.079
 on the feet of ancient greek 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.329

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.509
 here there is a separate subject 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.239
 talk 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.329
 such shoes are even specialized 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.399

 from the spot does not force the garden on the buyer then 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:42.859
 there is 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.029
 those have been proven 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.629
 later when 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.919
 a third of all those who come 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.979
 this was not enough 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.859
 traditionally with german dances 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.329
 perform boring 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.349
 today for great entertainment 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.759
 performing the same movements right away 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.089
 several dancers 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.789
 but how does the sound of the station change? 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.789
 nearly two dozen people are involved 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.590
 Ksenia and caressing culture fascinated 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.779

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.370
 Here is the peak dance decided to join 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.800
 speaks in them special energy laid 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.169
 for example after skipping one 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.220
 fire training 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.350
 as soon as we start leaving 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.810
 the place where she intends to raise prices 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.479
 nicely 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.650
 Katya as soon though results from 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.599
 little kids it doesn't come four 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:36.889
 of the year 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.189
 analogue of days it certainly depends on 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:41.330
 the kids themselves 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.409
 the percentage also depends on how 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.610
 much they will be engaged to get years 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.169
 came much later I came at 14 that ticket 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.750
 and I was engaged he was not the year when 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.800
 shot seven times a week that's why 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.389
 run wild Iranian to the theater of hectares 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.860

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.950
 like russian dancing 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.349
 in the meantime 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.339
 parsley and female dance 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.509
 share 9 co-owner on the cover 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:16.960
 except it's cold 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.589
 he did 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:21.199
 they have completely different movements 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.930
 boys her and not accepted to do it 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.689
 hanka movement 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.460
 Well, let's say mommy 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.960
 this is a movement with arms and legs 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.819
 initially when 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.139
 and hands in the Irish dance do not exist and he 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.309
 no busy 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:36.650
 but if one scenes 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.740
 and do not give scenic options 300 you can 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.940
 use but loco and if the championship 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.590
 translation if purely peoples time 5 meters 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.930
 this is the value of Iranian dancing that the lessons are not 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.240
 and why come from 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.750
 a lot of deaths are lost 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.949
 new one is that 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.740
 Japanese sailors 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.009
 journey drove into the hold 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.469
 work there was so crowded 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.539
 and that's what they danced couldn't 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.199
 for all the action and hands but the schedule of legends 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.289
 the percentage also that vaenga kettle 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.319
 facilitating that when Britain is not 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.150
 itar tass such data at the station here 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.240
 also so that it is very noticeable that the pastor 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.669
 sandy dance officially give 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.779
 whom he expresses to the act normal 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:21.040
 refuse not to engage 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.420
 these are my competitors so far 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.980
 hard 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.319
 soft 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.649
 these tough measures I propose to do 

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.229
 more space so that you were where 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.460
 turn around to Irish sailors 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.439
