00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.540
 Some live for their property. 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.980
 Some just live for fame. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.300
 Some live for power. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.080
 Some people just live to play. 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.220
 Some people have a material 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.880
 I think it defines the inside of a person. 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.120
 I used to be there. 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 But such a life is a boring life, 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.620
 It's full of superficial things. 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.260
 Some people want it all. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.980
 I do not need one. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.620
 If it's not you baby 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.540
 If I do not have you baby 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.500
 Some people want a diamond ring. 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.100
 Some people just want everything. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.720
 But that does not make any sense. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.320
 If I do not have you yeah 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.300
 Some people look for a fountain that promises eternal youth. 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.520
 Some people need only a dozen roses. 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.440
 For him it's the only way you can show love. 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.060
 Put the world on a silver plate and give it to me. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.880
 What good is it to do? 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.200
 Unless you have someone to share. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.220
 Unless there is anyone who truly cares for me. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 Someone wants all of that. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.780
 But I do not want anything. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800
 If it's not you baby 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.780
 If I do not have you baby 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.040
 Some people want a diamond ring. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.880
 Some people just want everything. 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.680
 But everything does not make any sense. 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.300
 Without you, you, without you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480
 Some people want it all. 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.320
 But I do not need anything. 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.880
 If it's not you baby 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.920
 If I do not have you baby 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.180
 Some people want a diamond ring. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.920
 Some people just want everything. 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.760
 But everything does not make any sense. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.160
 If I do not have you yeah 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.040
 If you are not around me baby 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.660
 So if anything in the whole world has no meaning 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.540
 (No use) If you are not around me baby
