players on passing success rate and when

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
players on passing success rate and when
this<00:01:44.520> guy<00:01:44.790> gets<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.329> ball<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.810> area<00:01:46.140> the

this guy gets the ball in this area the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
this guy gets the ball in this area the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
field how good is he doing this or doing

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
field how good is he doing this or doing
that<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.100> start<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> build<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.790> better

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that so we start to build a better

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.560 
that so we start to build a better

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
in certain situations and what actually

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
in certain situations and what actually
happens<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> game<00:01:57.240> he's<00:01:57.869> done<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> great<00:01:58.229> job

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
