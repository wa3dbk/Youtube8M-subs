00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.050
 I've wanted to know the weight for a long time 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.779
 in the moon I had seen it by pictures what 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.970
 I had seen on Facebook but still not 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.310
 I had been able to see the weather is a 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.360
 space created with a lot of dedication and 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.850
 very much love for yoyo santibáñez 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 she has studied arts therapies 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.020
 Expressive has a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:46.140
 in action and a connection with children 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.910
 incredible and how the dog was born 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.380
 the city of arts therapy 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.710
 expressive that was the mastery that I 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.780
 I started studying four years ago and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.180
 when I started studying the mastery of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 therapy this was my art space here 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
 I worked I am sculptors and enrique 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 paint and here I worked stone had 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.880
 my sincere and hammers my machines but 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.190
 when I started after studying that of the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 art therapy mobilized a lot of 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.170
 things in my life then one of the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.409
 things that stuck with me was like the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.630
 first the first theory that came in was 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 the safe space then I wanted that 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.350
 this is a safe space I did not know 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 that I was going to work with children I wanted 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.910
 work with adults but that's when I 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.340
 I realized that the child was the door 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.619
 quick to enter the adult to the mother 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 to the family to the woman then from 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.720
 I rang the bell and he told me it was a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.490
 absolutely free space had children 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.929
 everywhere children urge for all 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.539
 some climbed on the tree others 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.520
 painting some planting there were children 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.360
 everywhere they were doing 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.360
 they were being children 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.360
 ah 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.070
 I see children of all ages doing 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.079
 a little bit of everything we parted 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.090
 by ages because we believe that wealth 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.909
 of age is very important when you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.789
 mix children of 4 or 5 years with children from 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.180
 11 12 there is an important interaction that 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.640
 that's rich then we do not want to lose 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.650
 that this is a more or less replica of 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
 what we worked what we played in the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.569
 neighborhood is something that already at a level 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.030
 you lost who plays in the neighborhood no longer 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.310
 there's a neighborhood that lifts them up, me what's up 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.900
 when these children you give them so much 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.519
 freedom in the company on the moon enters 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.430
 to a more structured space because 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.180
 really the colleges are have rules 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.980
 and there is a much more rigid system she 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 he told me that nothing happens that what 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.540
 you are giving is the possibility of knowing 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.599
 that there are other spaces that there are other 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.760
 ways of relating and it's true is the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.090
 childhood is for adults as a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.269
 joy bench 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.190
 it's like with a reservation that you carry 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.349
 with you throughout life we ​​are like 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.720
 close as I could say as a trunk of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.220
 surprises we all manage many 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.010
 techniques population then 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.480
 we have 5 of circus teachers 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.879
 they are coming from teachers who are 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.530
 musicians teachers that are art that 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.049
 come from the plastic arts of 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.150
 performing arts but we all work in 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.489
 something that we call an art community 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.560
 the game is at the base then we do 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.840
 many things in the day but then we 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.150
 we put together to share everything that is 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.010
 did in the day that 's what enriches 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.930
 the project and work on the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.200
 space I loved 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.750
 make it a free space that are children 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.689
 of all ages as it was before playing 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.730
 in the park or in the neighborhood I loved it 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.760
 see how it relates to the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.040
 children accompanying them because they do not 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 would call teachers is not a tree that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.950
 the boys have adopted and called and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:57.160
 It has its name 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:59.480
 powell is called fornell and has every 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 Ribbon is the name of one of the children 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.090
 because they have made a commitment to take care 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.550
 to the trees then they have all the 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.550
 commitment and they have put it on the ribbons 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.490
 this place is called the refuge then 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.370
 whenever things happen from stories 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.650
 theater shadow puppets of the game 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.719
 of role then it is for the space of 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.259
 those who arrived that day with the energy 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:37.479
 shorter because it was never the same 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.599
 is that you want to be a part and you are a pill 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.439
 now many moms worry about 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.030
 prepare the children to be 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.590
 competitive and that they can enter a good 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.479
 school after they can enter a good 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.509
 university but the reality is that a 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.319
 happy child is going to be an adult with a lot 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.319
 more residence
