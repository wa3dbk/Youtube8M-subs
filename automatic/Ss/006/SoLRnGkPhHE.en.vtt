00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.040 
gross I think that he's really been
thinking<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.090> he's<00:00:21.330> trained<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
thinking about this he's trained for it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.779 
thinking about this he's trained for it
and<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> time<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.760> thing

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
and this is the time to do it one thing

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.670 
and this is the time to do it one thing
about<00:00:24.060> his<00:00:24.210> training<00:00:24.449> habit<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
about his training habit I think it's a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.170 
about his training habit I think it's a
credit<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> his<00:00:26.220> ability<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.880> his<00:00:27.060> own

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180

body and maybe some of the coaches

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
body and maybe some of the coaches
should<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.250> note<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.880> learn<00:00:30.210> from<00:00:30.420> him<00:00:30.689> he

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
should take note and learn from him he

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.840 
should take note and learn from him he
knows<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> takes<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.309> become<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.610> winner

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
knows what it takes to become a winner

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.130
