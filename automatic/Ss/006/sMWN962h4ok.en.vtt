quad-core<00:01:04.360> processor<00:01:05.360> inside<00:01:06.399> wow<00:01:07.399> it's<00:01:07.670> uh

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
quad-core processor inside wow it's uh

pretty<00:01:08.930> big<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.440> said<00:01:09.500> 5.5<00:01:10.159> inch<00:01:10.369> display

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
pretty big like I said 5.5 inch display

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.850 
pretty big like I said 5.5 inch display
it's<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.360> little<00:01:11.570> heavy<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:11.960> I'm<00:01:12.170> guessing<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
it's a little heavy so I'm guessing the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.260 
it's a little heavy so I'm guessing the
batteries<00:01:13.189> already<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:13.549> I<00:01:13.789> don't<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:14.030> the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
batteries already in I don't think the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.270 
batteries already in I don't think the
battery<00:01:14.569> is<00:01:14.630> removable<00:01:14.929> actually<00:01:15.619> in<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
battery is removable actually in the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.889 
battery is removable actually in the
first<00:01:16.520> place<00:01:16.819> so<00:01:17.440> right<00:01:18.440> away<00:01:18.590> like<00:01:19.130> I<00:01:19.250> said<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
first place so right away like I said a

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.760 
first place so right away like I said a
decent<00:01:20.899> amount<00:01:21.080> of<00:01:21.110> weight<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.319> it<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:21.679> it

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
decent amount of weight to it but it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.190 
decent amount of weight to it but it
feels<00:01:21.979> pretty<00:01:22.130> premium<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.149> I'm<00:01:23.899> not<00:01:24.020> too

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
feels pretty premium so I'm not too

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.029 
feels pretty premium so I'm not too
worried<00:01:24.380> about<00:01:24.440> that

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
worried about that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.440 
worried about that
let's<00:01:25.220> go<00:01:25.340> ahead<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.700> power<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.149> and<00:01:26.210> while

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
let's go ahead and power it on and while

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.680 
let's go ahead and power it on and while
it<00:01:26.539> powers<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.360> rest<00:01:29.539> of<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.690 
it powers on so it's in the rest of the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
at all so it's actually pretty easy to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.770 
at all so it's actually pretty easy to
grip<00:02:27.830> you'll<00:02:28.610> see<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> flash<00:02:29.120> up<00:02:29.330> at<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.450> top<00:02:29.629> of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
camera and then volume rockers are

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.559 
camera and then volume rockers are
pretty<00:02:33.250> embedded<00:02:34.250> into<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.580> phone<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.120> mean

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
pretty embedded into the phone I mean

pretty embedded into the phone I mean
there<00:02:35.720> there<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.140> definitely<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.650> difference

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
there there is definitely a difference

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.339

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.740 
interesting thing I'm noticing down the
bottom<00:03:19.370> left<00:03:19.580> you'll<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.970> speaker<00:03:20.540> but

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.150 
you'll see the speaker grill on the back
it's<00:03:23.720> actually<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:24.080> lot<00:03:24.380> bigger<00:03:24.710> I'm<00:03:25.010> not

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
it's actually a lot bigger I'm not

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.230 
it's actually a lot bigger I'm not
exactly<00:03:25.400> sure<00:03:25.580> why<00:03:25.790> they<00:03:25.910> do<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.150> because

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
exactly sure why they do that because

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.510 
exactly sure why they do that because
you'll<00:03:26.480> see<00:03:26.810> they<00:03:27.020> fill<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.100> here<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.430> the

you'll see they fill it up here on the
left<00:03:28.730> side<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.360> noise<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.780> only<00:03:29.930> gonna

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
left side so the noise is only gonna

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.840 
left side so the noise is only gonna
come<00:03:30.290> up<00:03:30.410> this<00:03:30.530> little<00:03:30.830> section<00:03:31.130> on<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.640> back
