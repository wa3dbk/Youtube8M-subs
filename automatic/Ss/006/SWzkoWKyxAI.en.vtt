00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
work so it's a using Java seen how to

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:10.450 
work so it's a using Java seen how to
have<00:05:03.320> java<00:05:03.560> installed<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:07.690> eventually<00:05:09.460> will

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
have java installed and eventually will

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.060 
have java installed and eventually will
it<00:05:10.580> work

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.670 

it's<00:05:14.520> connecting<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.200> web<00:05:16.380> view

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
it's connecting this is the web view

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.460 
it's connecting this is the web view
live<00:05:16.950> scope<00:05:17.340> now<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.390> also<00:05:18.840> got<00:05:19.080> thing<00:05:19.290> here

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
live scope now you also got thing here

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.970 
live scope now you also got thing here
that<00:05:19.500> says<00:05:19.770> start<00:05:19.920> control<00:05:20.540> so<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:22.650> looks<00:05:22.800> to

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
that says start control so this looks to

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.180 
that says start control so this looks to
be<00:05:23.010> a<00:05:23.130> feed<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:25.430> another<00:05:26.430> road<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:26.940> think<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:28.190> it

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
be a feed of another road I think so it

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.320 
be a feed of another road I think so it
doesn't<00:05:29.430> look<00:05:29.490> like<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:29.730> loading<00:05:30.120> properly

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
doesn't look like this loading properly

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.600 
doesn't look like this loading properly
oh<00:05:30.600> well<00:05:31.170> well<00:05:31.590> basically<00:05:32.100> you<00:05:32.340> can<00:05:32.460> press

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
oh well well basically you can press

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.220 
oh well well basically you can press
Start<00:05:32.850> control<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.420> you<00:05:33.540> can<00:05:33.600> do<00:05:33.840> things<00:05:34.050> as

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
Start control and you can do things as

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.720 
Start control and you can do things as
well<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:34.620> these<00:05:35.070> are<00:05:35.250> things<00:05:35.400> you<00:05:35.460> can

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
well so these are things you can

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.240 
well so these are things you can
sometimes<00:05:36.510> control<00:05:36.960> it<00:05:37.530> doesn't<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.890> may<00:05:38.190> be

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
sometimes control it doesn't it may be

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.710 
sometimes control it doesn't it may be
the<00:05:38.430> screen<00:05:38.670> recorders<00:05:39.090> bugger<00:05:39.360> on<00:05:39.480> up<00:05:39.630> a

the screen recorders bugger on up a
little<00:05:39.930> bit<00:05:40.050> but<00:05:40.640> this<00:05:41.640> just<00:05:41.790> looks<00:05:42.000> to<00:05:42.120> be<00:05:42.240> or

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
little bit but this just looks to be or

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.750 
little bit but this just looks to be or
I<00:05:42.600> don't<00:05:42.660> know<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.870> runway<00:05:43.410> or<00:05:43.560> something<00:05:43.860> so
