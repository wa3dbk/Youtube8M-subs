how<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.939> need<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.200> actual<00:01:46.500> dotting

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
how much I need on the actual dotting

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.200 
how much I need on the actual dotting
tool<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.790> sizes

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
tool and it can be different sizes

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.789 
tool and it can be different sizes
because<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.619> not

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
because that's how you know it's not

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.210 
because that's how you know it's not
perfectly<00:01:50.430> round<00:01:50.579> each<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.040> then<00:01:53.040> when

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
perfectly round each one and then when

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.160 
perfectly round each one and then when
they<00:01:53.399> transition<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.180> colors<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.990> looks

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
they transition into colors it looks

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
they transition into colors it looks
like<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> machine<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.640> made<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> candy

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
like the machine that made the candy

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
like the machine that made the candy
dots<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.350> picks<00:01:58.740> up<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.070> next

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
dots just actually picks up the next

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.730 
dots just actually picks up the next
color<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.240> blends<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.500> instead

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
color and it kind of blends so instead

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
color and it kind of blends so instead
of<00:02:01.799> jumping<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.490> yellow<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> found<00:02:03.420> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
of jumping into yellow I found that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630 
of jumping into yellow I found that
actually<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.350> into<00:02:04.560> orange<00:02:04.979> made<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> look

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
actually going into orange made it look

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
actually going into orange made it look
the<00:02:05.880> most<00:02:06.060> realistic<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> blend<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.220> bit

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the most realistic and so I blend a bit

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
the most realistic and so I blend a bit
of<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> pink<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> orange<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> kind

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of the pink with the orange for the kind

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.380 
of the pink with the orange for the kind
of<00:02:10.229> transition<00:02:11.069> row<00:02:11.280> between<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.879> pink<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of transition row between the pink and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.310 
of transition row between the pink and
the<00:02:12.660> yellow

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.020 

so<00:02:16.320> there's<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.860> orange<00:02:17.310> because<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.820> pink

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so there's the orange because the pink

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.520 
so there's the orange because the pink
and<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.240> yellow<00:02:18.330> really<00:02:18.870> wasn't<00:02:19.200> making<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and the yellow really wasn't making that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
and the yellow really wasn't making that
type<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.860> orange<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.520> me<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:20.940> chose

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
type of orange for me so I just chose

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.250 
type of orange for me so I just chose
that<00:02:21.630> route<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:22.950> yellow<00:02:23.990> I'll<00:02:24.990> do<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
that route and then yellow I'll do a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
that route and then yellow I'll do a
couple<00:02:25.740> dots<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.070> same

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
couple dots of this and this is the same

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.760 
couple dots of this and this is the same
yellow<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.610> used<00:02:32.910> for<00:02:33.060> my<00:02:33.240> first<00:02:33.570> people<00:02:34.140> again

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
yellow I used for my first people again

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.260 
yellow I used for my first people again
all<00:02:34.920> colors<00:02:35.310> will<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.610> listed<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
all colors will be listed in the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.040 
all colors will be listed in the
description<00:02:36.390> box<00:02:36.960> below<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.440> video<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:39.050> then

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
description box below the video and then

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.930 
description box below the video and then
to<00:02:40.230> transition<00:02:40.860> into<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> blue<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> went<00:02:41.820> with

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
to transition into the blue I went with

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.410 
to transition into the blue I went with
a<00:02:41.970> green<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.800> know<00:02:43.920> instead<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.370> blending<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
a green you know instead of blending the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
a green you know instead of blending the
colors<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.020> said<00:02:46.230> before<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.400> get

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
colors like I said before and then get

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.440 
colors like I said before and then get
the<00:02:47.760> perfect<00:02:48.210> amount<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.900> both<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:50.450> tap

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the perfect amount of both and just tap

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.120 
the perfect amount of both and just tap
it<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> ends<00:02:52.170> there<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.890> looks<00:02:53.040> just

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it on the ends there and it looks just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.460 
it on the ends there and it looks just
like<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.580> do<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.060> candy<00:02:54.720> papers<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.320> like

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
like they do on the candy papers I like

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
like they do on the candy papers I like
the<00:02:55.620> transition<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.280> colors<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.600> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
the transition of colors and on the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.460 
the transition of colors and on the
pinky<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.080> start<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> blue<00:02:58.950> green<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.480> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
pinky I start with a blue green and so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.260 
pinky I start with a blue green and so
this<00:03:01.650> one<00:03:01.830> starts<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.970> then<00:03:03.060> goes

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
this one starts with that and then goes

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.350 
this one starts with that and then goes
in<00:03:03.570> kind<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.130> as<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.820> paper<00:03:06.030> than

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
in kind of as it would on the paper than

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
in kind of as it would on the paper than
the<00:03:06.540> pink<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:08.900> then<00:03:09.900> I'll<00:03:10.050> kind<00:03:10.230> of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
the pink and then I'll kind of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.020 
the pink and then I'll kind of
transition<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.070> found<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.370> between<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.700> pink

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
transition I found that between the pink

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.090 
transition I found that between the pink
and<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.300> blue<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.750> didn't<00:03:13.020> do<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.830> much<00:03:13.890> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
and the blue it didn't do it so much so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.900 
and the blue it didn't do it so much so
maybe<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.270> do<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.390> purple<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.080> want

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
maybe you can do the purple if you want

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.370 
maybe you can do the purple if you want
but<00:03:17.910> here<00:03:18.090> I'm<00:03:18.180> mixing<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.750> orange<00:03:19.080> because

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
but here I'm mixing the orange because

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.110 
but here I'm mixing the orange because
my<00:03:19.500> orange<00:03:19.770> wasn't<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.190> opaque<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:20.880> probably

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
my orange wasn't is opaque is I probably

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.350 
my orange wasn't is opaque is I probably
should<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.570> used<00:03:22.610> but<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.790> makes<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.150> really

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
should have used but that makes a really

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.540 
should have used but that makes a really
nice<00:03:24.570> color<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:28.560> do<00:03:28.800> your<00:03:28.920> yellow<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
nice color and then do your yellow and

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.920 
nice color and then do your yellow and
then<00:03:29.700> these<00:03:29.820> will<00:03:29.880> need<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:30.420> time<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.750> dry

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
then these will need some time to dry

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.390 
then these will need some time to dry
before<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.320> do<00:03:31.440> your<00:03:31.470> top<00:03:31.740> coat<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.190> you

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
before you do your top coat because you

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100 
before you do your top coat because you
don't<00:03:32.520> want<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.700> smear<00:03:32.940> them<00:03:33.150> everywhere<00:03:33.510> and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
don't want to smear them everywhere and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.540 
don't want to smear them everywhere and
I'm<00:03:34.200> using<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> chocolate<00:03:35.070> brown<00:03:35.280> color

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
I'm using like a chocolate brown color
