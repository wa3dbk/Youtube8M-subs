00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:14.700
 anime that I watched and that I saw 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.029
 recently putt and anime is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.160
 based on the manga of the same name because 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.790
 this is not technology 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:32.969

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.949
 those very short 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:46.769
 he has only ten episodes 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:52.070
 I'll give you a brief summary here at 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:55.159
 history is a newly hired teacher 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.850
 discovers that all students 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:02.210
 women in your new school has a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.030
 excellent aim 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 why are you this excellent aim? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:17.220
 for being students who are not normal in the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.710
 truth in reality they are weapons 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 these waters are pio is excellent 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:34.350
 aim and are they torch well so today 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 I thought it was cool, but the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.800
 The characters' names are also 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.170
 linked with the specific models of 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.240
 the majority of the characters 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.830
 are the girls in high school who 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.750
 are embodied in various versions 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.750
 of firearms 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.920
 the main character is funco those who 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.500
 so speak fun with frank is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:14.070
 literally one 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.430
 a weapon with the name of fm fnc and frite 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.490
 riff dia santo 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.290
 I'm kind of where to say those names then 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:29.880
 we are going on the division of the series 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:33.600
 so in the college they are divided into 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.400
 three submachine guns 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 are grouped in primary education the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.540
 assault rifles 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:50.070
 are 1 of high school and the hits of 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:55.500
 battle are in high school which is a 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.709
 reference higher education is to pass 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.750
 the story will explain why 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:08.430
 each name the origin of this will give in the country and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:14.760
 also the one that has so much rivalry between 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:18.750
 they have lots of nice legal disputes 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 taking the parts out of comedy 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:27.510
 If you're going to have a lot of fun 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.290
 it's not just nice comedy that really 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.750
 quite action scenes with explosions 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.049

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.200

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.049
