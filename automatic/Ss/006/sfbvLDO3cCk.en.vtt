00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.849
 although in Western countries to many 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.590
 people the reincarnation seems to them a 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.660
 somewhat scandalous concept and 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.939
 highly implausible for much 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
 of the world reincarnation is something that 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.449
 part of their religious faith and in 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.240
 many cases of their experiences 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.220
 everyday pursuing this mystery the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.920
 Dr. Jim Tucker of the University of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.930
 virginia has documented more than 2500 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.940
 cases of children who claim to remember lives 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.969
 past continuing the work of 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.710
 famous investigator jean stevens in one 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.359
 of the most outstanding cases of 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.879
 tucker or at least one that has called the 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:42.010
 media attention in the usa is that of the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.719
 young william a 10 year old boy who 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.519
 says to have been an art and martÃ­n a 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.739
 extra that he became an agent in the 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.539
 golden age of hollywood ryan what 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.729
 identified by looking at a picture of a 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.579
 movie of mae west and later under the 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.589
 scrutiny of tucker managed to name 55 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.539
 details of the life of martÃ­n many of 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.729
 which were confirmed by the 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 daughter of the actor including an error in his 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.170
 death certificate 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.119
 you who works these cases with children 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.570
 because they tend to have more freshness 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.280
 memory according to your research 70% of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.350
 children who believe they remember lives 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.869
 past died of violent deaths 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.119
 you consider that your more than 2,000 cases 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.430
 they are reliable proof of a real phenomenon 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.280
 although he does not necessarily believe that he has 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.710
 that being a reincarnation says with the mind 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 open there may be something that survives 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
 to the death of the brain and the death of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.530
 body that is in some way 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.479
 connected to the new child along the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.399
 I 've convinced myself that there is 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.220
 more in the world than the single universe 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.860
 physical there is the mind that is its own 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 entity some people have explained 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.069
 these memories through a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 love or field resonance 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.869
 shared morphogenetic information 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.759
 in the myth of Plato in narrating 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.710
 Republican it is said that all 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.869
 people dying drink from the river of teo 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 that produces a narcotic oblivion in the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.399
 soul some people however not 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.200
 they drink from that river they drink from the river of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.780
 mnemosyne and they can remember their 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.789
 previous incarnations this is a way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.479
 poetic to understand what is undoubtedly 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.479
 a great mystery
