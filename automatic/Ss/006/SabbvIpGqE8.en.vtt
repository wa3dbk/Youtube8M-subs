above<00:00:42.269> which<00:00:42.900> is<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.680> easy<00:00:43.769> thing<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.250> do

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
above which is not an easy thing to do

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
above which is not an easy thing to do
on<00:00:44.400> that<00:00:44.519> little<00:00:44.820> branch<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.659> course<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.019> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
on that little branch of course is a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
on that little branch of course is a
great<00:00:46.290> sign<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.030> with<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> female<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.750> not

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
great sign and with the female now not

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.660 
great sign and with the female now not
being<00:00:49.470> seen<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.980> last<00:00:50.040> few<00:00:50.369> days<00:00:50.640> just

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
being seen for the last few days just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
being seen for the last few days just
the<00:00:51.119> male<00:00:51.330> outside<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:52.049> nest<00:00:52.229> whole<00:00:52.500> almost

the male outside the nest whole almost

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.410 
the male outside the nest whole almost
certainly<00:00:53.580> means<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.000> she's<00:00:54.210> now

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
certainly means that she's now

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.859 
certainly means that she's now
incubating<00:00:55.019> eggs<00:00:55.379> inside<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.089> all<00:00:57.510> being<00:00:57.780> well

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
incubating eggs inside so all being well

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.020 
incubating eggs inside so all being well
we'll<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.290> young<00:00:58.589> kingfishers<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.699> talk
