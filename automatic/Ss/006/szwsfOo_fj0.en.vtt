that was so that if you were a player

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.750 
that was so that if you were a player
you<00:00:45.350> can<00:00:45.530> still<00:00:45.830> get<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.310> the<00:00:48.370> cheaper<00:00:49.370> non

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can still get the the cheaper non

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.500

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
having to go all out which pretty much

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.850 
having to go all out which pretty much
is<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.240> difference<00:00:56.480> between<00:00:56.750> say<00:00:57.620> regular

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
is the difference between say regular

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.710 
is the difference between say regular
e^x<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:58.640> full<00:00:58.850> RDX<00:00:59.330> these<00:00:59.600> days<00:01:00.580> so
