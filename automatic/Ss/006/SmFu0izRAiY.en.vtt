00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.000
 Would you shoot money like that again ? 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.199
 can or maybe just like that 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 or the thing in the top right fully pure 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.480
 shoot 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 then the goal must be in this video 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.270
 stay tuned because I want to stay in here now 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.650
 explain a tutorial video like that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.720
 whole goes 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.880
 First, I would like to explain very briefly 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.170
 how can train a lot because it must 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.449
 you definitely make me this 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.670
 To apply this technique simply in the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.800
 main menu just a bit after 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.930
 go right up to the skill play 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.860
 There you can then equal training Arena 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 choose 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.390
 as soon as you press this athlete is short 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.890
 and then you can use select 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.260
 call another menu where you then 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.330
 emanating standard training and there 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.040
 you get out eleven and then you can 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.870
 those who train in peace and it is 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.629
 no problem with the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.180
 demo then just play there arena 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.619
 Select and hit the ball in the 16s 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.809
 running and then right there 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.769
 control cross shortly to the right or left 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.640
 then you can press there too 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.989
 train eleven meters 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.760
 and here you can see mine right now 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
 first visit is really good 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.799
 and now I want you very briefly 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.570
 explain how to help and 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.580
 you can see here on the top right 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.700
 You can turn on and off targeting 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.860
 you do that with l2 or on the xbox lt 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.229
 and then you can see here like this help 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.060
 is turned on and off that is there 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.250
 you can see directly where you are aiming 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.390
 and you can move it as soon as you get up 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.040
 the shot button presses and not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 explain you then from when you in 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.520
 should pull the corners 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.890
 Now I want to explain to you like you 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.300
 Aiming perfectly at the corners and the whole 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.070
 consists in principle of three steps 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.950
 The first step is that you take this one 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.659
 Sucher the bottom left is in the green 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.340
 should meet area that is called soon 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.920
 this yellow search in the green area 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.659
 press the shift button and then 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 stay that goal-help you have 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.510
 as small as possible that means you have one 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.060
 small deviation what the shot 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.490
 the next one is we 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 determine how strong we shoot 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 say we do so just as 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 if we shoot the goal all the more 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.330
 longer we press the stronger 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.659
 Let's shoot my recommendation is like that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.610
 between 30 and 60 70 per cent which is so 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.140
 what I recommend the stronger man 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.760
 shoots the bigger it will be again 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.830
 Deviation but of course heavier 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.330
 to hold for the offender and the next 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.269
 is really where it comes that 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.190
 we aim and that's what we do in that 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.540
 As soon as we hit the shot 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.980
 have let go that means we have 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.659
 Definitely like shooting strong 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 after that we first start at the left 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.239
 stick in a direction where we push 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.860
 also want to shoot 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.079
 that means in this case I leave the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.549
 shot button go and then start with 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.130
 the left stick to the top left 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.050
 press to 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.030
 left around the corner to shoot purely looks 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.440
 one here now pretty much I press the 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.420
 left stick goes to the top left r 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.340
 perfect left top in and the great 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.170
 we will be exactly in time 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.910
 do not need on the left 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.350
 stick to let go but you can 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.730
 just keep going in this direction 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.710
 At some point it just will not work 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.780
 go further because the player already 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.460
 a shot when it hits home perfectly 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.990
 then really could be in the whole time 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.500
 push a direction and you have it 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.500
 no influence anymore 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.430
 here looks now just two 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.680
 more examples where the sequence 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.569
 So it just becomes clear green 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.940
 hit area hit button and press 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.890
 To determine firing power must let go 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 and then we start with the left one 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.190
 stick in the corner where we go 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 want to shoot and as we said if we 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.489
 Do it right by time interval 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 between shot release button and 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.200
 then start in the direction 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.790
 to press 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.250
 we do not need the left stick anymore 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.989
 You should have problems letting go 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.340
 and always shoot next to the goal then 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.500
 is the distance between letting go 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.030
 shot button and the goal with the left 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.260
 Do not stick big enough that's you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.180
 may have to go a little later 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.060
 start to aim with the left stick 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.530
 because so had the target to 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.120
 long time to go into the corner and 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.580
 That's why you shoot over that is called 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.630
 just start a little later then 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.250
 I just want to be very short 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.019
 Explain that it is for further variations 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.190
 of shots gives the first one is 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.110
 a cut shot or a shot 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.150
 fares schott for easy 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.220
 he shoots once or on the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.260
 xbox is then the player shoots with 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.489
 the inside the target helps remain 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.049
 a bit smaller that means you can 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.709
 shoot accurately this is the shot of a 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.470
 a little weaker 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.109
 then next we have the lock 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.170
 or just the chip for that during the 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.329
 shoot l1 press or on the xbox is 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.010
 slb one has already seen it here 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.030
 There is limited then you can 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.650
 then actually they were only in the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.060
 Shoot in the middle and vary slightly 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.250
 between left and right but not in 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.350
 the corners and the last one is that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.150
 fussing from a shot for it 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.039
 Just shoot and press shortly afterwards 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.870
 press again shoot that is called 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.940
 determining the shot power and squeezed 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.520
 then shoot again very shortly 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.380
 but only and here is the problem that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.580
 then the goals for yourself clearly 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.229
 moves faster and also clearly 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.310
 gets bigger there it is on everyone 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.010
 case very much more demanding 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.050
 to really aim and the right one 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.130
 advantage is that you can see in short 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.039
 which direction possibly with 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.720
 today we will jump on it 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.310
 I end up with this tutorial video
