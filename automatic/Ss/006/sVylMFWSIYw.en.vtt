00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and attention you're swinging your ass

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.950 
and attention you're swinging your ass
around<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.619> pop<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.340> chin<00:01:56.549> over<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> bar<00:01:56.960> if

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
around and pop your chin over the bar if

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.109 
around and pop your chin over the bar if
you<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.259> same<00:01:58.469> exercise<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.909> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you do that same exercise and you take a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.649 
you do that same exercise and you take a
full<00:02:00.689> 4/4<00:02:01.590> approach<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> tempo<00:02:02.939> which

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
full 4/4 approach which is a tempo which

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.810 
full 4/4 approach which is a tempo which
means<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:05.340> three<00:02:06.119> four

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
means one two three four

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.120 
means one two three four
one<00:02:07.940> two<00:02:08.179> three<00:02:08.450> four<00:02:08.660> hold<00:02:08.960> isometric<00:02:09.830> hold

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
one two three four hold isometric hold

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.500 
one two three four hold isometric hold
one<00:02:10.640> two<00:02:10.880> three<00:02:11.090> four<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:13.510> everything

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
one two three four now everything

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
one two three four now everything
changes<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:15.200> volume<00:02:15.680> changes<00:02:16.130> because<00:02:16.310> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
changes your volume changes because you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.660 
changes your volume changes because you
can't<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:17.320> 40<00:02:18.320> of<00:02:18.440> them<00:02:18.560> fuck<00:02:18.980> those<00:02:19.160> 42<00:02:19.430> knows

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
can't do 40 of them fuck those 42 knows

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.440 
can't do 40 of them fuck those 42 knows
and<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.620> mean<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> four<00:02:22.970> four<00:02:23.180> four

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
and so I mean with a four four four

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.480 
and so I mean with a four four four
tempo<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.440> might<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:25.010> able<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.280> eight

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
tempo you might be able to get eight

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.280 
tempo you might be able to get eight
take<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.880> same<00:02:26.320> person<00:02:27.370> that's<00:02:28.370> doing<00:02:28.610> 40

against CrossFit or or or kipping
chin-ups<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.390> part<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> deal

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
chin-ups it's it's a part of the deal

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.560 
chin-ups it's it's a part of the deal
that's<00:02:36.140> what<00:02:36.230> they're<00:02:36.350> doing<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:37.570> but

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
that's what they're doing you know but

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.699 
that's what they're doing you know but
don't<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> want<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> build

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
don't do that if you want to build

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.650 
don't do that if you want to build
muscle<00:02:39.890> mass<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:41.030> take<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.300> same<00:02:41.450> person

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
muscle mass you take that same person

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.260 
muscle mass you take that same person
who<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.930> do<00:02:42.020> 40<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.700> show<00:02:43.700> them<00:02:43.880> how<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> do<00:02:44.239> it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
who can do 40 and show them how to do it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.210 
who can do 40 and show them how to do it
with<00:02:45.080> time<00:02:45.560> under<00:02:45.800> tension

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
with time under tension

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.860 
with time under tension
they're<00:02:46.910> probably<00:02:47.120> they'll<00:02:47.420> probably<00:02:47.600> only

step<00:02:58.970> ups<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.959> can<00:02:59.989> do<00:03:00.230> all<00:03:00.440> those<00:03:00.650> things<00:03:00.980> but

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
step ups you can do all those things but

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.850 
step ups you can do all those things but
manipulate<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.690> variables<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.590> number

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
manipulate the variables and the number

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.850 
manipulate the variables and the number
one<00:03:04.010> variable<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:05.420> number<00:03:05.450> one<00:03:05.900> was<00:03:06.110> thing

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
one variable the number one was thing

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.050 
one variable the number one was thing
that<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:07.100> want<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.459> happen<00:03:07.610> if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:07.940> want

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
that you want to have happen if you want

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.030 
that you want to have happen if you want
to<00:03:08.120> gain<00:03:08.180> mass<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.630> time<00:03:08.840> under<00:03:09.110> tension<00:03:09.140> time

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
to gain mass is time under tension time

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.370 
to gain mass is time under tension time
under<00:03:10.370> tension<00:03:10.400> equals<00:03:11.120> mass<00:03:11.390> time<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
under tension equals mass time and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.699 
under tension equals mass time and
attention<00:03:12.650> basically<00:03:12.950> means<00:03:13.370> how<00:03:13.640> long<00:03:14.239> in

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
attention basically means how long in

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.449 
attention basically means how long in
the<00:03:15.709> in<00:03:16.750> seconds<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:18.019> you<00:03:18.950> putting<00:03:19.130> pressure

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
the in seconds are you putting pressure

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.910 
the in seconds are you putting pressure
on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:20.540> muscle<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.620> can<00:03:21.769> happen

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
on the muscle and that can happen

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.670 
on the muscle and that can happen
through<00:03:22.370> volume<00:03:22.840> frequency<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:24.019> what<00:03:24.620> I'm

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
through volume frequency or what I'm

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.670 
through volume frequency or what I'm
going<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.860> invite<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.430> tempo<00:03:26.680> slow
