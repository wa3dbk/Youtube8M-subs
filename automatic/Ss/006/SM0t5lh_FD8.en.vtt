you can just drizzle that in and you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.850 
you can just drizzle that in and you
really<00:04:56.090> don't<00:04:56.270> have<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.780> measure<00:04:56.990> because<00:04:57.590> you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
really don't have to measure because you

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.550 
really don't have to measure because you
might<00:04:58.039> want<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.370> little<00:04:58.640> bit<00:04:58.760> more<00:04:59.060> so<00:04:59.600> roughly

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
a quarter of a cup and I'm also going to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.850 
a quarter of a cup and I'm also going to
add<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.030> quarter<00:05:05.539> of<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.780> cup<00:05:05.810> of<00:05:06.080> red<00:05:06.560> wine

if<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.290> consultant<00:05:14.010> have<00:05:14.220> their<00:05:14.400> two

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
if it is a consultant have their two

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.120 
if it is a consultant have their two
teams<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.840> again<00:05:16.140> you<00:05:16.260> can<00:05:16.440> always<00:05:16.680> add<00:05:17.100> a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
teams and again you can always add a

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:28.620 
teams and again you can always add a
little<00:05:17.280> bit

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:40.450 

now<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.900> looking<00:05:30.260> really<00:05:30.590> pretty<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:40.160> then

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
now it's looking really pretty and then

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.210 
now it's looking really pretty and then
the<00:05:41.210> best<00:05:41.450> part<00:05:41.810> grab<00:05:42.350> with<00:05:42.590> some<00:05:42.800> tortilla

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
the best part grab with some tortilla

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.040 
the best part grab with some tortilla
chips<00:05:43.310> then<00:05:43.730> give<00:05:43.910> it<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.060> taste<00:05:44.270> because<00:05:44.780> you

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
chips then give it a taste because you

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.710 
chips then give it a taste because you
might<00:05:45.440> want<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.710> adjust<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.310> little<00:05:46.520> bit<00:05:46.760> I'm

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
might want to adjust it a little bit I'm

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720 
might want to adjust it a little bit I'm
going<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.140> add<00:05:48.260> a<00:05:48.290> little<00:05:48.590> more<00:05:48.860> cilantro<00:05:49.220> to

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
going to add a little more cilantro to

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.790 
going to add a little more cilantro to
mine<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:53.240> probably<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.810> little<00:05:54.020> more<00:05:54.230> salt<00:05:54.500> and

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
mine and probably a little more salt and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.390 
mine and probably a little more salt and
then<00:05:55.100> I'll<00:05:55.220> give<00:05:55.400> it<00:05:55.490> another<00:05:55.580> taste<00:06:00.400> it

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
then I'll give it another taste it

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.490 
then I'll give it another taste it
really<00:06:01.700> all<00:06:01.820> depends<00:06:02.270> on<00:06:02.570> your<00:06:02.750> preferences

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
really all depends on your preferences

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.430 
really all depends on your preferences
to<00:06:04.780> what<00:06:05.780> you<00:06:05.900> like

to what you like
I<00:06:07.540> am<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:09.100> flavor<00:06:10.100> queen<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.760> like<00:06:11.060> my<00:06:11.360> food<00:06:11.570> to

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
I am a flavor queen I like my food to

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.540 
I am a flavor queen I like my food to
have<00:06:11.930> a<00:06:12.260> ton<00:06:12.650> of<00:06:12.680> flavor<00:06:13.370> so<00:06:15.100> whenever<00:06:16.100> I<00:06:16.220> make

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
have a ton of flavor so whenever I make

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.110 
have a ton of flavor so whenever I make
another<00:06:17.150> recipe<00:06:17.840> I<00:06:18.610> always<00:06:19.610> add<00:06:19.850> more

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
another recipe I always add more

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.330 
another recipe I always add more
seasoning<00:06:20.330> because<00:06:20.750> that's<00:06:21.230> just<00:06:21.530> what<00:06:21.860> I

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
seasoning because that's just what I

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:39.390 
seasoning because that's just what I
prefer<00:06:23.170> okay<00:06:24.200> so<00:06:24.700> good<00:06:25.700> amount<00:06:25.970> of<00:06:26.060> cilantro

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.520 

salt<00:06:40.400> see<00:06:40.610> a<00:06:40.820> regular<00:06:41.210> salt<00:06:41.720> so<00:06:41.990> maybe<00:06:42.320> that's

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
salt see a regular salt so maybe that's

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:49.030 
salt see a regular salt so maybe that's
why<00:06:46.450> so<00:06:47.450> you<00:06:47.540> can<00:06:47.690> basically<00:06:47.840> just<00:06:48.500> keep

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
why so you can basically just keep

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.110 
why so you can basically just keep
playing<00:06:49.370> with<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.820> and<00:06:50.000> too<00:06:50.740> tightly<00:06:51.740> and

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
playing with that and too tightly and

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.630 
playing with that and too tightly and
I'm<00:06:53.120> sure<00:06:53.450> it's<00:06:54.290> delicious<00:06:54.800> and<00:06:55.310> then<00:06:55.520> you'll

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
I'm sure it's delicious and then you'll

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.370 
I'm sure it's delicious and then you'll
just<00:06:55.730> want<00:06:56.000> to<00:06:56.030> refrigerate<00:06:56.360> this<00:06:56.780> until

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
just want to refrigerate this until

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.100 
just want to refrigerate this until
you're<00:06:57.530> ready<00:06:57.710> to<00:06:57.830> serve<00:06:58.070> it<00:06:58.280> but<00:06:59.120> if<00:06:59.300> you<00:06:59.600> want

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
you're ready to serve it but if you want

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.600 
you're ready to serve it but if you want
to<00:07:00.320> you<00:07:00.440> can<00:07:00.650> serve<00:07:00.950> it<00:07:01.070> right<00:07:01.190> away<00:07:01.250> because

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
to you can serve it right away because

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.820 
to you can serve it right away because
this<00:07:01.940> it's<00:07:02.450> good<00:07:02.750> to<00:07:02.870> go<00:07:02.990> just<00:07:03.380> the<00:07:03.530> way<00:07:03.650> it<00:07:03.710> is

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
this it's good to go just the way it is

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.070 
this it's good to go just the way it is
