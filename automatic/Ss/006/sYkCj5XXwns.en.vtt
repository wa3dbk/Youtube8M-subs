00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
addition get handed down to Natalie so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.080 
addition get handed down to Natalie so
that's<00:01:22.159> what<00:01:22.249> I<00:01:22.279> got<00:01:22.429> from<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.670> Disney<00:01:22.939> Store

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090
