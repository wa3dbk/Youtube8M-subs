every time let's take a quick look at
mistakes<00:01:14.540> that<00:01:14.780> we<00:01:14.960> see<00:01:15.070> when<00:01:16.070> we<00:01:16.220> go<00:01:16.400> through

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
mistakes that we see when we go through

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.420 
mistakes that we see when we go through
we<00:01:17.030> allow<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.390> left<00:01:17.840> post<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.560> slide<00:01:18.890> out<00:01:19.190> and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
we allow the left post to slide out and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.850 
we allow the left post to slide out and
get<00:01:19.550> on<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.820> outside<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.540> foot<00:01:20.870> can't

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
spin very fast on a wobbly post so let's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.820 
spin very fast on a wobbly post so let's
make<00:01:25.220> sure<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.700> snaps<00:01:26.180> up<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:26.690> spins<00:01:27.620> on

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830

make sure that snaps up and spins on
that<00:01:28.070> line<00:01:29.590> another<00:01:30.590> big<00:01:30.860> mistake<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.760> is

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
that line another big mistake we see is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.750 
that line another big mistake we see is
the<00:01:32.870> arms<00:01:33.230> straighten<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.830> way<00:01:34.040> back<00:01:34.310> here

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
the arms straighten out way back here

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.940 
the arms straighten out way back here
before<00:01:35.240> they<00:01:35.360> get<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.840> line<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.710> let's

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
before they get to the line so let's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.610 
before they get to the line so let's
make<00:01:37.250> sure<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.670> elbow<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.300> thigh<00:01:38.620> get
