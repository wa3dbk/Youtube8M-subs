00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
the rest those remaining poles and then

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.700 
the rest those remaining poles and then
uh<00:00:59.220> then<00:00:59.640> button<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.630> uh<00:01:00.720> just<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
uh then button it up and uh just take it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.299 
uh then button it up and uh just take it
out<00:01:01.860> so<00:01:02.730> usually<00:01:03.540> you<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.009> this<00:01:05.100> at

leisurely pace seven minutes is kind of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.450 
leisurely pace seven minutes is kind of
a<00:01:08.009> slow<00:01:08.399> amount<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.149> time<00:01:10.130> there's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> first

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
a slow amount of time there's a first

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.040 
a slow amount of time there's a first
time<00:01:11.610> we've<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.910> TP<00:01:12.330> race<00:01:12.509> here<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> work

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
time we've got a TP race here to work

time we've got a TP race here to work
just<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:14.300> 1977<00:01:15.300> 1960s<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.070> has

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
just probably 1977 1960s so this has

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.910 
just probably 1977 1960s so this has
been<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> long<00:01:17.369> time<00:01:17.670> coming
