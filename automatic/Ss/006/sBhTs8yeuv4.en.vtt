00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello live program 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.240
 auto parts today our release 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.580
 dedicated to shock absorber and interconnected 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.559
 with them spare parts but first in brief 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
 dwell on what is the danger 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 use of a defective shock absorber 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.440
 since the wheel was invented and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
 built the first man cart 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.670
 tirelessly thinking about how to do 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 moving from point a to b more 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 nice car with faulty 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 shock absorbers become dangerous 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.099
 stopping distance increases to 30 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.679
 percent and stability and control 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.750
 decrease it certainly increases 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.489
 probability of hitting a crash or leading to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 creating an emergency on the road 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 also with defective shock absorbers 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 the whole suspension fails faster 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.309
 tires and brakes wear out 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.510
 average service life of the shock absorber 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.390
 ranges from twenty to fifty 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.100
 thousand kilometers for city trips 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 best suited oil 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 country shock absorbers 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.460
 extreme better pick gas oil 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.660
 associated with marti but frame spare parts in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 depending on constructive 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 features of the car include 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.740
 upper shock absorber they are 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.000
 both with the bearing and without it 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.689
 rubber bushings shock absorbers like 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.869
 the rule to such pressure go separately 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.420
 also 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.100
 Tsilin shock absorber blocks bump stop and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 boot that protect what both 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.430
 dirt and sand getting there 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.170
 can cause premature 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630
 shock absorber damage and its exit from 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.200
 building 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 caches and anthers are universal 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.549
 separate remote cologne bump stop and there are 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.990
 goals would n't 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.790
 it is very important to know that before installing 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.400
 shock absorber must be brought into 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.259
 working condition that is to pump not 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.640
 pumped shock very often 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.860
 is the cause of tapping on 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.210
 running on the cold if a bit 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 drive through tapping the case disappear 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.710
 the fact is that during transportation 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.560
 working fluid from the inner cylinder 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.299
 flows in external also 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 gas enters the inner cylinder 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.310
 backwater in this case will be 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.580
 knock on suspension 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.660
 car bypass valve will 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.340
 wear faster 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.989
 in this way in order to 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670
 prevent premature exit from 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.220
 building a shock absorber it is necessary 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 I will show you the technology now 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.600
 pumping cost mcpherson type to start 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.200
 it is necessary to turn the shock absorber 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.350
 rod down and smoothly squeeze without jerking 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.350
 him 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.599
 fix the shock absorber in such 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.540
 position for two three seconds 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:41.409
 holding the pieces turn the shock absorber 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.590
 rod up and lock it at 36 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.329
 seconds will stand shock absorber vertically 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.720
 up stem will need to run 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.720
 additional control procedures 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.129
 sudden movements like up and down 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.280
 to move smoothly without 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.280
 jerking 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.170
 qualitatively pumped shock absorber is 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.650
 smoothly and without failure piston movement 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.480
 after pumping the shock absorber is necessary 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.549
 hold in position that is 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.739
 rod vertically up flesh to full 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.180
 car stop 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.189
 attention not pumped before installation 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 twin tube shock absorber common cause 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.209
 piston system failure 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.769
 shock absorber is a violation of instructions on 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.870
 installation and possible cause not 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.150
 warranty case if inside 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.010
 the shock absorber sleeve remains air 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.290
 shock absorber can not properly perform 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.299
 its function failure results in 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.919
 noise knock when the shock absorber and 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.760
 maybe my premature exit 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 out of service 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.419
 also draw your attention to the fact that 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.310
 small dips in resistance 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.079
 valve mechanism as well as the difference in 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.639
 speeds of an exit of a rod in gas oil 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.859
 shock absorbers is not a malfunction 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.760
 in no way affects the work 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.979
 shock absorber 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.989
 monitor the condition of the shock absorbers and 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.030
 timely replace this 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.840
 elements in the car's suspension as well 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.340
 interrelated details and remember 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.680
 car with broken shock absorber 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420
 how a lame man moves but with 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.520
 great effort and effort 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.520
 successful trips to you and to new meetings
