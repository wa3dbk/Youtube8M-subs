00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:24.880
 hotel hotel and thanks on the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.230
 hotel manager ludwig mÃ¼ller believe in food 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.180
 There was enough to be had on the lot 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.950
 sunday around 1860 Munich stood her 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.170
 Together we have 330,000 tickets 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.170
 being sold from munich will be about 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 two and a half thousand fans expected 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.170
 Referee of the lot is markus 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.000
 schmidt from Stuttgart 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.059
 he has a home game in the last race 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.710
 still in the last mountain on the last 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.570
 and whistled the home game 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.400
 against borussia dortmund zum 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.830
 Seasonal home 300 playful 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.140
 have the way back to the hotel 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:01.900
 as florian dick found at the flow 68 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.170
 by definition one with the climb says 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.059
 you 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.680
 and also designed exactly like the four of us 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.940
 to persuade points or tips against 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.690
 a unterklassige team in the cup 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 come on 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.560
 what do you expect for a game and 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.560
 to carry on water opponents 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.549
 I believe you yourself the claim above 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.010
 play along and if possible to 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.780
 increase as clearly as you do 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.189
 accordingly post-war before the round 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.590
 I think the quality of the purchased good 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.390
 and what the first games showed 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.250
 that already found relatively good 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.719
 but that was why I was a good one 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.109
 team a compact team the 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.549
 you play, however , she comes to the 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.310
 places and we are good too 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.170
 equipped therefore I think that it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.750
 a high-class game is with 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.829
 hopefully good exit for us 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.479
 speaks that a high class yourself 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.369
 strengthened during the week, too 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.929
 new entry with us alexander baumjohann 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.600
 will be found 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.420
 I also think quite well made himself 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.270
 But ask this of feelings I think 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.090
 Fits well as our time just as 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.460
 Kurat run home 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.319
 Nobody can do them well for four days 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.479
 still knows about time on schalke 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.130
 they get on well then yes me 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.009
 think it was more of a quiet one 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.799
 good to us 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.769
 Spectators also accepted the team 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.209
 after the descent last year and she 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.659
 Team has, of course, too 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.090
 she has three good ones for me now 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.810
 We played games over 90 minutes 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.519
 have are undefeated in the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.650
 championship four points 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.329
 So far , we are moving on one very much 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.420
 positive trend and we hope of course 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.069
 that we have this one on sunday with one 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
 home victory can continue but the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.269
 Team is in a good mood 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.890
 very good of course very willing 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.750
 now also through these success experiences 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.989
 in the last play confidence 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.819
 fueled and therefore I assume 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.930
 that's why we're a very good one 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.690
 we will hopefully play 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.670
 a great audience 860 people 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.299
 Secure candidates for the climb 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.530
 will play 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.569
 they got on well with 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.340
 markus but unfortunately is injured 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.069
 or who has hurt himself and with 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.280
 Thomas often really have them very much 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.639
 Good players have come to it and they have 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.470
 engage in different positions 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.629
 individual class reinforced and 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.220
 insofar is a team in the 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.000
 Last year already at the end of the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.199
 championship has landed in front and the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.180
 certainly in the lead this year 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.799
 so I think so 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.510
 we are very good game, a 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.769
 top game and therefore become 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.769
 of course many too
