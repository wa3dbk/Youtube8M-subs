okay here we go again outfitting the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay here we go again outfitting the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
Harbor Freight trencher with a diesel

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.720 
Harbor Freight trencher with a diesel
engine<00:00:06.600> now<00:00:07.400> try<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:09.260> that's<00:00:10.260> our<00:00:10.800> our<00:00:11.429> next

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
engine now try this that's our our next

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.870 
engine now try this that's our our next
project<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:13.080> we've<00:00:13.259> got<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.500> pretty<00:00:14.130> much

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:29.290 

taken<00:00:17.880> down<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:26.789> engine<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.630> long<00:00:27.900> top

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
taken down the the engine is a long top

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
taken down the the engine is a long top
diesel<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.570> 10<00:00:31.380> horsepower<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:32.279> it's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
diesel it's 10 horsepower but it's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
diesel it's 10 horsepower but it's
probably<00:00:33.329> more<00:00:33.660> than<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.160> they're

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
probably more than that they're

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
probably more than that they're
underrated<00:00:35.690> that's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.840> llamar<00:00:37.670> copy<00:00:39.710> before<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
underrated that's a llamar copy before I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
underrated that's a llamar copy before I
put<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> ran<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.030> engine<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:44.960> 12

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
put it on I ran this engine about 12

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.470 
put it on I ran this engine about 12
hours<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.989> with<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> light<00:00:49.289> load<00:00:49.559> under<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.480> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
hours and with a light load under it and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
hours and with a light load under it and
on<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:52.020> guess<00:00:52.640> just<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.170> break<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
on it I guess just to break it in and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.389 
on it I guess just to break it in and
then<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.570> stopped<00:00:57.870> smoking<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.739> start

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
then they stopped smoking and start

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.160 
then they stopped smoking and start
running<00:00:59.789> real<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.750> one's<00:01:00.960> running

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
running real good and this one's running

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
running real good and this one's running
real<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.160> had<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> jig<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.640> let

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
real good now I had it on a jig and let

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.890 
real good now I had it on a jig and let
it<00:01:05.790> run<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:07.040> running<00:01:08.040> real<00:01:08.250> good<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.790> ready<00:01:09.689> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it run and running real good so ready to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
it run and running real good so ready to
put<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.270> next<00:01:12.270> couple<00:01:12.630> hours<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:15.150> should

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
put it on so next couple hours we should

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.170 
put it on so next couple hours we should
have<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.930> also<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.890> beefing<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.740 

coupler<00:01:21.770> that's<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> new<00:01:23.189> coupler<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
coupler that's the new coupler here and

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.170 
coupler that's the new coupler here and
grab<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:26.630> that's<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.900> new<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.850> lot<00:01:29.850> beefier

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
grab it that's the new one lot beefier

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.600 
grab it that's the new one lot beefier
let<00:01:30.990> me<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> old<00:01:32.400> now

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
let me see I think I have the old now

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.890 
let me see I think I have the old now
here's<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.799> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> old<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.470> old<00:01:37.470> one

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
here's the this is the old the old one

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.090 
here's the this is the old the old one
kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> show<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> difference<00:01:40.860> there

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
kind of show you the difference there

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
kind of show you the difference there
and<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.030> pump<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:47.280> goes<00:01:47.430> from<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.729> 2-inch

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and on the pump it goes from a 2-inch

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.490 
and on the pump it goes from a 2-inch
and<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.450> believe<00:01:48.780> that's<00:01:48.990> two<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.710> quarter

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
and I believe that's two and a quarter

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
and I believe that's two and a quarter
really<00:01:52.500> no<00:01:52.649> modifications<00:01:53.520> necessary<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.329> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
really no modifications necessary but I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.899 
really no modifications necessary but I
figured<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.430> one's<00:01:56.430> got<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> little

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
figured that that one's got a little

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.120 
figured that that one's got a little
more<00:01:57.180> cushioning<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> larger<00:01:58.950> one

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
more cushioning and in the larger one

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.330 
more cushioning and in the larger one
it's<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> rubber<00:02:00.680> insert<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.860> instead<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
it's got a rubber insert in instead of a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's got a rubber insert in instead of a
hard<00:02:02.490> plastic<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.360> figure<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.990> will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hard plastic so I figure that that will

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.869 
hard plastic so I figure that that will
take<00:02:04.409> some<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> rumbling<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.110> also

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
take some of the rumbling out of it also

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.490 
take some of the rumbling out of it also
I've<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:08.940> some

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.270 

rubber<00:02:11.880> grommets<00:02:13.440> they're<00:02:14.440> real<00:02:14.740> hard<00:02:14.920> rubber

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
rubber grommets they're real hard rubber

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.860 
rubber grommets they're real hard rubber
grommets<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.180> gonna<00:02:16.360> go<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.630> between

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
grommets that are gonna go in between

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.210 
grommets that are gonna go in between
the<00:02:17.260> mounting<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.640> engine<00:02:19.450> base

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the mounting and the and the engine base

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.500 
the mounting and the and the engine base
so<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:23.410> will<00:02:23.680> help<00:02:24.250> cushion<00:02:24.580> some<00:02:25.390> of

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
so that that will help cushion some of

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.210 
so that that will help cushion some of
the<00:02:25.570> vibration<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:28.570> electric<00:02:29.050> start<00:02:29.380> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.530 

made<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.400> little<00:02:35.459> exhaust<00:02:36.459> pipe<00:02:36.760> because

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
made this little exhaust pipe because

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.140 
made this little exhaust pipe because
otherwise<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.530> would<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.830> going<00:02:39.670> right<00:02:39.850> into

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
otherwise it would be going right into

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.850 
otherwise it would be going right into
the<00:02:40.240> back<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> my<00:02:40.750> seat<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:43.330> turned<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.500> I'm

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
the back of my seat so I turned it I'm

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.790 
the back of my seat so I turned it I'm
gonna<00:02:45.100> probably<00:02:45.370> make<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.260> exhaust<00:02:47.260> pipe<00:02:47.530> that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
gonna probably make a exhaust pipe that

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.880 
gonna probably make a exhaust pipe that
goes<00:02:47.830> straight<00:02:48.220> up<00:02:49.200> cedar<00:02:50.200> Dadar<00:02:50.500> I'll<00:02:50.680> make

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
goes straight up cedar Dadar I'll make

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.610 
goes straight up cedar Dadar I'll make
one<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.370> comes<00:02:52.090> up<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:52.720> comes<00:02:53.200> around

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
one that comes up and then comes around

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.360 
one that comes up and then comes around
and<00:02:54.100> then<00:02:54.820> exhaust<00:02:55.360> towards<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.989> rear<00:02:56.380> so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and then exhaust towards the rear so

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.120 
and then exhaust towards the rear so
that's<00:02:57.760> what<00:02:57.940> we're<00:02:58.060> gonna<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.800> what<00:02:59.800> some

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's what we're gonna do what some

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
job I have to make a plate you see the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.130 
job I have to make a plate you see the
plate<00:03:57.850> there<00:03:58.090> cuz<00:03:58.239> I've<00:03:58.360> got<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.660> extend<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
plate there cuz I've got to extend the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.550 
plate there cuz I've got to extend the
bolt<00:03:59.320> holes<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.890> bolt<00:04:00.100> holes<00:04:00.340> are<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
bolt holes the bolt holes are for the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.410 
bolt holes the bolt holes are for the
other<00:04:02.680> inch<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.160> our<00:04:03.480> hour<00:04:04.480> centered<00:04:05.049> at<00:04:05.200> about

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
other inch in our hour centered at about

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.180 
other inch in our hour centered at about
10<00:04:07.420> inches<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.870> think<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.320> got<00:04:08.530> it<00:04:08.650> go<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.829> 12

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
10 inches I think I got it go to 12

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.190 
10 inches I think I got it go to 12
inches<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:09.640> that's<00:04:10.060> difference<00:04:10.660> okay

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
inches so that's difference okay

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.620 
inches so that's difference okay
talk<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.590> later
