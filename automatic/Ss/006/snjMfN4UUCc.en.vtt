00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
and easy and we're going to be using

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.190 
and easy and we're going to be using
like<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.550> most<00:00:27.849> expensive<00:00:28.090> spice<00:00:28.630> which<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.169> a

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
like the most expensive spice which is a

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.019 
like the most expensive spice which is a
saffron<00:00:29.770> that<00:00:29.980> comes<00:00:30.160> from<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.399> crocus<00:00:30.759> plant

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
saffron that comes from the crocus plant

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.069 
saffron that comes from the crocus plant
and<00:00:31.509> each<00:00:31.899> plant<00:00:32.200> has<00:00:32.259> three<00:00:32.680> little<00:00:34.079> stigmas

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
and each plant has three little stigmas

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.319 
and each plant has three little stigmas
and<00:00:35.350> they're<00:00:36.309> actually<00:00:36.700> hand-picked<00:00:37.149> and

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
and they're actually hand-picked and

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.549 
and they're actually hand-picked and
that's<00:00:37.540> why<00:00:37.660> it<00:00:37.720> makes<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:38.110> make<00:00:38.290> it<00:00:38.440> so

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
that's why it makes it make it so

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's why it makes it make it so
expensive<00:00:38.950> and<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:40.090> trick<00:00:40.329> about<00:00:40.449> the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
expensive and the trick about the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.810

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.160 
take each branch off like as such but
because<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.880> takes<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.270> long<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> do<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
because it takes so long to do that the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
because it takes so long to do that the
best<00:02:31.380> way<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> found<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.550> lay<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
best way I found to do it is just lay it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.940 
best way I found to do it is just lay it
right<00:02:32.850> into<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.300> pan<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.500> cooks<00:02:34.739> it's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
right into the pan and as it cooks it's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.970 
right into the pan and as it cooks it's
all<00:02:35.040> gonna<00:02:35.220> come<00:02:35.489> off<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.959> stem<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.709> can

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
all gonna come off the stem and you can

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.280 
all gonna come off the stem and you can
just<00:02:38.130> pull<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.370> out<00:02:38.519> later<00:02:38.959> when<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.140> all

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
just pull it out later when it's all

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:55.280 
just pull it out later when it's all
done<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.500> we'll<00:02:49.739> add<00:02:49.920> our<00:02:49.950> rice<00:02:54.290> this

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
we're going to use a little bit of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.030 
we're going to use a little bit of
tomato<00:03:10.260> paste<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:13.410> other<00:03:13.590> thing<00:03:13.860> too

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
which I found about this recipe is the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.250 
which I found about this recipe is the
more<00:03:19.709> oil<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:20.040> add<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.420> more<00:03:21.630> richer

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
more oil you add to it the more richer

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.040 
more oil you add to it the more richer
and<00:03:22.410> more<00:03:22.800> flavorful<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.519> actually<00:03:24.000> becomes

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.450 

and<00:03:29.050> we'll<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.260> kind<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.680> saute<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.280> up

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
and we'll just kind of saute that up

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.890 
and we'll just kind of saute that up
make<00:03:30.670> sure<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.150> rice<00:03:31.330> is<00:03:31.510> coated<00:03:31.720> with

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
make sure all the rice is coated with

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.190 
make sure all the rice is coated with
the<00:03:32.020> oil<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:37.630> we'll<00:03:37.840> just<00:03:38.020> add<00:03:38.170> our

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
the oil and to this we'll just add our

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:48.449 
the oil and to this we'll just add our
water<00:03:38.530> now

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459
