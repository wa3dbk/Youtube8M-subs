rising and ground zeroes is on last
generation<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.829> tiny<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
generation and it's kind of tiny but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970

let's<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.600> future<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.800> new

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
let's look to the future we have the new

let's look to the future we have the new
witcha<00:00:56.280> game<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.030> play<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:58.350> areas

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
witcha game and they play that two areas

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.639 
witcha game and they play that two areas
just<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.820> areas<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.480> their<00:01:00.660> massive<00:01:01.170> game<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just two areas of their massive game is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.710 
just two areas of their massive game is
gonna<00:01:01.800> be<00:01:01.949> 3.5<00:01:02.879> times<00:01:03.449> bigger<00:01:03.870> than<00:01:04.220> Skyrim<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
gonna be 3.5 times bigger than Skyrim a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
gonna be 3.5 times bigger than Skyrim a
ridiculously<00:01:06.720> big<00:01:07.320> motherfucking<00:01:08.189> size<00:01:08.549> but

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
ridiculously big motherfucking size but

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.840 
ridiculously big motherfucking size but
will<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.780> consists<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.530> barren<00:01:11.070> nothingness

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
will it consists of barren nothingness

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.840 
will it consists of barren nothingness
another<00:01:12.720> game<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:13.260> eagerly<00:01:13.740> anticipating<00:01:14.729> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
another game I'm eagerly anticipating is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.929 
another game I'm eagerly anticipating is
fallout<00:01:15.150> 4<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.500> necessarily<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
fallout 4 I don't necessarily want it to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
fallout 4 I don't necessarily want it to
be<00:01:18.119> bigger<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.840> more<00:01:19.080> interactive<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
be bigger just more interactive and a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
be bigger just more interactive and a
better<00:01:20.880> identity<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.049> new<00:01:22.229> areas<00:01:22.799> because

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
better identity for new areas because

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.520 
better identity for new areas because
sometimes<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:23.900> recycle<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.229> paste

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
sometimes they just recycle and we paste

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
sometimes they just recycle and we paste
the<00:01:25.710> fucking<00:01:26.100> subways<00:01:26.610> or<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.299> same<00:01:27.540> abandon

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the fucking subways or the same abandon

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.550 
the fucking subways or the same abandon
areas<00:01:28.740> copy<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.700> paste<00:01:29.790> style<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.900> wasn't

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
generation and I knew it was to do with

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
generation and I knew it was to do with
the<00:01:39.990> size<00:01:40.259> constraints<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> this
