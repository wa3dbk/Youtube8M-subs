00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
player there and Napoli player also I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
player there and Napoli player also I
can't<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.320> anyone<00:01:52.530> else<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.850> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
can't see anyone else know so that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
can't see anyone else know so that's
pretty<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.200> garden<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.649> leagues<00:01:55.860> he

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
pretty at this garden what leagues he

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
pretty at this garden what leagues he
and<00:01:56.250> Russian<00:01:56.969> league<00:01:57.180> he<00:01:57.450> probably<00:01:57.479> won't

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and Russian league he probably won't

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.170 
and Russian league he probably won't
sell<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.469> we'll<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.799> let<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.399> guard<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
sell so we'll just let this guard that I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.050 
sell so we'll just let this guard that I
move<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> 15k<00:02:01.649> pack<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.159> basically

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
move on to the 15k pack so basically

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.429 
move on to the 15k pack so basically
this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.420> last<00:02:03.600> chance<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.020> us<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
this is the last chance for us to get a

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.190 
this is the last chance for us to get a
blue<00:02:04.649> player<00:02:04.920> into<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> collection<00:02:06.509> book<00:02:06.869> the

only<00:02:07.439> other<00:02:07.469> way<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> for<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.520> rid<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
only other way is for at rid of a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
only other way is for at rid of a
duplicate<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> cannot<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
duplicate but I cannot see that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.850

hopefully pack a blue because I want a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.910 
hopefully pack a blue because I want a
blue<00:02:20.790> I've<00:02:21.060> never<00:02:21.270> packed<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.720> blue<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.110> 33

years<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.370> playing<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:23.640> game<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:25.380> still

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
years of playing this game and we still

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.700 
years of playing this game and we still
not<00:02:26.910> getting<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.240> AC<00:02:27.450> Milan<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.350> think

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
not getting on AC Milan that I think

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.890 
not getting on AC Milan that I think
that's<00:02:28.980> AC<00:02:29.520> Milan<00:02:29.820> complete<00:02:30.330> now<00:02:30.510> with<00:02:30.720> that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that's AC Milan complete now with that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.210 
that's AC Milan complete now with that
addition<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.500> materie<00:02:32.040> ball<00:02:32.970> there<00:02:33.950> will<00:02:34.950> list

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
addition of materie ball there will list

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.830 
addition of materie ball there will list
up<00:02:36.710> Newcastle<00:02:37.850> Janssen<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:39.690> them

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
up Newcastle Janssen and I think them

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.210 
up Newcastle Janssen and I think them
out<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.050> some<00:02:40.170> decent<00:02:40.530> duplicates<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.070> in

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
out with some decent duplicates and in

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
out with some decent duplicates and in
which<00:02:41.430> there<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.730> no<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.570> there<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.780> are

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
which there is no I like so there we are

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
which there is no I like so there we are
full<00:02:43.110> this<00:02:43.290> gap<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:43.890> completed<00:02:44.250> AC

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
full this gap but we have completed AC

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.600 
full this gap but we have completed AC
Milan<00:02:45.000> after<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.390> pull<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.800> hopefully<00:02:47.490> in

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Milan after that pull so hopefully in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.160
