on the island but that's about it for
the<00:00:51.480> story<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.379> could<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.739> been<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> great

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the story what could have been a great

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.400 
the story what could have been a great
narrative<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:54.300> doesn't<00:00:54.690> exist<00:00:54.780> outside<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
narrative just doesn't exist outside a

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.860 
narrative just doesn't exist outside a
few<00:00:55.679> intermissions<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.609> minor<00:00:56.909> set<00:00:57.300> pieces<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
few intermissions and minor set pieces I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
few intermissions and minor set pieces I
was<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.679> miffed<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.309> game<00:00:59.579> lets

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
was a little miffed at how the game lets

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.819 
was a little miffed at how the game lets
you<00:00:59.909> choose<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:00.390> final<00:01:00.809> mission<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.679> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you choose the final mission from the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.850 
you choose the final mission from the
word<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.909> that's<00:01:03.149> only<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.650> game

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
word go but that's only because the game

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
word go but that's only because the game
holds<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.730> no<00:01:05.909> story<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> first

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
holds little to no story in the first

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590 
holds little to no story in the first
place<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.980> I'm<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.190> little<00:01:08.430> tired<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
place now I'm a little tired of the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
place now I'm a little tired of the
typical<00:01:10.020> realistic<00:01:10.680> war<00:01:10.950> story<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> would

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
typical realistic war story but it would

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.340 
typical realistic war story but it would
have<00:01:12.210> been<00:01:12.360> nice<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.810> had<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> great

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
have been nice to have had a great

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.670 
have been nice to have had a great
futuristic<00:01:14.190> experience<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> story<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
futuristic experience as a story so in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
futuristic experience as a story so in
total<00:01:17.840> I<00:01:19.760> think<00:01:20.760> it's<00:01:20.970> unfair<00:01:21.480> to<00:01:21.540> score<00:01:22.050> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
total I think it's unfair to score this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.110 
total I think it's unfair to score this
section<00:01:22.620> as<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> game<00:01:23.100> clearly<00:01:23.670> knows<00:01:23.880> its

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
section as the game clearly knows its

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:35.120 
section as the game clearly knows its
content<00:01:24.660> is<00:01:24.870> all<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:26.010> multiplayer

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.350 

but<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.460> before<00:01:36.640> we<00:01:36.910> get<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
but just before we get to the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.420 
but just before we get to the
multiplayer<00:01:37.870> we've<00:01:38.710> got<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.040> look<00:01:39.190> at<00:01:39.310> this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
multiplayer we've got to look at this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.460 
multiplayer we've got to look at this
game<00:01:39.730> and<00:01:39.910> compare<00:01:40.540> it<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> other<00:01:40.780> games<00:01:41.260> of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
game and compare it to other games of

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.570 
game and compare it to other games of
its<00:01:41.770> genre<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:43.290> graphically<00:01:44.290> once<00:01:45.010> again<00:01:45.340> I'm

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
its genre and graphically once again I'm

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.340 
its genre and graphically once again I'm
surprised<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.180> even<00:01:46.480> the<00:01:46.540> graphics<00:01:46.990> behind

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
surprised that even the graphics behind

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.260 
surprised that even the graphics behind
this<00:01:47.470> game<00:01:47.740> they<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.550> look<00:01:48.700> incredibly

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
this game they just look incredibly

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.050 
this game they just look incredibly
simple<00:01:49.780> low<00:01:50.080> textured<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:50.800> dark<00:01:51.280> but<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
simple low textured and dark but I

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.850 
simple low textured and dark but I
wouldn't<00:01:52.540> say<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.870> visuals<00:01:53.290> of<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.650> game

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
wouldn't say the visuals of this game

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.980 
wouldn't say the visuals of this game
are<00:01:54.010> terrible<00:01:54.580> of<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:55.210> resultant<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.780> lot

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
are terrible of the resultant a lot

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.710 
are terrible of the resultant a lot
going<00:01:56.260> on<00:01:56.500> screen<00:01:56.979> at<00:01:57.190> one<00:01:57.490> time<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:58.479> much

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
going on screen at one time with much

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.000 
going on screen at one time with much
debris<00:01:59.140> which<00:01:59.830> makes<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.280> levels<00:02:00.610> stand<00:02:00.970> out

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
debris which makes the levels stand out

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.800 
debris which makes the levels stand out
there<00:02:03.010> are<00:02:03.190> times<00:02:03.490> when<00:02:03.820> design<00:02:04.210> does<00:02:04.540> touch

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
there are times when design does touch

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.050 
there are times when design does touch
upon<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.080> futuristic<00:02:05.890> element<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.760> is<00:02:06.910> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
upon a futuristic element that is the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.419 
upon a futuristic element that is the
ark<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.570> it's<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.110> very<00:02:08.320> cool<00:02:08.619> world<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
ark and it's a very cool world and the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.430 
ark and it's a very cool world and the
game<00:02:09.610> somewhat<00:02:09.970> conveys<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.330> struggle<00:02:11.080> that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
game somewhat conveys that struggle that

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.729 
game somewhat conveys that struggle that
the<00:02:11.620> people<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> island<00:02:12.310> are<00:02:12.610> facing

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.170 

online<00:02:17.739> maps<00:02:18.070> are<00:02:18.340> well<00:02:18.489> set<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:18.970> and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
online maps are well set out and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
online maps are well set out and
objectives<00:02:19.810> well<00:02:20.050> coordinated<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.520> think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
objectives well coordinated so I think

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.479 
objectives well coordinated so I think
