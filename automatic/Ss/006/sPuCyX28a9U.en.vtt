00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
in one left minute so there are a couple

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.380 
in one left minute so there are a couple
things<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.900> know<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.619> know<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> power<00:00:20.390> which

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
things we know we know the power which

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.080 
what's the intensity of the light one
meter<00:02:34.440> away<00:02:34.620> okay<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.490> one's<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.790> little<00:02:35.880> bit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
meter away okay this one's a little bit

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.720 
meter away okay this one's a little bit
trickier<00:02:36.480> because<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.490> power

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
trickier because I know what the power

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.720 
trickier because I know what the power
is<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:40.200> now<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.410> want<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> intensity<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.550> we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is but now I want the intensity and we

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.199 
is but now I want the intensity and we
remember<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:43.490> intensity<00:02:44.490> times<00:02:44.880> area

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
remember that that intensity times area

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.600 
remember that that intensity times area
is<00:02:45.390> equal<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> power<00:02:46.080> or<00:02:46.800> intensity<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.580> equal

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
is equal to power or intensity is equal

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.860 
is equal to power or intensity is equal
to<00:02:47.970> power<00:02:49.670> divided<00:02:50.670> by<00:02:50.700> area<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.390> let's<00:02:51.660> write

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
to power divided by area so let's write

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.479 
to power divided by area so let's write
that<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.110> because<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.709> want<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.040> intensity

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
that down because I want the intensity

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.090 
that down because I want the intensity
and<00:02:53.700> that's<00:02:53.850> equal<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.360> power<00:02:54.950> divided<00:02:55.950> by

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and that's equal to the power divided by

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.090 
and that's equal to the power divided by
the<00:02:56.160> area<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:57.380> let's<00:02:58.380> go<00:02:58.530> ahead<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.920> draw

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
the area and let's go ahead and draw

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
the area and let's go ahead and draw
ourselves<00:02:59.250> our<00:02:59.760> little<00:03:00.000> light<00:03:00.209> here<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:02.750> to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.560 
ourselves our little light here and to
calculate<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.410> area<00:03:04.800> I'm<00:03:05.340> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.730> assume<00:03:06.239> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
calculate the area I'm going to assume a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
sphere with a radius of one meter and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.380 
sphere with a radius of one meter and
that<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.080> know<00:03:13.830> what<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.459> area<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that I know what the area is because the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.110 
that I know what the area is because the
area<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> sphere<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:17.310> equal<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.970> four<00:03:18.630> PI<00:03:18.930> R

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
area of a sphere is equal to four PI R

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.690 
area of a sphere is equal to four PI R
squared<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.709> this<00:03:22.709> gives<00:03:22.980> me<00:03:23.100> everything<00:03:23.430> I

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
squared and this gives me everything I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
need the intensity is equal to one watt

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.420 
need the intensity is equal to one watt
let's<00:03:29.130> go<00:03:29.250> ahead<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.489> make<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.730> capital<00:03:30.180> W

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
let's go ahead and make that a capital W

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.100 
let's go ahead and make that a capital W
divided<00:03:32.430> by<00:03:32.459> four<00:03:33.030> PI<00:03:33.390> R<00:03:34.400> squared<00:03:36.110> meter

divided by four PI R squared meter

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.390 
divided by four PI R squared meter
squared<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.820> R's<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:40.620> easy<00:03:40.950> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
squared and R's one so that's easy so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.880

/ a hundred centimeters and squaring
that<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.910> that's<00:04:32.150> essentially<00:04:32.600> dividing

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
that and so that's essentially dividing

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.930

dividing by 10,000 so 8 times 10 to the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.470 
dividing by 10,000 so 8 times 10 to the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
minus 6 watts per centimeter squared so

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.000 
minus 6 watts per centimeter squared so
that's<00:04:59.630> how<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.900> see<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.500> convert<00:05:00.860> between

at 600 nanometers and 700 nanometers
well<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.440> think<00:05:12.620> this<00:05:12.740> might<00:05:12.920> be<00:05:12.980> an<00:05:13.190> easy

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
well you think this might be an easy

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.000 
well you think this might be an easy
problem<00:05:13.820> because<00:05:14.510> in<00:05:14.660> this<00:05:14.780> case<00:05:15.020> Delta<00:05:15.560> lamda

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
problem because in this case Delta lamda

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.650 
problem because in this case Delta lamda
is<00:05:16.430> equal<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:18.220> 100<00:05:19.220> nanometers<00:05:19.870> so<00:05:20.870> Delta<00:05:21.650> e<00:05:21.860> is

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
is equal to 100 nanometers so Delta e is

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.430 
is equal to 100 nanometers so Delta e is
simply<00:05:23.660> equal<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.470> HC<00:05:25.420> over<00:05:26.420> Delta<00:05:26.810> lamda<00:05:27.290> and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
simply equal to HC over Delta lamda and

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.710 
simply equal to HC over Delta lamda and
you<00:05:28.100> calculate<00:05:28.670> this<00:05:28.850> and<00:05:29.150> you're<00:05:29.480> going<00:05:29.660> to

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
you calculate this and you're going to

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.350 
you calculate this and you're going to
find<00:05:30.170> out<00:05:30.380> you're<00:05:30.590> completely<00:05:31.100> wrong<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.610> the

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
find out you're completely wrong and the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.500 
find out you're completely wrong and the
reason<00:05:32.720> for<00:05:32.750> this<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.350> that<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:34.610> energy<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.060> HC

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
reason for this is that the energy is HC

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.420 
reason for this is that the energy is HC
divided<00:05:35.900> by<00:05:36.050> lambda<00:05:36.230> and<00:05:36.590> if<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.950> look<00:05:37.160> at<00:05:37.280> the

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
divided by lambda and if you look at the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.760 
divided by lambda and if you look at the
curve<00:05:37.640> of<00:05:37.880> 1<00:05:38.030> over<00:05:38.300> lambda<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:39.200> find<00:05:39.440> it's<00:05:39.620> not

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
curve of 1 over lambda you find it's not

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.740 
curve of 1 over lambda you find it's not
a<00:05:39.830> straight<00:05:40.250> line<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.940> you<00:05:41.030> can't<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.540> this

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
a straight line so you can't do this

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.750 
a straight line so you can't do this
Delta<00:05:42.170> trick<00:05:42.380> anymore<00:05:42.590> essentially<00:05:43.550> what<00:05:43.670> you

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
Delta trick anymore essentially what you

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.030 
Delta trick anymore essentially what you
have<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.090> do<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.540> have<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.840> calculate<00:05:45.040> the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
have to do is you have to calculate the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.970 
have to do is you have to calculate the
energy<00:05:46.220> at<00:05:46.700> 600<00:05:47.270> nanometers<00:05:47.750> and<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.650> energy

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
energy at 600 nanometers and the energy

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.820 
energy at 600 nanometers and the energy
at<00:05:49.070> 700<00:05:49.610> nanometers<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.270> subtract<00:05:51.080> them<00:05:51.260> so

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
at 700 nanometers and subtract them so

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.700 
at 700 nanometers and subtract them so
the<00:05:52.010> real<00:05:52.220> energy<00:05:52.550> difference<00:05:53.090> Delta<00:05:53.510> e<00:05:53.710> is

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
the real energy difference Delta e is

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.450 
the real energy difference Delta e is
going<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.070> be<00:05:55.130> equal<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.670> HC<00:05:56.590> over<00:05:57.590> 600

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
going to be equal to HC over 600

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.020 
going to be equal to HC over 600
nanometers<00:05:59.590> realizing<00:06:00.590> that's<00:06:00.830> higher<00:06:01.130> minus

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
nanometers realizing that's higher minus

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.430 
nanometers realizing that's higher minus
HC<00:06:03.130> over<00:06:04.130> 700<00:06:04.670> nanometers<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.900> when<00:06:06.200> we<00:06:06.320> go

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
HC over 700 nanometers and when we go

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.630 
HC over 700 nanometers and when we go
ahead<00:06:06.560> and<00:06:06.800> do<00:06:06.920> this<00:06:07.100> we<00:06:07.280> should<00:06:07.490> get

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
ahead and do this we should get

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.550 
ahead and do this we should get
something<00:06:08.060> on<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.300> order<00:06:08.420> of<00:06:08.570> something<00:06:09.410> like

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
something on the order of something like

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.190 
something on the order of something like
a<00:06:09.620> point<00:06:10.430> four<00:06:10.760> electron<00:06:11.300> volts<00:06:11.690> which<00:06:12.050> I'm

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
a point four electron volts which I'm

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.600 
a point four electron volts which I'm
getting<00:06:12.350> just<00:06:12.560> by<00:06:12.740> reading<00:06:12.980> the<00:06:13.220> vertical

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
getting just by reading the vertical

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.370 
getting just by reading the vertical
distance<00:06:13.910> Delta<00:06:14.330> e<00:06:14.480> off<00:06:14.630> of<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.900> graph<00:06:15.110> there

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
distance Delta e off of the graph there

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.250 
distance Delta e off of the graph there
so<00:06:16.100> one<00:06:16.340> trick<00:06:16.520> people<00:06:16.820> fall<00:06:17.210> into<00:06:17.900> all<00:06:18.080> the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
so one trick people fall into all the

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.770 
so one trick people fall into all the
time<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:18.800> that<00:06:19.430> because<00:06:19.790> it's<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.150> 1<00:06:20.420> over

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
time is that because it's a 1 over

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.380 
time is that because it's a 1 over
lambda<00:06:21.710> curve<00:06:22.160> not<00:06:22.490> proportional<00:06:23.150> to<00:06:23.270> lambda

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
lambda curve not proportional to lambda

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.030 
lambda curve not proportional to lambda
you<00:06:24.020> can't<00:06:24.260> take<00:06:24.470> the<00:06:24.590> difference<00:06:24.920> and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
you can't take the difference and

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.250 
you can't take the difference and
calculate<00:06:25.550> the<00:06:25.640> energies<00:06:26.030> and<00:06:26.270> and<00:06:26.510> this<00:06:27.050> is<00:06:27.110> a

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
calculate the energies and and this is a

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.470 
calculate the energies and and this is a
fairly<00:06:27.920> common<00:06:28.250> mistake<00:06:28.700> you<00:06:28.880> have<00:06:29.030> to<00:06:29.060> do<00:06:29.330> it

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
fairly common mistake you have to do it

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.170 
fairly common mistake you have to do it
by<00:06:29.630> subtracting<00:06:30.290> the<00:06:30.380> two<00:06:30.530> energies<00:06:30.890> and<00:06:31.430> that

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
by subtracting the two energies and that

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.060 
by subtracting the two energies and that
