the moment if the season want to end

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.429 
the moment if the season want to end
Portland<00:01:34.259> would<00:01:34.409> miss<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.689> game<00:01:36.689> which

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
Portland would miss it by one game which

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
Portland would miss it by one game which
means<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.920> could<00:01:38.070> change<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> day<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.299> two<00:01:39.570> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
means it could change in a day or two in

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.920 
means it could change in a day or two in
a<00:01:39.810> game<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.400> they're<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.820> game<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.450> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a game or two so they're one game out of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:53.050 
a game or two so they're one game out of
playoff<00:01:43.710> contention<00:01:44.430> behind<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.960> Clippers<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060
