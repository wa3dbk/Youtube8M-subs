I've seen people embark on exercise and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.300 
I've seen people embark on exercise and
diet<00:00:21.150> programs<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.840> enthusiasm<00:00:22.439> only<00:00:23.160> to

why<00:00:25.769> does<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> happen<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.699> think<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> when

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
why does this happen I think that when

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.269 
why does this happen I think that when
most<00:00:27.779> people<00:00:28.230> push<00:00:28.470> themselves<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> their

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
physical comfort zone they expect an

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.920 
physical comfort zone they expect an
immediate<00:00:31.590> return<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.610> their<00:00:32.730> efforts<00:00:33.149> people

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
immediate return on their efforts people

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.420 
immediate return on their efforts people
are<00:00:34.020> willing<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> go<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.530> great<00:00:34.950> lengths<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
are willing to go to great lengths to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
are willing to go to great lengths to
look<00:00:35.670> better<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.059> feel<00:00:36.120> better<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.320> few

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
look better and feel better but very few

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.590 
look better and feel better but very few
continue<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.399> their<00:00:38.550> sacrifice<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.450> they

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
continue with their sacrifice if they

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 
continue with their sacrifice if they
don't<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.260> immediate<00:00:40.829> results<00:00:41.000> the<00:00:42.000> problem

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
don't see immediate results the problem

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.299 
don't see immediate results the problem
is<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> often<00:00:43.320> there's<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> lag<00:00:43.800> between<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
is that often there's a lag between the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
is that often there's a lag between the
time<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.969> start<00:00:45.300> with<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.719> exercise

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
time that you start with your exercise

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.200

program and when you actually begin
seeing<00:00:48.660> results<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.010> because<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
seeing results this is because the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
seeing results this is because the
changes<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.149> place<00:00:51.210> during<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> first
