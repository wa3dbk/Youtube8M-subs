water<00:01:19.830> directly<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.330> use<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
water directly and I like to use the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
water directly and I like to use the
direct<00:01:22.229> method<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:23.009> gem<00:01:23.220> elixirs<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> I'm

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
direct method for gem elixirs that I'm

direct method for gem elixirs that I'm
going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.299> ingest<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.500> an<00:01:25.650> indirect

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
going to ingest there is an indirect

method<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.939> I've<00:01:27.360> always<00:01:27.630> noticed<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
method but I've always noticed that the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.060 
method but I've always noticed that the
one<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> works<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.909> best<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.650> direct<00:01:31.650> method

it<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.450> be<00:03:37.599> yet<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:37.810> want<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.169> get<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> system<00:03:38.709> that

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
it to be yet I want to get a system that

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.970 
it to be yet I want to get a system that
pulls<00:03:39.790> out<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.480> chlorine<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.500> fluoride

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
pulls out the chlorine and the fluoride

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.720 
pulls out the chlorine and the fluoride
that<00:03:42.250> our<00:03:42.599> municipality<00:03:43.599> adds<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.139> our<00:03:44.200> water

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
that our municipality adds to our water

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.250 
that our municipality adds to our water
and<00:03:45.730> I'm<00:03:45.970> looking<00:03:46.299> for<00:03:46.450> systems<00:03:46.840> where<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.079> can

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
and I'm looking for systems where I can

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.670 
and I'm looking for systems where I can
add<00:03:47.410> crystals<00:03:47.980> to<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.280> systems<00:03:48.849> themselves

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
add crystals to the systems themselves

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.680 
add crystals to the systems themselves
to<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.799> filtration<00:03:51.299> so<00:03:52.299> I'm<00:03:52.389> going<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.569> be

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
to the filtration so I'm going to be

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.930 
to the filtration so I'm going to be
putting<00:03:52.900> like<00:03:53.109> quartz<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.709> amethyst

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
putting like quartz and amethyst

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.120 
putting like quartz and amethyst
maybe<00:03:55.540> lodestone<00:03:56.349> I'm<00:03:56.620> doing<00:03:56.889> some<00:03:57.099> research

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
maybe lodestone I'm doing some research

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.759 
maybe lodestone I'm doing some research
on<00:03:57.669> that<00:03:57.790> with<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> oxidation<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:59.079> okay<00:03:59.650> I'm

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
on that with the oxidation but okay I'm

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.099 
on that with the oxidation but okay I'm
totally<00:03:59.980> getting<00:04:00.250> off<00:04:00.489> topic<00:04:00.790> here<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.690> I'm

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
totally getting off topic here and I'm

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.140 
totally getting off topic here and I'm
just<00:04:02.169> that's<00:04:02.980> my<00:04:03.220> deal<00:04:03.579> geek<00:04:03.849> mine<00:04:04.090> flowing<00:04:04.660> so

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
and I'm gonna put the water in and I'm

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640 
and I'm gonna put the water in and I'm
just<00:04:14.730> going<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.090> let<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:16.019> sit<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
just going to let this sit and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.440 
just going to let this sit and
restructure<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.609> then<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:17.970> put<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.329> the
