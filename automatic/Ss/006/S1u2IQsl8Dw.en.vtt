00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.240
 seba is one of the most popular 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.820
 sport fishing from the Netherlands fish themselves 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.279
 hail and became small to me 100,000 members 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.080
 sport fishermen but also professional fishermen 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.000
 fish on the sea bass with nets along the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.320
 Dutch coast along the French coast 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.169
 english coast 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 not so nice story sea bass is already 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.050
 structurally overfished for years 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.730
 in the meantime, that sea ​​stands true 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.530
 under pressure 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.480
 does not look good therefore there are 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.739
 today in the hague to see what's going on 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.930
 can be done and we will 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.030
 sail and fred lead president of the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.629
 european english alliance 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.059
 Fred the afternoon Fred 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.460
 what is the problem problem is that it 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.679
 with the sea bass the files go wrong 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.410
 is collapsing right now 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.420
 europe proposes emergency measures and they 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.499
 ultimately want us to be short 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.679
 period 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.429
 60 to 80% less sea ​​bass from the victory 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.499
 withdraw from it 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.610
 that's how bad the sea bass is 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.500
 tell you briefly what is there 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.920
 actually the cause or causes of 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.229
 We have a very strong 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.580
 commercial fishing for sea bass too 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.640
 in the winter areas so where 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 sea ​​bass byte the net with nets and with 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.000
 with with per trolls as it is called 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.500
 have two ships my big net the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.450
 in between they go on winter areas 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.370
 do they go fishing then they also have the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.590
 recreational fish we have accessories 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.870
 and we tap 25% of all 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.070
 sea ​​bass in europe what we what and what goes 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.440
 what is going to happen 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.170
 well we as european sport fishermen 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.540
 dna we think of a three measures 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 increase the minimum 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.730
 size you can take with you so now I am 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.650
 on wild neon top 36 centimeters 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.090
 the State Secretary is thinking of 42 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.370
 centimeters but maybe he still has to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
 higher to save the sea ​​where they are 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.720
 The second measure is to stop the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.240
 fishing commercial fishing on the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.220
 winter areas where the zebra sprite 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.500
 and a third measure is a maximum 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.420
 several kilos of fish per month which 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.280
 can be landed by a fishery 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.050
 ship we are already there then 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.760
 no i look we are talking about short now 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.769
 term but ultimately will for the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.349
 longer-term sustainable solutions 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.000
 must have for those sea bass and leave 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.010
 we say 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.590
 approach to commercial fishing 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.210
 far too unclear to us 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.950
 Maasvlakte Europort area most important 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.410
 7 is region of the Netherlands annually 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.850
 believes 200,000 anglers out there 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.800
 come fishing there too 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.000
 miles of nets that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.560
 yes there may be what can I do 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.209
 expect as a sea ​​bass fisher like it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 is about that neat 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.220
 Southwest Netherlands sport fishing 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.350
 Cooperation with us are working towards 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.730
 the ministry of ez who who who who 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.830
 neat permits including one 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.330
 issued a new waterway 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 we have objected to this 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.830
 and where we say we are now waiting for one 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.060
 op op op op op ez 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.530
 and we continue with it because we 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.290
 think that they are just not allowed 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.239
 and that they have to leave 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 which way it goes it goes it 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.950
 in your opinion it's hard to say 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.620
 it is a tough file on the european 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.680
 level many interests but as everyone else 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.380
 behind which stands for sea bass to 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 have it restored than chlorine 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.890
 light on the horizon both for us but 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.180
 in the end of course for those you 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.590
 zebras 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.090
 increase the new size for 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.989
 sea ​​bass from 36 to 42 centimeters 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.220
 complete closure of the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.530
 professional fishing 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.420
 on the pipe hundreds of pairs of areas and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.700
 the maximum number of kilos to be supplied 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.530
 sea ​​bass per day per boat are none 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.540
 nasty measures but the state 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.560
 want more on the roll for the future 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.030
 read that quietly 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.180
 then visit the sport fishing website 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.180
