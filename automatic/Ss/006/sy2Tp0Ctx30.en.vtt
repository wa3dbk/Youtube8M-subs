my belief the most obvious way is to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
vicinity of trees generate belief

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.419 
vicinity of trees generate belief
quicker<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.020> doesn't<00:01:46.350> increase<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.189> maximum

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
quicker it doesn't increase the maximum

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.730

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
belief will be generated a lot quicker

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
belief will be generated a lot quicker
than<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:52.009> abode<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.219> doesn't<00:01:53.429> have<00:01:53.520> any

plant trees around those that you've

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.949 
plant trees around those that you've
already<00:02:05.960> constructed<00:02:07.030> as<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.299> can<00:02:08.450> see<00:02:08.690> here

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
already constructed as you can see here

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.580 
already constructed as you can see here
I've<00:02:09.259> created<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:10.160> farming<00:02:10.640> settlement<00:02:11.590> which

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
I've created a farming settlement which

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.339 
I've created a farming settlement which
was<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> merger<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.819> lots<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.750> individual

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
was a merger of lots of individual

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.410 
was a merger of lots of individual
abodes<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.220> settlement<00:02:16.549> will<00:02:17.440> produce

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
abodes and this settlement will produce

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.050 
abodes and this settlement will produce
1256<00:02:20.420> belief<00:02:20.810> in<00:02:21.049> total<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.459> more<00:02:22.819> than

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
1256 belief in total which is more than

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.320

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
produce 2,000 in total the difference

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.180 
produce 2,000 in total the difference
between<00:03:02.329> smaller<00:03:02.930> boughs<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.260> larger<00:03:03.859> abodes

between smaller boughs and larger abodes

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.789 
between smaller boughs and larger abodes
is<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> smaller<00:03:04.940> ones<00:03:05.410> produce<00:03:06.410> belief

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
is a smaller ones produce belief

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.770 
is a smaller ones produce belief
relatively<00:03:07.670> fast<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.120> they<00:03:08.239> fill<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.450> quickly

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
relatively fast so they fill up quickly

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.809 
relatively fast so they fill up quickly
so<00:03:09.139> they<00:03:09.349> need<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.650> harvested<00:03:10.250> more<00:03:10.459> often

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
so they need to be harvested more often

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.539 
so they need to be harvested more often
whereas<00:03:11.480> larger<00:03:11.900> abodes<00:03:12.290> fill<00:03:13.190> up<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.430> lot

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
whereas larger abodes fill up a lot

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.729 
whereas larger abodes fill up a lot
slower<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.630> they<00:03:14.840> need<00:03:15.019> harvest<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.500> every

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
slower so they need harvest in every

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.680 
slower so they need harvest in every
couple<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.099> hours<00:03:16.400> so<00:03:16.940> unless<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.359> play<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
couple of hours so unless you play the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.420 
couple of hours so unless you play the
game<00:03:17.870> every<00:03:18.169> five<00:03:18.410> or<00:03:18.620> ten<00:03:18.859> minutes<00:03:19.220> it's

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
game every five or ten minutes it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.979 
game every five or ten minutes it's
definitely<00:03:19.910> worthwhile<00:03:20.120> having<00:03:20.510> larger

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
definitely worthwhile having larger

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.110 
definitely worthwhile having larger
abodes<00:03:21.319> because<00:03:22.069> every<00:03:22.489> few<00:03:22.700> hours<00:03:22.730> when<00:03:23.060> you

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
abodes because every few hours when you

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.390 
abodes because every few hours when you
come<00:03:23.269> back<00:03:23.419> to<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.690> game<00:03:24.160> you're<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.310> to

come back to the game you're going to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.140 
come back to the game you're going to
have<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.579> lot<00:03:25.790> more<00:03:25.819> belief<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.989> harvest<00:03:28.150> also

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
have a lot more belief to harvest also
