sniper rifle one shot in the chamber not
really<00:00:12.420> bolt<00:00:12.630> action<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.200> guess<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.650> don't<00:00:13.860> even

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
really bolt action I guess I don't even

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.079 
really bolt action I guess I don't even
actually<00:00:14.190> no<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.549> called<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.759> guess<00:00:14.910> just<00:00:15.000> one

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
actually no it's called I guess just one

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.180 
actually no it's called I guess just one
in<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.360> chamber<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:15.900> pre<00:00:16.650> patches<00:00:17.070> well

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
in the chamber but pre patches well

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.980 
in the chamber but pre patches well
you'll<00:00:17.340> see<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> plus<00:00:17.760> 50<00:00:18.029> points<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.510> don't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
you'll see the plus 50 points I don't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
you'll see the plus 50 points I don't
really<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.070> worth<00:00:20.430> mentioning<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
really know if it's worth mentioning the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.820 
really know if it's worth mentioning the
fact<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.810> they're<00:00:22.080> pretty<00:00:22.260> patch<00:00:22.470> not<00:00:22.710> i'm

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
fact that they're pretty patch not i'm

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.500 
fact that they're pretty patch not i'm
sure<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.100> guys<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.400> notice<00:00:23.730> from<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
sure you guys would notice from the you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.720 
sure you guys would notice from the you
know<00:00:24.600> point<00:00:24.960> difference<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.619> some<00:00:26.340> guns<00:00:26.550> they

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
know point difference but some guns they

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.029 
know point difference but some guns they
did<00:00:26.910> actually<00:00:27.150> patch<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.410> worse<00:00:28.680> or

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
did actually patch and make worse or

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.519 
did actually patch and make worse or
make<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:29.460> excuse<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.810> DNA<00:00:31.230> i<00:00:31.260> got

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
make better excuse me so the DNA i got

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.900 
make better excuse me so the DNA i got
with<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.520> harder<00:00:32.790> than

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
with them was a little bit harder than

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.030 
with them was a little bit harder than
it<00:00:32.940> might<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:34.530> guess

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it might be to get one now so i guess

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
it might be to get one now so i guess
it's<00:00:35.219> worth<00:00:35.340> mentioning<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's worth mentioning but don't make a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
it's worth mentioning but don't make a
big<00:00:36.660> deal<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.230> anyway<00:00:37.590> Moore's<00:00:38.489> DNA<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
big deal out of it anyway Moore's DNA so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.299 
big deal out of it anyway Moore's DNA so
the<00:00:39.300> Moors<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.829> good<00:00:41.040> sniper

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the Moors is really really good sniper

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
the Moors is really really good sniper
rifle<00:00:41.700> um<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
rifle um it's it's basically the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.170 
rifle um it's it's basically the
equivalent<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> bold<00:00:44.610> action<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
equivalent of a bold action I know I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
equivalent of a bold action I know I
said<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> kind<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.590> shot<00:00:46.770> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
said that it's the kind of one shot in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.319 
said that it's the kind of one shot in
the<00:00:46.920> chamber<00:00:47.190> thing<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.820> works<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.300> same

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the chamber thing but it works the same

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
the chamber thing but it works the same
as<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.690> bolt<00:00:48.870> action<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.530> terms<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
as a bolt action you know in terms of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
as a bolt action you know in terms of
how<00:00:50.070> many<00:00:50.129> bullets<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> fire<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> minute

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
how many bullets you can fire a minute

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049 
how many bullets you can fire a minute
that<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.730> really<00:00:53.730> good<00:00:53.910> though

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059

either the Moors or the Atlas the one
thing<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> Atlas<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> can't

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
thing with the Atlas is that you can't

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
thing with the Atlas is that you can't
actually<00:01:02.670> hit<00:01:03.090> fire<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> only

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually hit fire with it and it only

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550 
actually hit fire with it and it only

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
imagining way back near the beginning of

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.880 
imagining way back near the beginning of
ghosts<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.950> believe<00:02:02.460> phase<00:02:02.790> put<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> VK

s kem strike where they edited it um so
it'd<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.940> it'd<00:02:09.119> be<00:02:09.420> pretty

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
it'd be kind of like that it'd be pretty

called<00:02:51.750> duties<00:02:52.080> kind<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.530> were<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.950> same

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
called duties kind of were all the same

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.800 
called duties kind of were all the same
you<00:02:53.220> know<00:02:53.370> because<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.940> feed<00:02:54.210> was<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.600> same

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
you know because the feed was the same

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.390 
you know because the feed was the same
way<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.380> everything<00:02:55.800> was<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.950> same<00:02:55.980> however

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
way and everything was the same however

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.490 
way and everything was the same however
in<00:02:56.700> advanced<00:02:57.060> warfare<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.570> feed<00:02:57.810> stays<00:02:58.200> up

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
in advanced warfare the feed stays up

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.820 
in advanced warfare the feed stays up
for<00:02:58.800> like<00:02:59.150> way<00:03:00.150> way<00:03:00.540> longer<00:03:00.990> than<00:03:01.140> normal<00:03:01.470> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
for like way way longer than normal and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.090 
for like way way longer than normal and
it's<00:03:02.820> kind<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.690> changed<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> standard<00:03:05.010> of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's kind of changed the standard of

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.250 
it's kind of changed the standard of
clips<00:03:05.400> uh<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.450> don't<00:03:06.540> know<00:03:06.750> if<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.020> good<00:03:07.230> or

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
clips uh I don't know if it's good or

of thing recently I've been just you
know<00:03:12.060> grinding<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:12.510> gameplays<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.870> all<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
know grinding for gameplays and all that

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.210 
know grinding for gameplays and all that
but<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.490> brings<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> question<00:03:16.040> whether<00:03:17.040> or

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but it brings the question whether or

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.580 
but it brings the question whether or
not<00:03:17.520> you<00:03:17.880> know<00:03:18.000> quad<00:03:18.300> feeds<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.870> five<00:03:19.140> ons<00:03:19.410> are

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
not you know quad feeds and five ons are

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.120 
not you know quad feeds and five ons are
good<00:03:19.920> anymore<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:21.030> mean<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:22.320> know<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.680> it's

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
good anymore I mean you know and it's

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.740 
good anymore I mean you know and it's
sort<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.790> goes<00:03:23.940> along<00:03:24.030> with<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.330> idea<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
sort of goes along with the idea that a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.900 
sort of goes along with the idea that a
lot<00:03:24.960> of<00:03:25.080> people<00:03:25.350> were<00:03:25.500> advocating<00:03:26.310> before

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
lot of people were advocating before

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.460 
lot of people were advocating before
advanced<00:03:27.180> warfare<00:03:27.450> which<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.380> know

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
advanced warfare which is that you know

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.250 
advanced warfare which is that you know
people<00:03:28.500> should<00:03:29.010> focus<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.610> not<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.960> feed

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
people should focus on not just the feed

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.740 
people should focus on not just the feed
and<00:03:31.290> more<00:03:31.770> like<00:03:32.010> how<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.310> clip<00:03:32.760> looks<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.450> how

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
and more like how the clip looks and how

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.350 
and more like how the clip looks and how
it<00:03:33.900> plays<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:34.740> of<00:03:34.800> thing<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
it plays in that kind of thing so the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.570 
it plays in that kind of thing so the
advanced<00:03:37.230> warfare<00:03:37.530> kind<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.010> did<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.310> by

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
advanced warfare kind of did that by

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.980 
advanced warfare kind of did that by
making<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.180> feet<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.420> little<00:03:39.570> bit<00:03:39.690> different

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
making the feet a little bit different

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.810 
making the feet a little bit different
and<00:03:40.050> last<00:03:40.230> longer<00:03:40.440> because<00:03:40.710> I<00:03:41.040> mean<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.340> regular

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
and last longer because I mean a regular

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.160 
and last longer because I mean a regular
quad<00:03:42.060> feed<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.360> know<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.720> take<00:03:42.840> 30

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
quad feed you know you can take 30

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.320 
quad feed you know you can take 30
seconds<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.220> four<00:03:44.610> kills<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.060> it'll<00:03:45.210> be<00:03:45.300> a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
seconds to get four kills and it'll be a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.270 
seconds to get four kills and it'll be a
quad<00:03:45.600> feed<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.080> no<00:03:46.530> one<00:03:46.620> else<00:03:46.650> gets<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.950> kill<00:03:47.160> so

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
quad feed if no one else gets a kill so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.420 
quad feed if no one else gets a kill so
that's<00:03:47.460> really<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.060> ridiculous<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.590> it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that's really really ridiculous so it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.370 
that's really really ridiculous so it's
it's<00:03:50.670> this<00:03:50.850> weird<00:03:51.090> balance<00:03:51.480> now<00:03:51.660> because<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
it's this weird balance now because the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.580 
it's this weird balance now because the
feed<00:03:52.620> still<00:03:52.920> does<00:03:53.220> matter<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:54.540> again<00:03:55.320> on<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
feed still does matter but again on the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.160 
feed still does matter but again on the
other<00:03:55.740> hand<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.390> clip<00:03:57.660> has<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.080> be

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
other hand it's like the clip has to be

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.800 
other hand it's like the clip has to be
entertaining<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:58.890> well<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.370> i<00:03:59.580> don't<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.600> i

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
entertaining as well so i don't know i

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.760 
entertaining as well so i don't know i
don't<00:04:00.870> know<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.350> good<00:04:01.470> thing<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:01.740> bad

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
don't know if it's a good thing or bad

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.990 
don't know if it's a good thing or bad
thing<00:04:01.890> i<00:04:02.130> think<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.520> good<00:04:02.670> thing<00:04:02.820> I

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
thing i think it's a good thing I

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.120 
thing i think it's a good thing I
haven't<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.720> been<00:04:04.230> watching<00:04:04.890> too<00:04:05.010> many

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
haven't really been watching too many

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.830 
haven't really been watching too many
