00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello everyone with you as always m m and that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.990
 dot py and in this review we'll talk about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.050
 the recently released new network shooter 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.699
 tactical intervention in one of ours 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.430
 commercials you may have seen and heard 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 mention of this project and now we 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's talk about it in more detail as far as 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 it might have gone so gameplay 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 tactical intervention let's be honest 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 originality is not different overall 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 the picture is very similar not only 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.399
 counter-strike me why tale hollows 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 due to different pop-ups suggest 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 tick as keyboard buttons visualization 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.120
 and proper mechanics at the moment 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.280
 There are several cards in the game and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.199
 game modes in principle these modes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 nothing new has long been making 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.309
 There are certainly some similar shooters 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.199
 elements of originality could protect 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.899
 beate persona or for the right to lead on 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
 car to the evacuation point but I assure you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.589
 is there a secondary task not 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.110
 is mandatory then all interest 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.369
 mode is lost and the game is already flowing into 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.300
 team deathmatch 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.880
 and race for frags 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.370
 as for the game mechanics itself all 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 pretty banal and poorly run 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.910
 fire back terrorists or control 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.980
 several successful targets hit 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.960
 various grenades are piled up in a row 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.630
 tactical ammunition and needless 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 Of course experience points and icons in every way 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.580
 from reaching in essence it's all but somehow 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.230
 magically play attract 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.120
 his naive attempt to bring something 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.490
 original and new and sometimes in 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.710
 principle it turns out there were rumors that 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.960
 tactical intervention should initially 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.880
 there was exactly counter-strike m2 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 but because of disagreements between geyb 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.720
 newell and mister just that 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.730
 recently forced to withdraw from gmail 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 counter-strike 2 never saw the light 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.050
 and instead we could contemplate 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 counter strike global offencive and even 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.780
 from ks go we can observe some 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.460
 large ketchup tactical intervention 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.860
 joy and fun are modes with 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.540
 hostages and wifi person 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 the release of hostages where they rush along 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 level with foaming at the mouth and a lot of panic 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.320
 fluid and when accompanied by VIPs to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.960
 evacuation points for the little ones themselves 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.830
 important is the main suitcase if sufferers 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.260
 still shoot 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.810
 no problem we pick up a suitcase and carry it 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.459
 the destination is even more enchanting 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.739
 steam carry vehicles 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.140
 yes yes you heard a lot of possible 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.000
 remember that in counter strike 1 6 in 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.280
 some handicraft cards 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.959
 machines were introduced remember how it was 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.670
 fun cut in a jeep by huge 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.420
 map and finally tactical 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.130
 intervention 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.850
 still gave us a race with 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.980
 gunfire sounds unreal cool but 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.380
 to the great and universal regret all 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.150
 not so cool if you thought that 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.080
 can drive and calmly without loss 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.450
 shoot down enemies 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.190
 then you are deeply mistaken cars 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.050
 managed like a cardboard box 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.030
 very sorry that you can not swear obscenities but 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.130
 say that physics is wretched machines 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 say nothing when you play on 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.390
 Highway map has the feeling that 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.880
 the game is in the earliest beta test 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.130
 car shakes from side to side all 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 pull tresetsya speed some not 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.630
 constantly then go to the exhausted 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 scurvy cow a second later the car 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.890
 turn on the warp engine well and then 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.660
 again on corolla events unfold 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.150
 lightning fast and coordinate their 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
 actions are almost unreal but not 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.000
 less generally it all looks very 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.010
 fun 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.990
 you can jump out of your car 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.820
 which is provided to you by default 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.930
 and change any other passing 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.480
 shooting off the horns 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.250
 playing as counter your task is to get away from 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.650
 chase out pursue their vip-persons 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.420
 suitcase at the evacuation point of terrorists 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.340
 all exactly the opposite you need to catch up 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.850
 guardians of the law and mercilessly of all 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.860
 to punish 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.380
 including vip person but as we said 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.360
 before, because a man is not so important than 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.630
 mysterious suitcase here such here 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.550
 cakes of innovations optional before 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.800
 fight footage can take this dog 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.140
 but it is exclusively on cards with so 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.550
 called the red tender dog match 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.680
 will help fight the cruel 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.020
 terrorists and bring a grenade to the owner 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.970
 Not without modern raisins 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.310
 any online shooter availability 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.260
 virtual store slaughter we get 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.630
 score and this points spend on purchase 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.280
 new equipment and weapons the most important thing 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.990
 that donat is not so evident and quite 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.120
 feel comfortable without buying 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.459
 perks for 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.350
 to buy yourself some gun or 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.240
 same dog get ready to spend in 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.250
 the game is not a couple of hours will have 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.169
 long and hard earn these points 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.930
 which by the way after the battle is not very 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.930
 generously pour in with regard to visualization 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.790
 graphics and sound i'm afraid it's all in 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.710
 tactical intervention is outdated 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.780
 the graphics on level fpd 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.610
 and in some places even worse 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.740
 sound effects are standard absolutely 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.500
 commonplace guys in a hurry 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.479
 release the game commemorated along with 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.669
 developers speak rather was 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.990
 cool idea get out great counter 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.210
 strike a new level 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.250
 to some extent he got it 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470
 but a bunch of bugs darken the usual 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.460
 and the gameplay it also would not hurt 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.620
 refresh a little 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.660
 no matter how sad it sounds but 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.560
 tactical intervention is little chance before 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.240
 other shooters 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.460
 especially when on the threshold 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.810
 battlefield 4 and others quite 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.669
 promising projects 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.430
 but still less tactical intervention 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.050
 will be popular but what 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.810
 already there the most popular 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.970
 servers are packed to capacity and in each 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.800
 More than 15 people participate in the game. 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.930
 and it already says that the game 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.310
 still tighten and even in spite 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.560
 an impressive amount of different 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.720
 defects we strongly advise you 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.400
 try tactical intervention and we 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680
 We will sincerely hope that soon 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.660
 this project will all go uphill with you 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.490
 was, as always, and mom job.ru 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.490
 all good mood and bye
