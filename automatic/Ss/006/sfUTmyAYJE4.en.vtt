00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.940
 so I just put it out of the bar 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.349
 I found a friend and had dinner with her. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.690
 still know the baby a little more yes 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.850
 and a little more than you are planning and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:26.010
 so the bandstand a bit drunk and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.449
 I went home and I was hungry 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.290
 I do not touch food 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.750
 I think this market 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 so I have nothing at home but we are 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 thinking about food and made a list 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.820
 of the lines 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 wow that exploded 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.410
 So I was saying that I made a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.790
 list of my favorite foods 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.420
 Brazil and I wanted to explain to you and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.520
 some things I do not like 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.689
 so I 'll start with some of the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.220
 Most Common Things in Brazil 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:26.840
 I really like the type of açaí cheese in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 bowl I love I also really like 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:39.829
 feijoada and poxinhas ours is potato 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.509
 fried chicken and cheese you do not like 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:47.299
 lots of pastels 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.310
 but how much the crayons 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:55.850
 I do not like it because you like to eat. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 A lot of fried food, I know, people. 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.060
 also very fond of tapioca type 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.570
 interesting is here when we talk 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.640
 about tapioca is something else but I like it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.670
 a lot of Brazilian tapioca and also 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.430
 picanha type the way you eat 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.180
 meat is a little different than we have 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 names different kinds of 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.550
 beef and I really like the style 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:33.540
 of eating meat and for the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.240
 dessert I also really like 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.030
 little kisses on the shoulder, right? 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.030
 I really like Brigadier 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:53.019
 more or less pet guy I do not love 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.900
 knows our state and for bbb and like 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.680
 lots of juice if you arrive in Brazil because 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.890
 You have many very expensive fruits and 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.610
 generally the prices are good for 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:12.400
 fruit is cheaper then here 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:16.000
 Our United States and Brazil, too. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.799
 like caipirinha type obviously 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.910
 most popular and traditional drink in 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.530
 Brazil, right? 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:30.239
 but I do not like Cachaca knows so much 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:37.900
 like a candy of cachaça is the river I think 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:43.329
 I prefer vodka or something else I drank 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.190
 a caipiroska and I liked it I found it tasty and 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.230
 also very interesting because you 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.350
 there are many foods that are very 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:58.540
 popular in Brazil that are a food 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:01.000
 from europe a food from japan and people 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.239
 Has a food having that of our states 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.910
 united but we have an interpretation 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:12.640
 different from the type food because it is very 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.560
 very Japanese for example were for 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:21.960
 United States and many went to Brazil 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.120
 but the way we designed it between 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.780
 sushi is a bit different 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.270
 This is for you more like a comet. 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:36.160
 mack né 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.560
 I taste great and also has no stroganoff 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:44.620
 nothing to do with the chopão but I think it is 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.449
 I do not know German, I do not know, but we have 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.720
 something in the united states that is called 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:52.270
 estrogonofe but if totally different 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.669
 does not have cream so does not have ketchup 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.680
 does not have potatoes like this but I like 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:06.400
 like the Brazilian version finds it very 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:09.880
 and you have not only 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.020
 type not the bible but also others 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:18.610
 procedures very common in Brazil. 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:21.130
 people have Lebanese food too. 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.880
 but it's a bit different 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.370
 I think when a food from another country 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.970
 Arrives in Brazil or arrives in the states. 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.710
 will change slightly because of the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.320
 local culture 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.169
 It is interesting to see this difference 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.510
 example with pizza 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.669
 You know the pizza we are on. 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.310
 It's different because you have pizza 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.820
 American type pizza radio is fine 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:54.340
 different from Brazilian pizza or pizza 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:57.930
 Italian is very tasty, very fond of 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.930
 eat brazilian food 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.039
 I think it's very delicious
