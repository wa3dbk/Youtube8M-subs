John Lee Hooker zeusie table we have a
chord<00:00:13.900> to<00:00:14.830> C<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.880> D<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:17.500> I<00:00:17.529> like<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:17.919> do<00:00:18.070> here

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
chord to C to D what I like to do here

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:26.190 
chord to C to D what I like to do here
is<00:00:18.369> I<00:00:18.580> play<00:00:19.000> a<00:00:19.029> little<00:00:19.180> melody<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:25.930> D

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
is I play a little melody on the D

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.319 
is I play a little melody on the D
string<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.559> the<00:00:26.860> g<00:00:26.890> string<00:00:27.309> against<00:00:27.849> that<00:00:28.000> a

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
string and the g string against that a

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.870 
string and the g string against that a
root<00:00:29.079> note<00:00:29.320> while<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:29.829> chords<00:00:30.250> are<00:00:30.369> changing

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
root note while the chords are changing

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:39.560 
root note while the chords are changing
under<00:00:31.149> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.670 

so<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.660> can<00:00:40.780> see<00:00:40.960> I'm<00:00:41.050> hybrid<00:00:41.500> picking

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
so you can see I'm hybrid picking

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.330 
so you can see I'm hybrid picking
because<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:43.390> pick<00:00:43.660> is<00:00:43.840> on<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.140> a-string<00:00:44.340> but

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
because the pick is on the a-string but

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.280 
because the pick is on the a-string but
I<00:00:45.610> use<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.030> finger<00:00:46.420> pick<00:00:46.629> on<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> D<00:00:47.050> in<00:00:47.170> the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
I use a finger pick on the D in the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:57.299 
I use a finger pick on the D in the
g-string<00:00:49.290> it's<00:00:50.290> good<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.620> do<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:50.769> little<00:00:51.070> bend

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.260 

so<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.620> even<00:01:00.190> picking<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.610> cord<00:01:00.910> I'm<00:01:01.090> using

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
so and even picking the cord I'm using

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:15.859 
so and even picking the cord I'm using
hi<00:01:01.510> everything

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.130 

so<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:16.979> lots<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> different<00:01:17.399> ways<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.359> add

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so there's lots of different ways to add

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.640 
so there's lots of different ways to add
a<00:01:19.350> fill<00:01:21.560> that's<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.920> way

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.740 

that's<00:01:30.400> another<00:01:30.700> way<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.210> those<00:01:34.390> fields<00:01:34.690> are

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that's another way so those fields are

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.679 
that's another way so those fields are
just<00:01:34.930> based<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.560> minor<00:01:35.860> pentatonic

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:51.539 

and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> second<00:01:42.429> half<00:01:42.640> of<00:01:42.789> it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.280 

so<00:01:52.060> sometimes<00:01:52.509> I'll<00:01:52.659> do<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.240 

so<00:01:57.290> that's<00:01:57.440> one<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.740> coolest<00:01:58.040> things

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
so that's one of the coolest things

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.820 
so that's one of the coolest things
about<00:01:58.340> having<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.090> do<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.450> 5<00:01:59.930> right<00:02:00.290> there<00:02:00.350> all

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
about having you do a 5 right there all

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.429 
about having you do a 5 right there all
those<00:02:01.070> lips

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.499 

and<00:02:06.679> on<00:02:07.189> a<00:02:07.219> boogie<00:02:07.490> tune<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:07.999> really<00:02:08.360> get

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
and on a boogie tune you can really get

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.949 
and on a boogie tune you can really get
away<00:02:08.629> with<00:02:08.929> anything<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.709> that

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.089 

so<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.080> good<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.260> experiment<00:02:19.950> with

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
so it's good to experiment with

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.460 
so it's good to experiment with
different<00:02:20.250> things

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.199 

or

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.290 

that's<00:02:29.810> everything
