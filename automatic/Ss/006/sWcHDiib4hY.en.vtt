00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.139
 hello, I say hello to one 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.350
 calvin we take care of that today 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.970
 theme in version what is an inversion 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.400
 normally the temperature decreases 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.320
 with the height off during an invasion 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.990
 the temperature increases with altitude and 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.060
 a very well known inversion starts 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.340
 the so-called ground in version the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.050
 arises in starry calm 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.020
 real since recently the temperature off 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.059
 you are here in the temperature profile 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.100
 the temperature rises here with the height 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.370
 and only starts at a certain height 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.500
 clearly off and a second in version 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.420
 sad is the so-called from sinks into 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.449
 version even at high pressure areas 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 you can find these dasing dry air 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.320
 from top to bottom warms up 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.360
 It is this area that is the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.879
 inversion here the temperature increases with 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.339
 the height to and only high up cool 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.440
 then the whole story starts again 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.549
 and a third invasion type is the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.100
 loan in version 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.080
 there is usually a warm front therefore 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.240
 and therefore takes even there 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.610
 temperature above a certain level 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.920
 us then again from how can be 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.990
 now we look at an inversion 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.859
 us at the bottom in version something 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.740
 more exactly 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.259
 the sun he heats or better 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.399
 said it heats the ground from below 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.829
 slowly 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.509
 this sometimes takes a few hours 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.850
 long the sun rises higher and higher 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.859
 At the same time you see on the animation 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.630
 that these mist slowly in the 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.060
 valleys to solve the problem is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.789
 however, that pollutants are down 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.530
 near the ground usually up to about 300 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.109
 400 meters high to rich and therefore 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.429
 air bad in winter and it forms 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.429
 often also smog smoother
