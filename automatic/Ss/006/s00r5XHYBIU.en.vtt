00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and shoot pretty long right well let's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.910 
and shoot pretty long right well let's
do<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> different<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:03.470> okay<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.830> going

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
do a different one okay so we're going

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.429 
do a different one okay so we're going
to<00:01:05.010> reload<00:01:05.250> again<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.180> second<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.900> hits<00:01:07.170> 1

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to reload again the second this hits 1

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.789 
to reload again the second this hits 1
i'm<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> quick<00:01:08.280> switch<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.799> reese

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
i'm going to quick switch this reese

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
timing the second it hits one you can

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.710 
timing the second it hits one you can
quick<00:01:22.740> switch<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> again<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.689> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
quick switch it and do it again now a

button on my mouse so that allows me to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
button on my mouse so that allows me to
quickly<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.460> shaves<00:01:32.939> over<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
quickly do this this shaves over a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
quickly do this this shaves over a
second<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> half<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:36.000> some
