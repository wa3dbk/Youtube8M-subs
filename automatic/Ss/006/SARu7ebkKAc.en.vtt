00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.670
 a good game we say like that it's 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 a by-product of a week of aces it's 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 true that reindeer will overtake on andreas 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.890
 holds alone andreas lebert admit but 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.530
 I was dry 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.960
 and still a lot of graphics and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 that the three characters cut off incarnate 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.260
 hopper finally we can then with one the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.909

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.590
 a good game town on it is change of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.740

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.800
 old kouba what like berck saplings 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.630
 triplets madness against beach to others 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.990

 frankly they were great what 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.000
 so in fact there I have the game there 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.130
 represents well anyway 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.900

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.670
 just a question that I wanted 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.600
 well posed to all those who are fans of 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:12.600
 the doublet wrc that actually in the game 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:17.460
 oh but wait for one in the game he puts 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:20.280
 two to new players so he puts 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.120
 Goldberg also is therefore what we can 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.490

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.790
