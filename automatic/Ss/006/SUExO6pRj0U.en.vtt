00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.139
 good afternoon to lunch 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.580
 my dear, I want to cook pea soup 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 this dish is healthy 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 simple recipe preparation 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.840
 included peas carrots onion salt pepper 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
 Bay leaf 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.609
 the court can be cooked on the basis of smoked 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 pork ribs on meat or chicken 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.349
 broth can be cooked with 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 sausage meatballs 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 with ham but I cook today with 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 pork 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.219
 mean the first before cooking soup 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 pea and you need to soak it 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.530
 esgaroth needs to be soaked in clean 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.559
 cold water wore 8 hours what I and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 did a pre-well 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.670
 rinse under running water to sort 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.879
 if there is a need 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 here and then the peas are rinsed again and clean 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.019
 cold water and put to cook something 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.020
 I, too, have made 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.460
 so that peas cooked faster you can 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 add a little soda to the aquarium 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 pea soup while peas cooked 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 I made a toast of what to do 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 callous little white frogs and I cut 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.790
 on small cubes and in oven 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.799
 I dry up to such a light color here 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 and not to such a bit like 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.650
 beige color is yellow 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 I did this squirrels then I did 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920
 fry 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.729
 badges and did fry why would 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
 cook today 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.890
 pea pork soup was on you 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.750
 a piece of pork I cut it fried 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 there added onions along with onions already 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.380
 overdoes pieces of pork and plus more 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.049
 added a carrot and that's it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.840
 I got the problem so though 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.119
 I prepared that I have prepared means 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.950
 I also cook potatoes separately I do not currencies 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.099
 in broth 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.129
 I did cook potatoes separately here I 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.000
 I have already cooked potatoes 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.150
 broke up 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.709
 I mash potatoes here and now 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:24.360
 to introduce all of these ingredients will be administered 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:25.140
 water so in boiling water here pan 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 water boils 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.370
 boiling water I put like this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.310
 called 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.819
 mashed potatoes for this potato but in 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.069
 this water a principle I was catching potatoes 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.930
 here I have this pot 3 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.950
 potatoes I put such here are average 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:56.900
 potato- sized snack to 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:03:01.620
 festive then good so then 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.829
 pea this player who I am also him 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.190
 separately cooked penny 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.880
 all the water boils away and as it were 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.989
 but I put the peas and the water is not very pouring 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.850
 much so that the bedspread 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.370
 not here, he basically fell apart a little 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.190
 because there were no more prisons 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:37.889
 it turned out and put it in the pot too 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:40.769
 the peas are now some water boils with water 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.410
 peas and potatoes boil now 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.370
 mean i'm first i'm first now 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.370

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.650
 I put some salt now I have 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.980
 It is such a little thing it is for brewing tea but 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.510
 I'm putting this little thing in a dungeon 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.430
 I will now show fragrant leaves 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.220
 pepper such pepper peas 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:10.950
 that's why i do it and then 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:15.290
 add spices right here and then 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.290
 same time so they don't swim later 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:26.820
 in the soup and put this one now I take away 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:30.580
 burning the handle on the tetis meat onion and 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:34.000
 carrot so it I posed as 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.430
 pieces of meat, I probably also diced 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.500
 have it all already done and this place 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.160
 fully prepared on how I would like to 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.980
 stubbed it along with vegetables 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.050
 I want to show everything to Grishina 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.050
 all this is a beautiful convention beautiful such 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.060
 what else am I taking here 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:03.940
 I'll come here now and put a bay 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:12.390
 leaf and i love red bitter pepper 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:17.410
 I'll add it here too red bitter 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:22.500
 cut into pieces and add will do 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:25.120
 less it less let it boil 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.280
 Well, that's how the boil broth minutes 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.080
 ten no more but already the principle 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.210
 all the individual have any kind of ready there 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.450
 potatoes all cooked well for a 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.220
 a little bit as if you are too lazy that I want 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.360
 say and want to say that in order 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.830
 so after the soup 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.440
 avoid the unpleasantness 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.690
 intestines and reduce processes 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.110
 gas formation is desirable to add 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.000
 a lot of dill here I let dill 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.370
 add a lot a lot add 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.830
 dill and it really helps 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.890
 and what else is very necessary peas 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.590
 wash me thoroughly i also wash it my 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.230
 before dunk under this and Alan 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.720
 Cops I was coming 8 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.890
 9 hours I wash it again thoroughly 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.190
 asking for washing 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.590
 and of course after we ate 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:18.820
 do not drink cold pea soup 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.510
 immediately here and here so here unpleasant 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.510
 phenomena will 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.070
 the very last thing i put dill 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:32.130
 here's dill i put them really 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.789
 a lot here and he has a year to pour there 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.690
 with soup 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.560
 and twenty minutes later I can already 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.240
 pour in a plate and we'll eat 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.940
 these spices are not the same spices 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.970
 let the weather go there I want to show 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:51.539
 that's how beautiful we are to tame us 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:54.240
 under the pieces of meat small pieces 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:58.789
 who roasted and want to tell you that 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.789
 the court is very, very tasty 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.490
 so on top 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.490
 I put the press glasses
