00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 I here imagined how in the company of Matt Cats come up with new headphones 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.070
 it means that in short we mutim the design of your favorite Fiver aha style and it’s necessary with all 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
 platforms without drivers need exactly and with graves 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.140
 and the microphone will not be seen stupidly hide we add vibrations to the bass and yes to dress 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.999
 they will be the other way around because it’s all there 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.310
 headphones mark mc phreak 4d design and true in their favorite 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.590
 style but what is even more strange dress and the opposite is true, it would seem 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.300
 fuck people have the ears look the other way it can not be comfortable and so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 no less it is convenient, I do not know how and why, but since they are much more comfortable to sit 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.519
 visible on the head dudes from bts something there at home 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.929
 In America, they know the metal frame and everything else is plastic to reduce 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.789
 weights I think it is right no matter how reliable the headphones are if they are heavy 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.679
 then sit in them for a long time does not work as well as 4 dani fluffs such an approach 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.090
 It won't be superfluous how much I can sit in them for about two hours and three without 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.370
 I sow the problems and then they begin to crush other people say that less 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.110
 The headband and ear cushions keep their shape soft, but it is clear that the ear is completely 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 fits into the bowl and to increase noise insulation made such ear cushions bowls 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.410
 swivel to make it easier to wear around your neck from external noise they cut off 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.910
 as soon as the music begins to play but no one will hide from your music 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.390
 control everything on the headphones the volume is the microphone button here 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.340
 equalizer button it has three modes for games with enhanced bases for 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 conversations with boosted mid frequencies and for music 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.140
 here the sound becomes balanced and more natural the most interesting 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.260
 button button enable vevita 4d function it adds vibration to the pool like 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.970
 just push this button the sound is transformed the vibration gives a very 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.750
 cool effect in games and movies feeling so cool that this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.220
 I don't want to turn off the thing if you like electronic music then I think you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.300
 I also like it, but for the rest of the music genres I think this function will be wrong 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.790
 well the microphone is built into the right bowl it does not move into space does not look so 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.950
 that you can safely walk in them along the street though with such a design, in my opinion, do not care 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.850
 you can see it or not he himself perfectly captures the voice but the problem is that 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.080
 he is omnidirectional so if at the other end of the room they are talking or don't let 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.420
 god tv your teammates will curse you not deprived of these headphones and 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.769
 mobility bundled second wire with a volume slider and a receive button 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.120
 calls with these headphones you want to play something big and cool 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.860
 where so many explosions clanging metals and so on is a good option to chop into 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.989
 Battle or Titanfall and other games sound no worse, but I think you understand that 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.220
 I wanted to say the way, besides the white and black colors, there is also a special version 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.650
 branded under titanfall looks cooler than usual in short if not 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.030
 a design that is not casual if it were not for the price which is also not 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.459
 the little headphones showed themselves very, very vigorously in games and movies, just 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.140
 nyashka do not want to shoot other than that in them and you can talk and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.430
 music to listen to everything for this is very cool that you do not need any 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.900
 drivers by connecting to yusb and everything works with all platforms 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.060
 in general, cool with it all with you was the online store of photos of him and me
