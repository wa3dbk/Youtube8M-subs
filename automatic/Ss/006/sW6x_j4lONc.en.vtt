but I really i'm thinking about maybe in
the<00:04:31.520> future<00:04:31.850> getting<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.420> completion<00:04:32.930> escape

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
the future getting a completion escape

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.290 
the future getting a completion escape
on<00:04:33.350> that<00:04:33.620> account<00:04:33.980> after<00:04:34.250> imax<00:04:34.760> obviously

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
on that account after imax obviously

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.690 
on that account after imax obviously
only<00:04:36.080> reason<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.800> open<00:04:36.950> up<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.340> few<00:04:37.520> more
