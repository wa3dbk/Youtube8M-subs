as you can see drink bottle is directly
in<00:02:36.650> line<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:36.980> my<00:02:37.100> gun<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.840> dart<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.380> directly

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
in line with my gun the dart is directly

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.680 
in line with my gun the dart is directly
in<00:02:40.070> line<00:02:40.100> with<00:02:40.340> my<00:02:40.489> gun<00:02:40.700> there's<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.540> back

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
in line with my gun there's to the back

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.020 
in line with my gun there's to the back
wheel<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.989> that<00:02:42.140> vehicle<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.739> that's<00:02:43.550> more

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
wheel of that vehicle and that's more

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.610 
wheel of that vehicle and that's more
closer<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.660> front<00:02:44.900> wheel<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> vehicle

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
closer to the front wheel of the vehicle

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.699 
closer to the front wheel of the vehicle
so<00:02:45.709> I'll<00:02:45.800> show<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:51.290> that's<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
so I'll show you in one so that's the

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.860 
so I'll show you in one so that's the
dot<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.160> measure<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.450> angle

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
dot there measure it up on the angle

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.560 
dot there measure it up on the angle
struggie<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> straight<00:02:55.130> will<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.030> across

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
struggie the straight will be across

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.320 
struggie the straight will be across
there<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:58.130> know<00:02:58.220> if<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.550> measure<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.150> I'm

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
there you know if I measure that it I'm

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.400 
there you know if I measure that it I'm
gonna<00:02:59.510> pick<00:02:59.660> up<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.870> dart<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.870> know<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.140> can't

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
gonna pick up the dart you know I can't

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.900 
gonna pick up the dart you know I can't
exactly<00:03:03.680> jump<00:03:04.160> straight<00:03:04.400> over<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.700> car

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
exactly jump straight over the car

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.310 
exactly jump straight over the car
obviously<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.630> I'll<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.840> take<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.110> same

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
obviously so I'll just take the same

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.190 
obviously so I'll just take the same
angle<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.800> other<00:03:06.830> side<00:03:07.100> of<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.280> car<00:03:08.200> where

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
angle on the other side of the car where

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.370 
angle on the other side of the car where
should<00:03:09.320> be<00:03:09.470> about<00:03:09.680> here<00:03:10.540> yep<00:03:11.570> been<00:03:12.110> turning

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
should be about here yep been turning

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.810 
should be about here yep been turning
around<00:03:13.810> one<00:03:14.810> two<00:03:15.410> three<00:03:16.070> back<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.489> one<00:03:16.640> with

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
around one two three back in one with

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.270 
around one two three back in one with
the<00:03:16.880> drink<00:03:17.060> bottle<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:18.070> and<00:03:19.070> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the drink bottle and there it is and the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.190 
the drink bottle and there it is and the
other<00:03:19.430> ones<00:03:19.610> down<00:03:19.820> all<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.600> way<00:03:20.720> down<00:03:20.750> there

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
other ones down all the way down there

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.650 
other ones down all the way down there
so<00:03:21.440> as<00:03:21.500> you<00:03:21.650> can<00:03:21.769> see<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.730> first<00:03:23.030> thought<00:03:23.360> has

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
so as you can see that first thought has

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.270 
so as you can see that first thought has
actually<00:03:24.200> shot<00:03:29.049> meter<00:03:30.049> maybe<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.860> meter<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.190> a

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
actually shot meter maybe a meter and a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.180 
actually shot meter maybe a meter and a
half<00:03:31.480> past<00:03:32.480> 100<00:03:32.930> foot

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
half past 100 foot

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.730 
half past 100 foot
all<00:03:34.880> right<00:03:35.090> now<00:03:35.870> that's<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.170> test<00:03:36.380> for<00:03:36.440> all

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
all right now that's the test for all

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.340 
all right now that's the test for all
done<00:03:36.920> thank<00:03:37.250> you
