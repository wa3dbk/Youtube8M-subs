in<00:05:09.610> some<00:05:10.210> live<00:05:10.480> recordings<00:05:11.080> you<00:05:11.200> can<00:05:11.230> actually

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
in some live recordings you can actually

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.350 
in some live recordings you can actually
see<00:05:11.830> Harrison<00:05:12.310> at<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.550> point<00:05:12.760> just<00:05:13.000> flip<00:05:13.210> his

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
see Harrison at this point just flip his

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.200 
see Harrison at this point just flip his
thumb<00:05:13.720> over<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.340> fret<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.520> bass<00:05:15.730> note<00:05:16.000> there

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
thumb over and fret that bass note there

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.449 
thumb over and fret that bass note there
for<00:05:16.390> F<00:05:16.510> sharp<00:05:16.810> minor<00:05:16.990> 7<00:05:17.500> flat<00:05:17.650> 5

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:20.459 

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:23.279 

then<00:05:21.459> use<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:21.819> thumb<00:05:22.119> voicing<00:05:22.659> with<00:05:22.809> the<00:05:23.050> top

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
then use the thumb voicing with the top

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.150 
then use the thumb voicing with the top
open<00:05:23.709> e<00:05:23.830> string<00:05:24.389> for<00:05:25.389> fmaj7

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.159 

so<00:05:29.160> you'd<00:05:29.280> have

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.739 

and<00:05:35.379> in<00:05:36.219> some<00:05:36.430> later<00:05:36.669> live<00:05:37.060> recordings<00:05:37.569> you'll

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:37.749 
and in some later live recordings you'll

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.570 
and in some later live recordings you'll
actually<00:05:37.930> see<00:05:38.319> him<00:05:38.560> instead<00:05:39.039> of<00:05:39.099> playing<00:05:39.370> a

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
actually see him instead of playing a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.020 
actually see him instead of playing a
minor<00:05:39.849> seven<00:05:40.210> over<00:05:40.389> G<00:05:40.659> play<00:05:41.379> C<00:05:41.439> over<00:05:42.400> G<00:05:42.639> like

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
minor seven over G play C over G like

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.629 
minor seven over G play C over G like
this

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.149 

I<00:05:45.930> should<00:05:46.930> also<00:05:47.050> point<00:05:47.349> out<00:05:47.530> an<00:05:47.710> interesting

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
I should also point out an interesting

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.399 
I should also point out an interesting
thing<00:05:48.370> that<00:05:48.789> makes<00:05:49.060> this<00:05:49.270> have<00:05:49.659> the<00:05:49.870> powerful

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
thing that makes this have the powerful

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.439 
thing that makes this have the powerful
effect<00:05:50.710> that<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> does<00:05:51.189> in<00:05:51.550> addition<00:05:51.909> to<00:05:52.300> the

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
effect that it does in addition to the

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.209 
effect that it does in addition to the
mostly<00:05:53.050> chromatic<00:05:53.499> baseline

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
mostly chromatic baseline

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.429 
mostly chromatic baseline
there's<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.729> fixed<00:05:55.240> upper<00:05:55.719> register<00:05:56.169> tones

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
there's the fixed upper register tones

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.140 
there's the fixed upper register tones
through<00:05:56.919> most<00:05:57.129> of<00:05:57.249> the<00:05:57.370> chords<00:05:57.729> meaning<00:05:58.060> the

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
through most of the chords meaning the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.360 
through most of the chords meaning the
notes<00:05:58.360> on<00:05:58.539> your<00:05:58.719> G<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:58.960> B<00:05:59.080> strings<00:05:59.229> are<00:06:00.189> the

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
notes on your G and B strings are the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.189 
notes on your G and B strings are the
same<00:06:00.610> through<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.120> majority<00:06:01.689> these<00:06:01.840> chord

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
same through the majority these chord

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:09.649 
same through the majority these chord
grips<00:06:02.439> like<00:06:02.560> this

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.509 

plus<00:06:10.659> there's<00:06:10.869> a<00:06:10.929> killer<00:06:11.319> Eric<00:06:11.799> Clapton<00:06:12.189> solo
