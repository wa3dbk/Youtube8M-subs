founder<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:28.300> glitch<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:29.980> go

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
founder of this glitch you can go

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.920 
founder of this glitch you can go
through<00:02:30.340> these<00:02:30.490> walls<00:02:30.790> not<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.480> walls<00:02:31.690> over

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
through these walls not the walls over

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.700 
through these walls not the walls over
there<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.730> then<00:02:33.970> since<00:02:34.690> you're<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
there and then since you're in the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.270 
there and then since you're in the
canyon<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.550> Canyon<00:02:37.360> level<00:02:37.750> you'll<00:02:38.560> be<00:02:38.800> under

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
canyon on Canyon level you'll be under

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.160 
canyon on Canyon level you'll be under
all<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.970> stuff<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.209> swim<00:02:43.420> around<00:02:43.840> all

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
all this stuff you can swim around all

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.290 
all this stuff you can swim around all
of<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.500> basically<00:02:45.490> this<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:46.000> running

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
of it basically this is just running

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.260 
of it basically this is just running
away<00:02:46.600> cheap<00:02:47.350> been<00:02:48.010> one<00:02:48.190> hits<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.580> you'll<00:02:48.820> fall

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
away cheap been one hits you you'll fall

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.570 
away cheap been one hits you you'll fall
down<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.959> die<00:02:51.330> suicide<00:02:52.620> you'll<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.890> count

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
down and die suicide you'll get a count

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.350 
down and die suicide you'll get a count
for<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.870> here's<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.320> only<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:57.360> battle

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
for that so here's the only like battle

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.949 
for that so here's the only like battle
strategic<00:02:59.200> thing<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.100> do<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.550> is

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
strategic thing you can do with it is

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.170 
strategic thing you can do with it is
you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.140> go<00:03:02.320> back<00:03:02.500> here<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.130> get<00:03:03.820> up<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
you can go back here and get up on a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.600 
you can go back here and get up on a
sidewalk<00:03:04.630> watch<00:03:05.530> I'll<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:06.040> right<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.220> one

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
sidewalk watch I'll get right on one

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.930 
sidewalk watch I'll get right on one
here<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.810> right<00:03:11.020> now<00:03:11.050> I'm<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.160> sidewalk

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
here so right now I'm in the sidewalk

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.979 
here so right now I'm in the sidewalk
and<00:03:13.930> then<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:15.940> shoot<00:03:16.180> out<00:03:16.360> there<00:03:16.660> you

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
and then you can shoot out there you

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.000 
and then you can shoot out there you
know<00:03:18.299> get<00:03:19.299> some<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.660> those<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.739> want<00:03:20.950> to

know get some of those if you want to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.229 
know get some of those if you want to
leave<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.549> do<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.450> usual<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.910> you're<00:03:28.120> out

my favorite level so now to investigate

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:53.310 
my favorite level so now to investigate
the<00:03:45.640> outer<00:03:46.230> regions<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:49.140> world<00:03:52.019> let's<00:03:53.019> get

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
the outer regions of the world let's get

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.650 
the outer regions of the world let's get
to<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.489> guys<00:03:57.640> once<00:03:58.030> again<00:03:58.239> just<00:03:58.450> walk<00:03:58.630> over

to it so guys once again just walk over
to<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.080> edge<00:03:59.200> oh<00:04:00.690> yeah<00:04:01.690> if<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.989> go<00:04:02.140> too<00:04:02.200> far

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
to the edge oh yeah if you go too far

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.990 
to the edge oh yeah if you go too far
you'll<00:04:02.799> die<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.250> now<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.489> know<00:04:03.610> how<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.760> do<00:04:03.880> it

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
you'll die so now you know how to do it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.800 
you'll die so now you know how to do it
don't<00:04:04.540> move<00:04:04.630> forward<00:04:04.840> go<00:04:05.230> go<00:04:05.590> okay<00:04:06.010> uh<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:07.090> swim

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
don't move forward go go okay uh I swim

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.050 
don't move forward go go okay uh I swim
all<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.140> way<00:04:08.350> not<00:04:08.769> all<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:08.980> way<00:04:09.070> out<00:04:09.160> but<00:04:09.910> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
all the way not all the way out but I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.199 
all the way not all the way out but I
swim<00:04:10.390> out<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.070> this<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.160> actually<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.730> curve

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
swim out and this is actually the curve

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.180 
swim out and this is actually the curve
it<00:04:13.959> curves<00:04:14.709> upward<00:04:15.329> the<00:04:16.329> clouds<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.950> go

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
it curves upward the clouds and you go

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.380 
it curves upward the clouds and you go
past<00:04:18.640> them<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.950> black

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
past them and it's black

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:30.160 
past them and it's black
it's<00:04:23.390> black<00:04:23.900> past<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:28.690> guess<00:04:29.690> I'll<00:04:29.900> go

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
it's black past then and I guess I'll go

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.610 
it's black past then and I guess I'll go
swim<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.830> their<00:04:31.510> made<00:04:32.510> it<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.990> end<00:04:33.140> of<00:04:33.440> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
swim to their made it to the end of the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.640 
swim to their made it to the end of the
world<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.450> what<00:04:35.450> is<00:04:35.660> there<00:04:37.510> two<00:04:38.510> layers<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
world and what is there two layers the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.240 
world and what is there two layers the
main<00:04:39.890> layer<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.400> behind<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.290> stars<00:04:42.290> which

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
main layer and behind it is stars which

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.250 
main layer and behind it is stars which
means<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.760> level<00:04:44.390> was<00:04:44.510> originally<00:04:44.990> supposed

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
means this level was originally supposed

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.660 
means this level was originally supposed
to<00:04:45.410> be<00:04:45.530> set<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:46.400> space<00:04:46.940> space<00:04:47.660> Canyon<00:04:48.260> I<00:04:48.670> think

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
to be set in space space Canyon I think

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.890 
to be set in space space Canyon I think
I've<00:04:49.730> heard<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.000> before<00:04:50.120> space<00:04:50.600> cannon

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
I've heard that before space cannon

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.970 
I've heard that before space cannon
whatever<00:04:51.380> um<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:53.150> space<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.840> canyon<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:54.410> I

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
whatever um in space the canyon and I

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.900 
whatever um in space the canyon and I
didn't<00:04:55.400> even<00:04:55.580> bother<00:04:55.760> to<00:04:55.940> take<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.510> out<00:04:56.660> and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
didn't even bother to take it out and

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.880 
didn't even bother to take it out and
I'm<00:04:58.910> swimming<00:04:59.240> into<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.870> space<00:05:00.700> this<00:05:01.700> space

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
I'm swimming into the space this space

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.490 
I'm swimming into the space this space
time<00:05:03.890> continuum<00:05:04.960> whatever<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.140> is<00:05:06.410> uh<00:05:08.500> can

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
time continuum whatever that is uh can

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.720 
time continuum whatever that is uh can
