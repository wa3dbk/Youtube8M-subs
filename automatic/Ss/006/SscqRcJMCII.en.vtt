00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.060
 hola que tal hope you find of 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.740
 the best I am here the manager of git 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.660
 astute and this time we're going to 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.099
 perform a series of exercises to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.019
 that you practice your hand technique 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.669
 left and right hand in this 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.349
 video I will not have to explain every 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.059
 one of the techniques therefore you 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.769
 I highly recommend that you review the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.150
 video techniques to reach out and touch 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.980
 right and the techniques video for 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.810
 touch with the left hand because 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.839
 you will need them to understand 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.429
 fully this video the only thing that 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.619
 we need to specify for this video 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.300
 is that the fingers of the left hand and 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.219
 on the right hand they have denominations 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.110
 different and based on those 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.000
 denominations we are going to locate for 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.260
 be able to practice a lot of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.780
 exercises the fingers of the hand 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.480
 left are named from the index to me 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.219
 I said as of one two three and four the 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.829
 thumb has no denomination because it 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.050
 find behind the kingfisher remember 1 2 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.690
 3 4 in relation to the fingers of the hand 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.170
 right they receive the name according to 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.320
 its initial is to say the thumb is the finger 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 index is the finger and the middle is the m 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 is the finger so as a matter p &amp; m 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.630
 the little finger does not have a name because 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.780
 according to the correct techniques for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.640
 playing classical guitar is not used without 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 However, as a personal recommendation 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 you use it in an arpeggio a strum 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.930
 much better personally the more 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.400
 of what you use better first thing 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.090
 let's review are the techniques for 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.430
 make points 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.110
 you can use with your right hand 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.050
 the technique that you like most, be it the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.900
 technical supporting 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.820
 the pulling technique 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.130
 however, I recommend you use 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 both for you to master them 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.560
 Left hand exercises are very 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 simple because only 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.390
 We need to know how it is that we are going to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.660
 step on each of the strings for this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.340
 For example, we received some coordinates 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.440
 that in this case we are going to carry out the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.860
 coordinates 1 2 3 4 which means 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.750
 that would be 1 2 3 4 the 1st finger in the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.600
 first the 2 in the second and 3 in the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.280
 third and fourth on the fourth fret and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.230
 we're going to do it in the sixth in the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.910
 fifth in the fourth in the third and 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.430
 then when we get to the first one we go 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.899
 to go up the second for the third one 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.270
 I 'll show it quickly so 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.590
 consume a lot of video time but 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.830
 so you can get an idea of ​​how it is that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.830
 it will be 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 two 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.950
 and they realize the sixth the first and 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.280
 rise in the first to the sixth and what 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.950
 The only thing I did was to use 1-2-3-4 at 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.599
 principle maybe not so fast but in 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.459
 practical basis I assure you that you are going to 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.890
 Achieve explains the exercise more 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.900
 basic 1 2 3 4 because on the basis of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.700
 this you will be able to do the exercise 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.040
 that you only want to alternate 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.110
 for example the 1 and then it will not continue 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.430
 the 2 you can follow the 3 and now if the 2 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.069
 and then the 4 or that could be 13 24 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.650
 13 24 and so you're going to do it 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.120
 from top to bottom and from bottom to top this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 so that you do not type 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.599
 only in making a move because 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.370
 then when you check a scale you do not go 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.099
 to be able to do it, I recommend you 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.359
 do all the possible exercises 14 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.909
 23 13 24 13 42 where the purpose of your 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.340
 hand is fully adaptable to 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.609
 any sequence this because 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.040
 the scales are practically that's a 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.989
 finger after another finger in relation to this 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.329
 pattern whether that first is 1 then 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.440
 4 and then another rope jumps me and 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.840
 I'm going to do 1 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.840
 4 for example the sun scale 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.310
 you can see that practically 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.890
 it is this scale only that with certain 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.510
 values outward I'm just going to 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.400
 use certain channels so you 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.050
 I highly recommend that you exercise 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.690
 using a series of patterns 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.370
 different not only in 1234 but that 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.020
 invent all you want 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.040
 obviously using the two techniques 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.959
 so that the two thousand 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.140
 now let's review the exercises 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.459
 to perform arpeggios as we saw the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.640
 fingers of the right hand are called 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.739
 as p &amp; m and in relation to how it is that 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.719
 It takes the same page I 'm like it's going to 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.760
 name the same arpeggio is to say yes 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.189
 I was an arpeggio I use the thumb 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 index the half dollar is arpeggio receives 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:17.419
 the name of p &amp; m because they are the two that 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.100
 use if the arpeggio added the medium 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:23.130
 again for example 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.360
 receives the name of arpeggio p &amp; m and other 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.440
 time 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.440
 pn 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.020
 so based on this you will be able to 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.450
 do the amount of species that you 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.980
 want for the practices in this 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.630
 I'll give you some advice so that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.510
 the practice is again and again in order 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.860
 that your hand becomes more agile you can 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.240
 do the arpeggios that you want for 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.010
 example the following arpeggio is very 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.900
 basic and is the one that we are going to use for 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.680
 practice it's about repression 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.680
 internal 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.580
 and this time I'm going to show you something 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.470
 so that practice is a child again 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.530
 in order that your right hand will 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.720
 do as agile as possible we will place 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.449
 the index and the middle on the first fret 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.699
 of the fourth and second rope and the 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.760
 annular and the little finger on the second fret 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.620
 of the third and the first body is 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.690
 it's about a diminished counter 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.880
 I leave you on the screen a zoom of this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.669
 chord and also the triad so that 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.560
 I can review it calmly and in 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.750
 basis of this chord we will perform the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.340
 arpeggio for example the one that I mentioned you 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.660
 recently that is appearing in 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.009
 screen the diagram according to the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.610
 fingers 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.379
 and we're going to do the arpeggio once and in 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.990
 the next one we're just going to change 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.669
 below is to say if we use the sixth 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.039
 rope after we're going to use the 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.490
 fifth and we will do the same and 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.909
 then the fourth so the exercise 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.909
 it would be 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.100
 and you're going to do that tour, that is, 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.410
 using each of the lows by 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.110
 every time you say the chord so 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.640
 I'm going to do that in this position what 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.100
 I'm going to do it again when he says it in 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.920
 the second fret in the third in the 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.550
 fourth in the fifth in the sixth and I 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.170
 I want until 11 others I'll 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.270
 show quickly so you can see how 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.380
 is that so you can practice it 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.380
 according to the correct method 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.939
 in a long time 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.650
 and so on until it arrives 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.800
 to the frets and we're going to do 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.800
 reverse 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.469
 and you're going to practice this exercise with the 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.479
 so that his right hand does this 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.969
 move naturally and get used to 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.830
 to be as it is logical there is a great 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.599
 amount of patterns so you can 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.429
 practice your arpeggios but in this 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.439
 occasion I will limit myself without because it is 

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:47.659
 the one that is going to let go of your hand so 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:49.669
 You can do it properly quickly 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.169
 I remind you that at the beginning this is going 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.139
 to serve as space there is no hurry 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.099
 all the time will continue to improve if 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.599
 I served you in my video
