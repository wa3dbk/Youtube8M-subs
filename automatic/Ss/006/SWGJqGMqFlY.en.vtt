00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the exits I point to the mouseholes

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.010 
the exits I point to the mouseholes
right<00:01:56.490> pretend<00:01:56.969> there's<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.180> mouse<00:01:57.630> hole<00:01:57.840> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
so I go exit mouseholes

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.760 
so I go exit mouseholes
