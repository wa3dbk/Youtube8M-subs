00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
punishment for all who would believe

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.699

through<00:02:47.459> all<00:02:47.639> of<00:02:47.670> human<00:02:47.879> history<00:02:48.439> which<00:02:49.439> if

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
through all of human history which if

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.890 
through all of human history which if
each<00:02:49.980> were<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.489> bear<00:02:50.670> would<00:02:51.060> take<00:02:51.269> forever<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.849 
they would never be able to pay it back
that's<00:02:53.939> why<00:02:54.150> hell<00:02:54.389> is<00:02:54.540> forever<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:55.469> because
