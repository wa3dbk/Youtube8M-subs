00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
thing my webcam may look a little bit

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.150 
thing my webcam may look a little bit
shitty<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.299> reason<00:00:06.660> for<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.259> basically

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
shitty the reason for that is basically

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.160 
shitty the reason for that is basically
I've<00:00:08.309> got<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> new<00:00:08.700> one<00:00:08.849> it's<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.150> logitech<00:00:09.540> c920

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
I've got a new one it's a logitech c920

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.190 
I've got a new one it's a logitech c920
and<00:00:10.620> while<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.309> fantastic<00:00:11.849> webcam<00:00:12.509> it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and while it is a fantastic webcam it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480 
and while it is a fantastic webcam it
probably<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:13.740> takes<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.009> little<00:00:14.219> bit<00:00:14.340> more

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
probably just takes a little bit more

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.799 
probably just takes a little bit more
setting<00:00:14.820> up<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> old<00:00:15.240> one<00:00:15.389> did<00:00:15.570> because

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
setting up in the old one did because

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.410 
setting up in the old one did because
the<00:00:15.900> old<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.980> probably<00:00:17.550> designed<00:00:17.940> for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the old one was probably designed for

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.080 
the old one was probably designed for
not<00:00:19.020> very<00:00:19.230> tacky<00:00:19.560> people<00:00:20.039> anyway<00:00:21.029> so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
not very tacky people anyway so

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.090 
not very tacky people anyway so
basically<00:00:21.900> why<00:00:22.410> we're<00:00:22.560> doing<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.920> video

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
basically why we're doing this video

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
basically why we're doing this video
well<00:00:23.490> contents<00:00:24.330> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.900> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
well contents kind of going to go to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439

through<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> question<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.739> why<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
through so the question is why is this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.610 
through so the question is why is this
happening<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:42.270> first<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.870> probably

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
happening well first of all probably

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
happening well first of all probably
more<00:00:44.149> significantly<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.420> stops<00:00:46.079> looking

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
more significantly as well stops looking

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
more significantly as well stops looking
pretty<00:00:46.649> bad<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.160> ground<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.820> like

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
pretty bad for my ground and that like

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.270 
pretty bad for my ground and that like
chances<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.989> he's<00:00:49.110> probably<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> may

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
chances are he's probably like you may

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.319 
chances are he's probably like you may

mean<00:01:41.100> they're<00:01:41.280> actually<00:01:41.939> they're<00:01:42.090> they're

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
mean they're actually they're they're

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
mean they're actually they're they're
kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.020> their<00:01:43.170> easy<00:01:43.380> exams<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.189> cover

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
kind of their easy exams but they cover

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160 
kind of their easy exams but they cover
a<00:01:44.549> whole<00:01:44.790> bunch<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> content<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a whole bunch of content and it's the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.990 
a whole bunch of content and it's the
kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> thing<00:01:46.619> where<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.399> university<00:01:47.880> will

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
kind of thing where the university will

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
kind of thing where the university will
have<00:01:48.119> three<00:01:48.390> modules<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> year<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
have three modules in the year right and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.380 
have three modules in the year right and
you<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.399> big<00:01:50.640> module<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.240> our

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
you have the one big module like our

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030 
you have the one big module like our
programming<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.680> really

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
programming one which is really

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
programming one which is really
important<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.759> hard<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.479> takes<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
important it's really hard it takes a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
important it's really hard it takes a
lot<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.899> work<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> module<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
lot of work but it's the module that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
lot of work but it's the module that
actually<00:01:56.729> matters<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
actually matters then you have the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
actually matters then you have the
 modules<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.899> game

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
 modules like and the game

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
 modules like and the game
design<00:02:01.409> module<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> taught<00:02:02.549> by<00:02:02.579> an

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
design module which is taught by an

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
design module which is taught by an
idiot<00:02:03.240> who<00:02:03.450> literally<00:02:03.960> knows<00:02:04.200> nothing<00:02:04.560> about

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
idiot who literally knows nothing about

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
idiot who literally knows nothing about
game<00:02:04.860> design<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> hilarious<00:02:05.790> also

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
game design just kind of hilarious also

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.940 
game design just kind of hilarious also
I'm<00:02:06.780> pretty<00:02:07.170> sure<00:02:07.409> I've<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.710> mental

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I'm pretty sure I've got a mental

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.229 
I'm pretty sure I've got a mental
illness<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.429> reading<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> slides<00:02:09.090> because

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
illness from reading of slides because

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.720 
illness from reading of slides because
he<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:09.690> use<00:02:09.989> capitalization<00:02:10.979> right<00:02:11.190> or

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
he doesn't use capitalization right or

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.240 
he doesn't use capitalization right or
spacing<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
spacing or

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.830 
spacing or
a<00:02:13.280> cohesive<00:02:13.610> font<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.270> anything<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:14.720> that

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
a cohesive font or anything like that

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.090 
a cohesive font or anything like that
they<00:02:15.350> don't<00:02:15.470> weigh<00:02:15.530> enough<00:02:15.560> for<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.860> so

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
they don't weigh enough for that so

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.290 
they don't weigh enough for that so
there's<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.340> module<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.820> this<00:02:16.910> network's

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
there's that module and this network's

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.690 
there's that module and this network's
one<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.750> both<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.320> them<00:02:18.470> are<00:02:18.620> kind<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.010> easy<00:02:19.520> in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
one and both of them are kind of easy in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.070 
one and both of them are kind of easy in
terms<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.940> content<00:02:20.300> it's<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> lot<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.990> it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
terms of content it's just a lot of it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.320

people know that i'm not dead and the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.520 
people know that i'm not dead and the
