it's a retrofit kit that you know as
eighteen<00:02:49.430> different<00:02:49.550> open<00:02:49.910> tunings<00:02:50.240> six<00:02:50.480> you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
eighteen different open tunings six you

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:58.770 
eighteen different open tunings six you
can<00:02:50.720> program<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.350> own

the<00:02:59.780> tuning<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.950> works<00:03:01.280> with<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> lithium

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the tuning it works with a lithium

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.080 
the tuning it works with a lithium
polymer<00:03:02.299> battery<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.889> good<00:03:04.129> for<00:03:04.340> 300

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090

so I'm back to send that yuning does

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.209 
so I'm back to send that yuning does
that<00:03:13.189> you<00:03:13.249> believe<00:03:13.489> me<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:13.760> like<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:16.010> iam

between<00:03:19.939> the<00:03:20.030> tunings<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.930> recharge<00:03:21.109> it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
between the tunings you can recharge it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.920 
between the tunings you can recharge it
and<00:03:21.620> with<00:03:21.859> your<00:03:21.950> existing<00:03:22.159> charger<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.969> but

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
also of course you can tune so manually

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.149 
also of course you can tune so manually
so<00:03:26.810> people<00:03:27.200> are<00:03:27.319> would<00:03:27.469> be<00:03:27.620> scared<00:03:27.919> saying

happens<00:03:29.629> when<00:03:29.780> when<00:03:30.139> the<00:03:30.230> battery<00:03:30.469> is<00:03:30.560> there

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
happens when when the battery is there

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.280 
happens when when the battery is there
or<00:03:30.859> something<00:03:31.129> I<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.730> saw<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.419> can<00:03:32.569> move

or something I just saw you you can move
those<00:03:33.469> manually<00:03:33.829> yeah<00:03:33.950> detune<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.609> now<00:03:34.760> for

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
those manually yeah detune this now for

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.550 
those manually yeah detune this now for
you<00:03:35.389> that<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:36.019> it's<00:03:36.169> not<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.319> trigger

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
you that you see it's not a trigger

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.569 
you that you see it's not a trigger
something<00:03:37.689> pretty<00:03:38.689> bad<00:03:38.959> right<00:03:39.340> well<00:03:40.340> this<00:03:40.459> is

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
something pretty bad right well this is

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.099 
something pretty bad right well this is
some<00:03:40.760> on<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.120> always<00:03:41.299> remembers<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.959> last

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
some on it always remembers the last

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.030 
some on it always remembers the last
tuning<00:03:43.719> so<00:03:44.719> I'm<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:44.959> the<00:03:45.079> strings<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:45.650> again

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
tuning so I'm all the strings and again

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.979 
tuning so I'm all the strings and again
green<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.609> tune<00:03:46.790> yellow<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.419> tuning<00:03:47.840> and

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
green is in tune yellow is tuning and

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.869 
green is in tune yellow is tuning and
red<00:03:48.560> means<00:03:48.799> it's<00:03:48.919> still<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.310> tune<00:03:49.459> so<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.669> just

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
red means it's still in tune so I just

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.250 
red means it's still in tune so I just
picked<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.150> last<00:03:50.329> two<00:03:50.510> strings<00:03:50.780> again<00:03:51.049> in

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
picked the last two strings again in

00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:04.560 
picked the last two strings again in
this<00:03:52.159> case<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.669> now<00:03:53.180> I'm<00:03:53.329> back

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.790 

right<00:04:05.570> now<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.170> cool<00:04:06.380> thing<00:04:06.410> let's<00:04:06.740> say

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
right now the cool thing let's say

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.310 
right now the cool thing let's say
string<00:04:07.490> chains<00:04:07.790> string<00:04:08.630> breaks<00:04:08.870> all<00:04:09.110> you<00:04:09.170> want

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
string chains string breaks all you want

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.420 
string chains string breaks all you want
to<00:04:09.410> change<00:04:09.590> your<00:04:09.710> strings<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:10.070> go<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.250> the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
to change your strings I go to the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.090 
to change your strings I go to the
string<00:04:10.640> change<00:04:10.880> mode<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.780> know

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.500 

so<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.160> see<00:04:19.400> now<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.639> string<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.120> very<00:04:20.209> loose

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
so you see now the string is very loose

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.879 
so you see now the string is very loose
I<00:04:20.840> could<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.139> put<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.620> new<00:04:21.739> string<00:04:22.070> on<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.710> go

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
I could I put the new string on and go

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.070 
I could I put the new string on and go
up<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.520> first<00:04:25.669> opening<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.540> lock<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.930> with

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
up to the first opening and lock it with

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.290 
up to the first opening and lock it with
my<00:04:27.290> fingers<00:04:27.950> or<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.400> little<00:04:28.730> coin<00:04:28.970> and

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
my fingers or like a little coin and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.300 
my fingers or like a little coin and
then<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:31.000> put<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.240> tension<00:04:32.450> on<00:04:32.720> again<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:34.160> know

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
then I put the tension on again you know

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.800 
then I put the tension on again you know
and<00:04:34.490> at<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.700> certain<00:04:34.910> point<00:04:35.060> when<00:04:35.330> there's<00:04:35.690> a

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
and at a certain point when there's a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.600 
and at a certain point when there's a
note<00:04:36.260> and<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.620> system<00:04:36.950> kicks<00:04:37.190> in<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
note and the system kicks in and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.150 
note and the system kicks in and
actually<00:04:38.330> will<00:04:38.540> tune<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.800> that's<00:04:39.950> already

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
actually will tune it and that's already

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.360 
actually will tune it and that's already
yet<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.790> see<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.150> was<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> string<00:04:41.630> change

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.129 

yeah<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.820> retrofit<00:04:47.389> as<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:47.570> said<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:48.020> was<00:04:48.080> very

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
yeah it retrofit as I said it was very

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.020 
yeah it retrofit as I said it was very
very<00:04:48.590> easy<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.980> saw<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.520> one<00:04:49.669> thing<00:04:52.030> you

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
very easy I saw to you one thing you

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.270 
very easy I saw to you one thing you
know<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:53.960> take<00:04:54.169> out<00:04:54.380> here<00:04:54.800> or<00:04:54.979> a<00:04:55.010> sword

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
know you just take out here or a sword

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.920 
know you just take out here or a sword
like<00:04:55.370> this<00:04:57.010> remove<00:04:58.010> your<00:04:58.490> original<00:04:59.030> tuners

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
like this remove your original tuners

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.219 
like this remove your original tuners
and<00:05:00.080> then<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.710> just<00:05:01.310> drop<00:05:01.729> fits<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.389> like

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
and then this just drop fits in like
