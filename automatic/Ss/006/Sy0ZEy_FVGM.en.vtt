bike<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.479> they<00:04:26.570> are<00:04:26.750> there<00:04:27.560> they're<00:04:27.860> really

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
bike and they are there they're really

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.450 
bike and they are there they're really
to<00:04:28.340> bridge<00:04:28.729> human<00:04:29.720> desire<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.470> mechanical

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
to bridge human desire and mechanical

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.420 
to bridge human desire and mechanical
possibility<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.450> inside<00:04:32.960> here<00:04:33.220> you've<00:04:34.220> got<00:04:34.400> a
