00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.960
 That came to the last row that is 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.610
 now I need to connect the two halves 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.779
 I think that such a rim 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.110
 will be good for the testicle for this we 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.820
 We look what now bead should 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.640
 go and the last row is the start of the first 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.769
 a number of which we have already done significantly 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.800
 one of you goes white and gets us 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:53.079
 take one white universe and connect 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.079
 green white falls into white 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.060
 and so we close the whole part 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.390
 now i take the eggshells and don 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.290
 billet left dopelet only bottom 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.080
 and top 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.270
 but where prostrate where the top you decide you want 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.440
 to the top were green stripes 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.640
 change the workpiece 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.990
 dress her differently now let's get started 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 to the treatment of riding here we brought 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.660
 like a needle in the upper bead here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.460
 these teeth that we have formed 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 from three bead 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.860
 with this top sirin komi we 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.580
 now and we will work i will take 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.370
 golden beads so that I can see 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.519
 just doing me 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.800
 fishing line out of the upper cloves now 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.800
 I take one golden bead 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.700
 and spend a needle in the next clove 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.680
 so I shorten the distance in 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.360
 row and it turns out that over time the ranks 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.440
 are already getting further 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.540
 I continue this work around the circle 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.210
 again take one golden bead and 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.810
 I spend the needle already in the next 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.810
 next cog 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.530
 and so on to the next row 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.650
 I need to add the last one 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.620
 the bead from the first row is immediately noticeable as 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.170
 1 row has already pulled 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.650
 basis and it fits more even 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.290
 testicle in order to move to the second 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.770
 row and this is her second row will do from 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.020
 white beads I will always pass 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.020
 between the golden beads 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.190
 so i do until i 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.970
 notice it's time 1 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.160
 beads clean up to follow the form 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.820
 testicle 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.850
 how this is done i will show soon after 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.610
 As I wove so many rows I 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.210
 right now, I'll show you how to collect unnecessary 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.400
 beads to make the medium shorter 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.660
 between the protruding beads, I for sure 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.120
 also spend 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.430
 new let's say between these two 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.590
 enough space to hold one 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.590
 bead her spend 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.590
 farther between these two with me too 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.660
 there must be one bead but between them 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.170
 so little space that it won't fit 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.080
 so I spend the needle 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:18.320
 her already for the next look to 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:22.310
 pick up the bead to fit and spend 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.310
 her between these two 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.250
 I cleaned not very many beads post 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.940
 the room picked up the beads so they 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.280
 getting thinner and thinner towards the top 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.360
 eggs so the work turns out 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.360
 more accurate
