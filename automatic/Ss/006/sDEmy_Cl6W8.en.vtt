00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
I'm gonna I'm gonna go to the bucket and

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.830 
I'm gonna I'm gonna go to the bucket and
then<00:06:33.750> go<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:33.990> flood<00:06:34.530> mode<00:06:34.850> global<00:06:35.850> and<00:06:36.630> then

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
then go to flood mode global and then

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.410 
then go to flood mode global and then
just<00:06:37.020> remember<00:06:37.650> tolerance<00:06:38.370> zero<00:06:38.640> just

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
just remember tolerance zero just

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.360 
just remember tolerance zero just
coloring<00:06:39.780> all<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.080> red<00:06:40.290> and<00:06:40.560> then<00:06:40.800> go<00:06:40.980> to<00:06:41.040> dark

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
coloring all the red and then go to dark

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.230 
coloring all the red and then go to dark
green<00:06:42.950> and<00:06:43.950> I'm<00:06:44.040> covering<00:06:44.400> all<00:06:44.460> the<00:06:44.580> green<00:06:44.820> and

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
green and I'm covering all the green and

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.280 
green and I'm covering all the green and
then<00:06:46.340> go<00:06:47.340> like<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:47.850> a<00:06:47.880> red<00:06:48.300> I<00:06:48.330> guess<00:06:51.050> yeah

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
then go like to a red I guess yeah

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.380 
then go like to a red I guess yeah
so<00:06:52.500> there<00:06:52.680> you<00:06:52.710> go<00:06:52.850> there's<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:53.970> cusp<00:06:54.270> of

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
so there you go there's the cusp of

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:02.150 
so there you go there's the cusp of
sprite<00:06:54.950> and<00:06:58.280> I<00:06:59.280> guess<00:07:00.180> that's<00:07:00.420> it<00:07:00.660> for<00:07:01.160> this

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
sprite and I guess that's it for this

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.190 
sprite and I guess that's it for this
