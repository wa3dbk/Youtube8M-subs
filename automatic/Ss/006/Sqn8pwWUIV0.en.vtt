00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
mixed numbers the steps that you will

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.360 
mixed numbers the steps that you will
follow<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:44.360> first<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.470> all<00:00:45.590> we<00:00:45.650> convert

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
follow is this first of all we convert

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.979 
follow is this first of all we convert
the<00:00:46.670> mixed<00:00:46.910> numbers<00:00:47.450> into<00:00:47.660> improper

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
the mixed numbers into improper

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.840 
the mixed numbers into improper
fractions<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.970> 2<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.800> 2/3<00:00:51.800> I'm<00:00:52.130> going<00:00:52.760> to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
fractions so 2 and 2/3 I'm going to

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.810 
fractions so 2 and 2/3 I'm going to
convert<00:00:53.210> into<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.600> improper<00:00:54.350> fraction<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.160> 8

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.530 
convert into the improper fraction of 8
over<00:00:56.329> 3<00:00:56.360> or<00:00:56.780> 8/3<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:57.649> do<00:00:58.130> that<00:00:58.370> by<00:00:58.520> multiplying<00:00:58.730> 3

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
over 3 or 8/3 I do that by multiplying 3

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.750 
over 3 or 8/3 I do that by multiplying 3
times<00:00:59.570> 2<00:01:00.110> which<00:01:00.350> is<00:01:00.380> 6<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.040> adding<00:01:01.370> 2<00:01:01.730> more

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
times 2 which is 6 and adding 2 more

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.010 
times 2 which is 6 and adding 2 more
which<00:01:02.480> gives<00:01:02.780> me<00:01:02.930> 8<00:01:04.420> then<00:01:05.420> I'm<00:01:05.630> going<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.840> take

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
which gives me 8 then I'm going to take

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.590 
which gives me 8 then I'm going to take
my<00:01:06.200> second<00:01:06.650> fraction<00:01:06.830> negative<00:01:07.520> 3<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.060> 1/4

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
my second fraction negative 3 and 1/4

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.899 
my second fraction negative 3 and 1/4
I'm<00:01:08.930> going<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.140> convert<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.500> 4<00:01:10.220> times<00:01:10.430> 3<00:01:10.880> is

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
I'm going to convert that 4 times 3 is

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.510 
I'm going to convert that 4 times 3 is
12<00:01:11.000> plus<00:01:11.600> 1<00:01:11.720> is<00:01:11.870> 13<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.130> keep<00:01:13.280> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
12 plus 1 is 13 I have to keep the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.880 
12 plus 1 is 13 I have to keep the
negative<00:01:13.760> in<00:01:14.210> there<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.080> now<00:01:15.229> my<00:01:15.409> second

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
negative in there so now my second

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.870 
our answer in an improper form this is
it<00:01:59.600> it's<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:00.229> simplified<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.189> not<00:02:01.369> improper

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
it it's not simplified it's not improper

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.850 
it it's not simplified it's not improper
but<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.360> would<00:02:02.540> be<00:02:02.720> an<00:02:02.960> acceptable<00:02:03.470> answer

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
but that would be an acceptable answer

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.719 
but that would be an acceptable answer
yes<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:04.880> equal<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.390> 104<00:02:06.200> over<00:02:06.500> 12<00:02:06.770> but<00:02:07.579> we're

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
yes it is equal to 104 over 12 but we're

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.729 
yes it is equal to 104 over 12 but we're
going<00:02:07.939> to<00:02:08.030> take<00:02:08.209> this<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.659> the<00:02:08.689> next<00:02:09.049> level<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
going to take this to the next level and

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.750 
going to take this to the next level and
actually<00:02:10.130> convert<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.700> back<00:02:10.729> into<00:02:11.480> being<00:02:11.690> a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
actually convert it back into being a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.370 
actually convert it back into being a
fraction<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.880> lowest<00:02:13.910> terms<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
fraction in lowest terms and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.570 
fraction in lowest terms and
so<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.590> mixed<00:02:16.010> number<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:18.620> could

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
so a mixed number so here I could

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.190 
so a mixed number so here I could
convert<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.030> improper<00:02:20.210> fraction<00:02:20.570> into<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
convert the improper fraction into a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400 
convert the improper fraction into a
mixed<00:02:21.290> number<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:22.070> going<00:02:22.490> to<00:02:22.610> divide<00:02:23.410> 104

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
mixed number I'm going to divide 104

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.850 
mixed number I'm going to divide 104
divided<00:02:25.010> by<00:02:25.340> 12<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.090> when<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.290> get<00:02:27.500> 8

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
divided by 12 and when I do that I get 8

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.780 
divided by 12 and when I do that I get 8
8<00:02:28.550> times<00:02:29.150> 12<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.930> 96<00:02:30.370> so<00:02:31.370> I'm<00:02:31.430> going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> write

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
8 times 12 is 96 so I'm going to write

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.520 
8 times 12 is 96 so I'm going to write
that<00:02:31.970> down

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
that down

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.660 
that down
96<00:02:33.530> I'm<00:02:33.830> going<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.100> subtract<00:02:35.050> 104<00:02:36.050> minus<00:02:37.010> 96

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
96 I'm going to subtract 104 minus 96

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.170 
96 I'm going to subtract 104 minus 96
and<00:02:38.030> I'm<00:02:38.630> going<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.320> 8<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.640> means<00:02:41.000> I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and I'm going to get 8 so that means I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.330 
and I'm going to get 8 so that means I
have<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.600> remainder<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.410> 8<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:44.600> so

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.970 

now<00:02:51.340> what<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.150> do<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.720> take<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.230> number<00:02:53.530> here

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
now what I do is I take this number here

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.870 
now what I do is I take this number here
eight<00:02:54.280> that's<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:55.000> whole<00:02:55.209> number<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:56.880> my

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
eight that's my whole number and my

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.070 
eight that's my whole number and my
remainder<00:02:58.440> becomes<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.920> fraction<00:03:00.760> eight

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
remainder becomes the fraction eight

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.160 
remainder becomes the fraction eight
over<00:03:02.080> twelve<00:03:03.209> twelve<00:03:04.209> remains<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.780> same<00:03:04.989> as

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
over twelve twelve remains the same as

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.380 
over twelve twelve remains the same as
my<00:03:05.349> denominator<00:03:05.590> right<00:03:06.280> there<00:03:06.580> whole<00:03:07.030> number

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
my denominator right there whole number

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.660 
my denominator right there whole number
goes<00:03:07.599> into<00:03:07.840> whole<00:03:08.080> number<00:03:08.440> remainder<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
goes into whole number remainder is the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.490 
goes into whole number remainder is the
remainder<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> denominator<00:03:11.170> remains

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
remainder and the denominator remains

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.490 
remainder and the denominator remains
the<00:03:11.709> same<00:03:11.950> now<00:03:12.700> what<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.390> need<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.840> remember<00:03:14.170> is

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the same now what I need to remember is

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.890 
the same now what I need to remember is
that<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.130> negative<00:03:15.430> number<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.750> it

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
that this is a negative number so it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500 
that this is a negative number so it
stays<00:03:17.170> negative<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.610> can<00:03:18.910> reduce<00:03:19.239> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
stays negative and I can reduce the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.780 
stays negative and I can reduce the
fraction<00:03:19.690> into<00:03:20.319> lowest<00:03:20.830> terms<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.580> eight

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
fraction into lowest terms because eight

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.809 
fraction into lowest terms because eight
over<00:03:22.269> twelve<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:22.989> equal<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.650> two<00:03:24.130> thirds<00:03:24.519> I

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
over twelve is equal to two thirds I

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.059 
over twelve is equal to two thirds I
divide<00:03:25.420> both<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.720> numbers<00:03:26.200> by<00:03:26.380> four<00:03:26.739> eight

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
divide both the numbers by four eight

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.090 
divide both the numbers by four eight
divided<00:03:27.430> by<00:03:27.580> four<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:28.209> two<00:03:28.870> twelve<00:03:29.709> divided<00:03:30.010> by

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
divided by four is two twelve divided by

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.970 
divided by four is two twelve divided by
4<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.459> 3<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.630> my<00:03:31.810> final<00:03:32.049> answer<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.560> will<00:03:32.830> be

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
4 is 3 so my final answer that will be

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.479 
4 is 3 so my final answer that will be
negative<00:03:33.310> eight<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.209> two<00:03:34.900> thirds<00:03:37.980> from<00:03:38.980> here

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
negative eight and two thirds from here

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.770 
negative eight and two thirds from here
on<00:03:39.640> out<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.970> going<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.180> show<00:03:40.330> several

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
on out I'm going to show several

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.449 
on out I'm going to show several
examples<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.470> can<00:03:41.650> go<00:03:41.769> ahead<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.099> pause<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
examples you can go ahead and pause the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.770 
examples you can go ahead and pause the
recording<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:43.000> try<00:03:43.239> them<00:03:43.420> on<00:03:43.510> your<00:03:43.690> own

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
recording and try them on your own

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.570 
recording and try them on your own
follow<00:03:44.140> those<00:03:44.410> same<00:03:44.620> steps<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.280> talked

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
follow those same steps that I talked

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.750 
follow those same steps that I talked
about<00:03:45.730> earlier<00:03:46.060> but<00:03:47.040> basically<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.430> is<00:03:48.580> what

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
about earlier but basically this is what

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.120 
about earlier but basically this is what
we're<00:03:48.910> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.120> do<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.920> right

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
we're going to do all right

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.940 
we're going to do all right
so<00:03:52.030> I'm<00:03:52.120> converting<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:52.780> into<00:03:53.109> an<00:03:53.350> improper

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
so I'm converting this into an improper

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.319 
so I'm converting this into an improper
fraction<00:03:53.980> 5<00:03:54.640> times<00:03:54.970> 3<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.269> 15<00:03:55.600> plus<00:03:56.440> 2<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.100> 17<00:03:57.730> so

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
fraction 5 times 3 is 15 plus 2 is 17 so

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.610 
fraction 5 times 3 is 15 plus 2 is 17 so
I<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.450> negative<00:03:58.720> 17<00:03:59.500> over<00:03:59.799> 5<00:04:00.070> times<00:04:00.910> 4<00:04:01.870> which

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
I have negative 17 over 5 times 4 which

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.340 
I have negative 17 over 5 times 4 which
can<00:04:02.859> be<00:04:02.980> written<00:04:03.130> as<00:04:03.370> 4<00:04:03.670> over<00:04:04.060> 1<00:04:04.090> now<00:04:04.959> I'm<00:04:05.079> going

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
can be written as 4 over 1 now I'm going

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.630 
can be written as 4 over 1 now I'm going
to<00:04:05.440> multiply<00:04:05.730> 17<00:04:06.730> times<00:04:07.120> 4<00:04:07.540> which<00:04:08.109> gives<00:04:08.200> me<00:04:08.640> 68

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
to multiply 17 times 4 which gives me 68

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
to multiply 17 times 4 which gives me 68
and<00:04:10.000> 5<00:04:10.780> times<00:04:11.140> 1<00:04:11.440> which<00:04:11.650> gives<00:04:11.859> me<00:04:12.100> 5<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.450> can

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
and 5 times 1 which gives me 5 and I can

remember here that I was multiplying
negative<00:04:55.510> 17<00:04:56.440> times<00:04:56.770> 4<00:04:57.159> so<00:04:57.789> that<00:04:57.970> will<00:04:58.120> give<00:04:58.270> me

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
negative 17 times 4 so that will give me

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.110

form<00:06:39.289> and<00:06:39.560> I<00:06:40.039> know<00:06:40.099> that<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.699> has<00:06:40.909> common

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
form and I know that it has common

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:47.409 
form and I know that it has common
factor<00:06:42.139> of<00:06:42.169> 4<00:06:42.710> in<00:06:43.039> each<00:06:43.279> number<00:06:45.520> 108<00:06:46.520> divided

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
factor of 4 in each number 108 divided

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:54.730 
factor of 4 in each number 108 divided
by<00:06:47.690> 4<00:06:48.110> is<00:06:48.770> equal<00:06:49.069> to<00:06:49.419> 27<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:52.840> 160<00:06:53.840> divided<00:06:54.199> by<00:06:54.440> 4

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
by 4 is equal to 27 and 160 divided by 4

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.700 
by 4 is equal to 27 and 160 divided by 4
is<00:06:54.979> equal<00:06:55.009> to<00:06:55.340> 40<00:06:55.729> so<00:06:56.509> that's<00:06:56.719> my<00:06:56.990> fraction<00:06:57.560> at

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
is equal to 40 so that's my fraction at

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.790 
is equal to 40 so that's my fraction at
the<00:06:57.860> end<00:06:58.009> in<00:06:58.250> lowest<00:06:58.639> terms<00:06:58.699> now<00:06:59.800> you'll

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
the end in lowest terms now you'll

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.860 
the end in lowest terms now you'll
notice<00:07:01.039> I<00:07:01.310> never<00:07:01.520> even<00:07:01.759> addressed<00:07:02.360> what<00:07:02.690> we're

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
notice I never even addressed what we're

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.779 
notice I never even addressed what we're
doing<00:07:03.169> with<00:07:03.349> these<00:07:03.529> negatives<00:07:04.159> that's

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
doing with these negatives that's

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.369 
doing with these negatives that's
because<00:07:05.060> I<00:07:05.150> know<00:07:05.210> a<00:07:05.360> negative<00:07:05.719> times<00:07:06.229> a

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:06.379 
because I know a negative times a

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.980 
because I know a negative times a
negative<00:07:06.409> gives<00:07:06.889> you<00:07:07.279> a<00:07:07.310> positive<00:07:07.639> so<00:07:08.539> those

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
negative gives you a positive so those

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.320 
negative gives you a positive so those
negatives<00:07:09.590> they<00:07:09.740> don't<00:07:09.919> just<00:07:10.129> disappear<00:07:10.339> we

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
negatives they don't just disappear we

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.089 
negatives they don't just disappear we
always<00:07:11.630> have<00:07:11.779> to<00:07:11.960> look<00:07:12.139> at<00:07:12.349> the<00:07:12.469> negatives<00:07:12.949> and

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:13.099 
always have to look at the negatives and

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.589 
always have to look at the negatives and
consider<00:07:13.550> them<00:07:13.789> but<00:07:14.389> when<00:07:14.479> you're

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
consider them but when you're

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:15.940 
consider them but when you're
multiplying<00:07:14.960> a<00:07:15.349> negative

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950 
multiplying a negative

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.250 
multiplying a negative
times<00:07:16.190> a<00:07:16.400> negative<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.270> final<00:07:17.690> result<00:07:18.080> is

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
times a negative the final result is

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.770 
times a negative the final result is
positive<00:07:18.710> so<00:07:19.640> this<00:07:19.760> would<00:07:20.030> be<00:07:20.210> our<00:07:20.240> final

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
positive so this would be our final

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.310 
positive so this would be our final
answer<00:07:20.870> 27<00:07:21.800> over<00:07:22.160> 40<00:07:22.580> positive<00:07:23.570> 27<00:07:24.110> over

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320 
answer 27 over 40 positive 27 over

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.970 
answer 27 over 40 positive 27 over
positive<00:07:25.070> 40<00:07:25.430> so<00:07:26.420> the<00:07:26.870> steps<00:07:27.140> again<00:07:27.350> you

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:27.980 
positive 40 so the steps again you

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.740 
positive 40 so the steps again you
convert<00:07:28.430> it<00:07:28.580> into<00:07:28.760> an<00:07:29.090> improper<00:07:29.720> fraction

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
convert it into an improper fraction

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.220 
convert it into an improper fraction
then<00:07:30.620> you<00:07:30.800> multiply<00:07:31.430> or<00:07:31.700> divide<00:07:31.730> using<00:07:32.690> the

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:33.230 
then you multiply or divide using the

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.050 
then you multiply or divide using the
rules<00:07:33.620> of<00:07:33.950> multiplying<00:07:34.760> and<00:07:35.030> dividing

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
rules of multiplying and dividing

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.180 
rules of multiplying and dividing
fractions<00:07:35.450> and<00:07:36.140> also<00:07:36.410> multiplying<00:07:36.950> and

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
fractions and also multiplying and

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.700 
fractions and also multiplying and
dividing<00:07:37.300> negatives<00:07:38.300> and<00:07:38.510> then<00:07:39.200> you<00:07:39.380> take<00:07:39.680> a

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:39.710 
dividing negatives and then you take a

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.870 
dividing negatives and then you take a
nap<00:07:39.980> because<00:07:40.250> those<00:07:40.550> ones<00:07:40.820> are<00:07:41.000> long<00:07:41.300> who
