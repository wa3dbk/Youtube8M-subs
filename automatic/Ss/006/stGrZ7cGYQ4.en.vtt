ingredients since it's all proportions
of<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.520> part<00:01:14.820> that's<00:01:15.060> another<00:01:15.240> question

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390

parts you have one ounce to do ounces
not<00:01:26.520> too<00:01:26.670> bad<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
not too bad so what I'm going to do is I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.149 
not too bad so what I'm going to do is I
am<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> two-ounce<00:01:31.159> measurement

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
am going to do a two-ounce measurement

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.420 
am going to do a two-ounce measurement
so<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.850> make<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.900> shots<00:01:34.340> really<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so that I can make two shots really it's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.890 
so that I can make two shots really it's
like<00:01:35.490> almost<00:01:35.790> three<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> point<00:01:36.659> but

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
like almost three at that point but

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.889 
like almost three at that point but
that's<00:01:39.900> fine<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.619> me<00:01:40.820> we're<00:01:41.820> two<00:01:42.299> ounces<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that's fine with me we're two ounces of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.190 
that's fine with me we're two ounces of
everything<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:44.600> very<00:01:45.600> good<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.899> math<00:01:46.170> so

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
everything not very good at math so

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
everything not very good at math so
having<00:01:46.920> things<00:01:47.159> being<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.610> nice<00:01:47.909> eva

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
having things being a nice eva

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.830 
having things being a nice eva
proportion<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.290> definitely<00:01:49.950> helpful<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.520> me

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
proportion is definitely helpful for me

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.459 
proportion is definitely helpful for me
