00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
something that we all do together and in

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.880 
something that we all do together and in
common<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.780> Apple<00:00:58.110> for<00:00:58.260> example<00:00:58.290> is<00:00:58.770> about

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
common so an Apple for example is about

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
common so an Apple for example is about
a<00:00:59.010> third<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> pound<00:00:59.610> so<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.240> sounds<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.990> a<00:01:01.020> lot

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
protein will help slow down digestion so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.059 
protein will help slow down digestion so
again<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.140> kind<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.319> keeps<00:02:26.560> your<00:02:26.709> insulin
