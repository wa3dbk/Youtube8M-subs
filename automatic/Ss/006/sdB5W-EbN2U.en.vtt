00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
watching this and I did him because I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.690 
watching this and I did him because I
really<00:02:48.290> wanted<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.710> make<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:49.040> commander

really wanted to make it commander

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.390 
really wanted to make it commander
Wolffe<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.810> after<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.140> painted<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.800> helmet<00:02:52.250> I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
Wolffe but after I painted the helmet I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.310 
Wolffe but after I painted the helmet I
noticed<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.180> made<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.450> commander<00:02:54.080> Wolffe

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
noticed that you made a commander Wolffe

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.710 
noticed that you made a commander Wolffe
for<00:02:54.590> your<00:02:54.800> entry<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.970> thought<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.420> should

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
for your entry and I thought and should

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.500 
for your entry and I thought and should
i<00:02:56.810> make<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.170> or<00:02:57.410> shouldn't<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.550> mean<00:02:58.790> you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
i make this or shouldn't I I mean you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.050 
i make this or shouldn't I I mean you
you<00:02:59.930> already<00:03:00.140> have<00:03:00.530> one<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:00.980> half<00:03:01.550> one<00:03:01.820> but

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you already have one and half one but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.630 
you already have one and half one but
you<00:03:02.480> will<00:03:02.570> probably<00:03:02.840> get<00:03:03.260> another<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:04.220> the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
you will probably get another of the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.390 
you will probably get another of the
Republic<00:03:05.270> attack<00:03:05.630> cruiser<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.890> think<00:03:07.220> it's

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
Republic attack cruiser I think it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.570 
Republic attack cruiser I think it's
called<00:03:07.640> Republican<00:03:08.330> Ted<00:03:08.750> Cruz<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:09.740> um<00:03:10.070> I

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
called Republican Ted Cruz but um I

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.540 
called Republican Ted Cruz but um I
thought<00:03:11.540> why<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:13.010> know<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
thought why not you know it's a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.010 
thought why not you know it's a
new--it's<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:14.120> new<00:03:14.240> commander<00:03:14.660> Wolffe<00:03:14.840> it's

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
new--it's a new commander Wolffe it's

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.840 
new--it's a new commander Wolffe it's
from<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.320> last<00:03:15.560> clone<00:03:15.860> wars<00:03:16.070> season<00:03:16.130> I<00:03:16.580> think

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
from the last clone wars season I think

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.570 
from the last clone wars season I think
not<00:03:17.060> okie<00:03:17.390> hand<00:03:17.600> but<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.989> other<00:03:18.320> thing<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
not okie hand but this other thing I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.550 
not okie hand but this other thing I
don't<00:03:20.180> know<00:03:20.480> Clone<00:03:20.780> Wars<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.260> don't<00:03:21.440> really

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
don't know Clone Wars I don't really

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.000 
don't know Clone Wars I don't really
care<00:03:21.830> but<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.610> wasn't<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.360> know<00:03:23.510> I<00:03:23.780> think<00:03:24.709> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
care but it wasn't you know I think it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.130 
care but it wasn't you know I think it
was<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.280> finale<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.630> was<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> new

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
commander Wolffe so it was the same but

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.320 
commander Wolffe so it was the same but
he<00:03:29.690> had<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> new<00:03:30.110> armory<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:32.120> now<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.989> dark
