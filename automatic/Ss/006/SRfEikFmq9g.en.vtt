00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.220
 hello I'm going to do a boxing of the 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.720
 gloves on the upper 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.920
 it was his cousin 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.920
 we see the wine 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 in one and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.970
 in one stroke 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.970
 they are the combination 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 purple orange and neon yellow good 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.910
 let's start with boxing 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.180
 sources in a bag here 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 yes 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.740
 as a glove we are going to see the palm 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.740
 of sea more than 4 millimeters 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.030
 three of I see that it 's to cushion the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.360
 ball 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.510
 the problem is a special palm for 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.940
 the water that is called way of grip 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.750
 it has a negative cut so we 're going 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.750
 to see the fingers here 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.710
 again and sliders so that the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.710
 bridge will not let you play up 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.049
 can flu the latex this one 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.049
 molded 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.940
 I put you water crisis for water 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.550
 the 34 meters was gray 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.840
 it has a rare cut and half and here it has 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.840
 a lay court 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.880
 it's already here this removes a description 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.520
 of the same text in your hand 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 let's see the back is very good more 2 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.239
 and 3 per grain wrapped place they give 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.239
 return 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.379
 and you're going to see the night here have a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.379
 space to customize 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640
 at night 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.519
 to know what a very short brooch is 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:41.019
 he says to me because he says fs perfect system 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.019
 here I put that says 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.670
 final any specialist in the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670
 goalkeeper 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.010
 it's pretty short but so patent 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.010
 the short is quite aggressive 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.540
 two 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.439
 if not 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.560
 and this is true, I hope I have 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.560
 liked
