 I would like to leave you and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.460
 video that was bad for harmonies 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
 exhale only the reasons for it were 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.910
 own reasons 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.220
 therefore, I suggest that you first remember 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 tin our so to speak competition earlier 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.950
 not a competition but a flash mob that we have 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 it is now and with years of very injuries 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.610
 let's get back to us from the most 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.040
 important concepts that was like that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.040
 amount of time back in the past video 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.360
 which is called new so air 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.780

 went to a concert mass 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.760
 this is a long-awaited concert that fell 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.650
 Yesterday, everyone knows that the content should 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.959
 take place on friday many unfortunately 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.190
 already sick very sick very much 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:33.220
 help her eat and performed on 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.840
 temperature unfortunately we are at a concert 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.450
 at the end not the hilt, the hair is roasted and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.150
 number pattern 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.250
 I was at a concert recently 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.069
 You can say so but no ordinary 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.000
 cold and friday you when and friday 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.640
 when I came home annotations killed him 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 the moment I learned that the concert is not 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 gurko same feelings just awful but 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.069
 how can you miss a concert of years she 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.590
 right there I don't know such an event on 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.660
 in fact, I know that summer is often up to 108 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.460
 comes Moscow he pressed a year ago and 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 I can not also very big 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.980
 but who knows what time it will appear 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.250
 Generally in Moscow and will be his concert yet 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.319
 so I'm getting drunk on all sorts of which 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.069
 colds wired to a concert 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.989
 three hours we have it 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 everything came for the match garden started 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.799
 concert later 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.350
 the lad consisted me as usual 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.570
 dance bar 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.970
 but hardly imagine my life 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.850
 sit and have a beautiful concert and clap 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.350
 clap your hands and it seems simple but it's not 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:42.650
 concerns should feel the music public 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.780
 then the floor will be closer to the star does not seem 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.450
 that it is very, very cool jared himself 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.640
 summer was really extraordinary 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.700
 and the concert itself was very very magical 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.970
 on application it seemed to me it seems 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.220
 that I have this very thing probably 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.420
 pretty good fan that has not been 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.700
 special yes everyone with understanding waited for the concert 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.620
 all as themselves very well led even 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.280
 funky though say the background sector 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.520
 Trinity I myself do not know produces and 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.250
 if she's a car from an oval orchestra 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.750
 those laces or I can say that but 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.510
 she is very very bad 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.900
 and I liked that before the concert 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.860
 everything was very good organism 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.930
 we took turns going very quickly 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.759
 they even opened separate entrances 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.120
 so without creating a queue of the catalog 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:37.419
 the wildest snow came down and it was just very 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.669
 it's cold outside after the concert all this 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.759
 the crowd very smoothly went to the subway such 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.539
 can you imagine that this crowd is new 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.639
 guarded by police officers followed 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.740
 order everything to be so that everything 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.770
 it was good that there were no 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.199
 problems and not get 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.590
 aren't some serious situations again 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.090
 even blocked the road to 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.800
 viewers who came to the concert they 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.810
