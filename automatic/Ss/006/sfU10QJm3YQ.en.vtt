00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
well is always covered a little bit

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.770 
well is always covered a little bit
earlier<00:00:03.000> but<00:00:03.060> now<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> show<00:00:03.689> you

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
earlier but now I'm going to show you

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.450 
earlier but now I'm going to show you
how<00:00:04.020> easy<00:00:04.350> it<00:00:04.589> is<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.890> change<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.339> your

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
how easy it is to change it on your

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.849 
how easy it is to change it on your
camera<00:00:05.670> now<00:00:06.330> my<00:00:06.450> camera<00:00:06.779> has<00:00:06.930> two<00:00:07.290> ways<00:00:07.620> that

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
camera now my camera has two ways that

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.049 
camera now my camera has two ways that
you<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.069> do<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.280> if<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
you can do it if you have it in the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.720 
you can do it if you have it in the
fully<00:00:09.269> automatic<00:00:09.750> function<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.550> really

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
fully automatic function you it really

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.759 
fully automatic function you it really
makes<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.179> simple<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
makes it simple for you it just on the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.799 
makes it simple for you it just on the
back<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:14.639> press<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.540> disk

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
back you can just press up on this disk

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.510 
back you can just press up on this disk
and<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> chooses<00:00:16.590> your<00:00:16.710> ISO<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.340> only

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and it chooses your ISO and you only

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.960 
and it chooses your ISO and you only
have<00:00:17.730> two<00:00:17.910> choices<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.960> auto<00:00:19.670> ISO<00:00:20.670> or

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have two choices you have auto ISO or

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.349 
have two choices you have auto ISO or
high<00:00:21.779> ISO<00:00:22.650> now<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> reason<00:00:23.609> that's<00:00:23.730> important

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
high ISO now the reason that's important

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.980 
high ISO now the reason that's important
is<00:00:24.480> because<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:25.350> how<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> explain<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.430> low<00:00:27.240> ISO

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
is because of how I explain how low ISO

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.910 
is because of how I explain how low ISO
and<00:00:28.380> high<00:00:28.529> ISO<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.250> work<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.650> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
and high ISO is work so if you are in a

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700 
and high ISO is work so if you are in a
dark<00:00:32.279> situation<00:00:32.899> then<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.050> know<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> need<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
dark situation then you know you need a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
dark situation then you know you need a
high<00:00:34.920> ISO<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.640> if<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> aquarium

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
high ISO so if I go back to the aquarium

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.229 
high ISO so if I go back to the aquarium
example<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> you've<00:00:38.190> turned<00:00:38.489> your<00:00:38.670> flash<00:00:38.940> off

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
example and you've turned your flash off

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.229 
example and you've turned your flash off
so<00:00:39.690> you're<00:00:39.840> shooting<00:00:40.140> through<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> glass<00:00:40.649> and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
so you're shooting through the glass and

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.060 
so you're shooting through the glass and
now<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:43.020> there's<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.500> enough<00:00:43.800> light

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
now you know there's not enough light

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
now you know there's not enough light
for<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> capture<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.059> decent<00:00:45.510> image<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
for you to capture a decent image so you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
for you to capture a decent image so you
need<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.800> turn<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> ISO<00:00:47.730> too<00:00:47.789> high<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
need to turn the ISO too high and the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
need to turn the ISO too high and the
camera<00:00:49.140> will<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.379> ahead<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> pick<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.280> nice

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
camera will go ahead and pick a nice

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
camera will go ahead and pick a nice
high<00:00:51.440> film<00:00:52.440> speed<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.719> as

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
high film speed so that it can get as

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.290 
high film speed so that it can get as
much<00:00:55.170> light<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:55.620> possible<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.610> stop<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
much light as possible and stop your

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
much light as possible and stop your
image<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.469> don't<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:58.890> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
image and so you don't have a lot of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
image and so you don't have a lot of
blurring<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.579> camera<00:01:00.030> shake<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.600> this

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
blurring or camera shake I know on this

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
blurring or camera shake I know on this
one<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.550> turn<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.940> camera<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.300> manual

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
one the if I turn my camera to manual

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.479 
one the if I turn my camera to manual
which<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.559> cameras<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
which a lot of these cameras have this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.359 
which a lot of these cameras have this
awesome<00:01:05.790> manual<00:01:06.390> function<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
awesome manual function I can just go to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.050 
awesome manual function I can just go to
here<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.600> could<00:01:10.080> move<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> manual<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.549> now

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
here I could move it to manual and now

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.590 
here I could move it to manual and now
when<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> press<00:01:12.869> ISO<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.400> choose<00:01:14.790> everything

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
when I press ISO I can choose everything

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
when I press ISO I can choose everything
from<00:01:15.960> auto<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.890> high<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> talked

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
from auto and high which we just talked

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
from auto and high which we just talked
about<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> also<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> option<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.100> a

especially if I'm shooting maybe a macro
or<00:01:44.250> very<00:01:44.490> close-up<00:01:44.939> type<00:01:45.540> image<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
or very close-up type image so it's so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
or very close-up type image so it's so
easy<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.600> great<00:01:48.750> benefit<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
easy to do and the great benefit of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
easy to do and the great benefit of
having<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.460> digital<00:01:50.939> camera<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> film

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
having a digital camera over a film

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.859 
having a digital camera over a film
camera<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> change<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.640> ISO<00:01:53.869> every

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
camera is you can change your ISO every

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.550 
camera is you can change your ISO every
single<00:01:55.259> time<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.530> take<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> picture<00:01:56.219> where

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
single time you take a picture where

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
single time you take a picture where
traditionally<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.860> would<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.670> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
traditionally you would have to use you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.410 
traditionally you would have to use you
know<00:02:00.509> 12<00:02:00.930> 24<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.619> 36<00:02:02.070> exposures<00:02:02.430> whatever<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
know 12 24 or 36 exposures whatever the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
know 12 24 or 36 exposures whatever the
role<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> film<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> bought<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:05.009> same

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
role of film is you bought at that same

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.449 
role of film is you bought at that same
film<00:02:06.240> speed<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.810> whether<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> be<00:02:07.290> 200<00:02:07.829> or<00:02:07.920> 400

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
film speed so whether it be 200 or 400

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.140 
film speed so whether it be 200 or 400
or<00:02:08.629> 100<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.110> were<00:02:10.229> sort<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:11.150> stuck

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
or 100 you were sort of you know stuck

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.890 
or 100 you were sort of you know stuck
using<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.870> film<00:02:13.170> speed

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
using that film speed

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.539 
using that film speed
so<00:02:14.019> here<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.439> great<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.250> sure<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
so here it's great so make sure you

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.979 
so here it's great so make sure you
change<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.970> when<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.150> need<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.780> it's<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
change it when you need to and it's a

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.829 
change it when you need to and it's a
great<00:02:17.170> tool<00:02:17.349> for<00:02:17.439> you<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.709> use
