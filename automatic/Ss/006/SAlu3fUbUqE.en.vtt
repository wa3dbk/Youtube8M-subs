football has brought to our University

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.390 
football has brought to our University
and<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:06.030> our<00:01:06.180> region<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.100> eagle

I<00:01:13.049> think<00:01:13.829> the<00:01:13.920> reference<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> football<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I think the reference to football is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.670 
I think the reference to football is
appropriate<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.689> football<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
appropriate because football is one of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.319 
appropriate because football is one of
the<00:01:16.740> many<00:01:16.860> things<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.640> help<00:01:17.820> us<00:01:18.000> jump

the many things that can help us jump

the many things that can help us jump
