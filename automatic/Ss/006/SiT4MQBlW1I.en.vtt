courageous enough to actually ask and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
courageous enough to actually ask and
it's<00:01:56.880> probably<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.780> embarrassing

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it's probably going to be embarrassing

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.749 
it's probably going to be embarrassing
in<00:01:58.439> fact<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.860> you're<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> middle<00:01:59.189> school<00:01:59.490> it's

in fact if you're in middle school it's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
in fact if you're in middle school it's
most<00:02:00.149> likely<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.020> embarrassing<00:02:01.560> but

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
most likely going to be embarrassing but

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
most likely going to be embarrassing but
that's<00:02:01.890> okay<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.000> life<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that's okay that's just the way life is

that's okay that's just the way life is
you<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.049> embarrassing<00:02:04.619> times<00:02:04.860> or

you have to have embarrassing times or

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.530 
you have to have embarrassing times or
you<00:02:05.369> shouldn't<00:02:05.579> let<00:02:05.700> being<00:02:05.909> embarrassed<00:02:06.299> stop

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you shouldn't let being embarrassed stop

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.760 
you shouldn't let being embarrassed stop
you<00:02:06.689> from<00:02:06.780> asking<00:02:06.960> someone<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> first

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you from asking someone in the first

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
you from asking someone in the first
place<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.190> asking<00:02:08.550> someone<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.629> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
place or asking someone again I was on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.029 
place or asking someone again I was on
the<00:02:09.810> ever<00:02:09.929> asked<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> dance<00:02:10.379> once<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.830> middle

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the ever asked to dance once in middle

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.410 
the ever asked to dance once in middle
school<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.489> think<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> way<00:02:12.090> he<00:02:12.270> did

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
school but I think that the way he did

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
school but I think that the way he did
it<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.569> actually<00:02:13.200> really<00:02:13.560> good

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it was actually really good

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.410 
it was actually really good
he<00:02:14.190> wasn't<00:02:14.340> really<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.670> guy<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.060> knew<00:02:15.270> that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
he wasn't really a guy that I knew that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.510 
he wasn't really a guy that I knew that
well<00:02:15.569> because<00:02:15.930> he<00:02:16.080> was<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> grade<00:02:16.530> below<00:02:16.680> me<00:02:16.980> but

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
well because he was a grade below me but

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.920 
well because he was a grade below me but
he<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.819> really<00:02:18.150> nice<00:02:18.360> about<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
he was just really nice about it and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.780 
he was just really nice about it and
came<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.410> said<00:02:19.650> hey<00:02:19.709> Kaitlyn<00:02:20.250> would<00:02:20.670> you

safety<00:03:18.810> mechanism<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.670> might<00:03:20.849> be

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
safety mechanism for you but it might be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.190
