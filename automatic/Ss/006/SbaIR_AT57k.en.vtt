play some like this and now we get a
dense<00:01:20.670> school<00:01:21.030> blog<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> dense<00:01:22.200> cold<00:01:22.380> walk

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
dense school blog so a dense cold walk

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
dense school blog so a dense cold walk
is<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.189> coal<00:01:23.490> blog<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.000> mean<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is just like coal blog I mean but it's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.190 
is just like coal blog I mean but it's
even<00:01:25.140> more<00:01:25.290> compact<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> storage<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.900> we're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
even more compact and storage so we're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
even more compact and storage so we're
going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> keep<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> our<00:01:28.890> inventory<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to keep that in our inventory and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.399 
going to keep that in our inventory and
we're<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> keep<00:01:30.750> one<00:01:30.960> regular

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
we're also going to keep one regular

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.980 
we're also going to keep one regular
cold<00:01:31.680> walk<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> inventory<00:01:32.540> just<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.720> later

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
cold walk in inventory just for later

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.240 
cold walk in inventory just for later
demonstrations<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.770> we're<00:01:37.920> done<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
demonstrations so we're done with the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.990 
demonstrations so we're done with the
coal<00:01:38.430> now<00:01:38.610> now<00:01:39.079> we're<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> make<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
coal now now we're going to make a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.630 
coal now now we're going to make a
redstone<00:01:42.000> block<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.130> works<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> same<00:01:44.460> way

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
redstone block and it works the same way

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.969 
redstone block and it works the same way
just<00:01:45.000> nine<00:01:45.210> walks<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> red<00:01:45.630> stone<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
just nine walks the red stone and the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.590 
just nine walks the red stone and the
textures<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.700> nice<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
textures are really nice i like them and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.230 
textures are really nice i like them and
it<00:01:48.750> lights<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.259> illuminating<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it lights it's illuminating so it you

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.789 
it lights it's illuminating so it you
can<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.320> replacement<00:01:52.530> for

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
can use this as a replacement for

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
can use this as a replacement for
glowstone<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.430> jack<00:01:53.579> o<00:01:53.610> lanterns<00:01:53.970> or<00:01:54.060> whatever

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
glowstone or jack o lanterns or whatever

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.090 
glowstone or jack o lanterns or whatever
so<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:56.659> eight<00:01:57.659> more

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
so now we're going to make eight more

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.720 
so now we're going to make eight more
redstone<00:01:59.100> blocks

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.760 

so<00:02:05.730> let<00:02:06.030> me<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.300> lay<00:02:07.050> out<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.260> red<00:02:07.380> stone<00:02:07.590> for

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so let me just lay out the red stone for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.160 
so let me just lay out the red stone for
this<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:11.210> we<00:02:12.210> have<00:02:12.390> our<00:02:12.570> nine<00:02:12.750> read<00:02:12.930> some

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this and we have our nine read some

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.430 
this and we have our nine read some
books<00:02:13.850> now<00:02:14.850> with<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
books now with these you can make a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.020 
books now with these you can make a
dancer<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.770> block<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> we're<00:02:20.910> also

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
dancer it's not block and we're also

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.640 
dancer it's not block and we're also
going<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.270> make<00:02:21.450> one<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.990> redstone<00:02:22.260> block

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
going to make one more redstone block

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.470 
going to make one more redstone block
just<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.220> our<00:02:24.180> purposes<00:02:24.570> here<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:27.180> second

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
dense coal block in here and we're going

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.930 
dense coal block in here and we're going
to<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.070> we're<00:03:02.220> going<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.400> put<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.550> dense<00:03:02.730> cold

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.330 
to so we're going to put a dense cold
walk<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.720> we're<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.050> smelt<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.840 

we're<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.520> get<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:12.980> diamond<00:03:13.980> we're<00:03:14.670> going

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
we're going to get a diamond we're going

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:26.000 
we're going to get a diamond we're going
to<00:03:14.910> put<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.239> redstone<00:03:15.480> block<00:03:15.810> in<00:03:24.770> I'm<00:03:25.770> going<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
to put a redstone block in I'm going to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
to put a redstone block in I'm going to
get<00:03:26.100> three<00:03:26.250> damage<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.000> that's<00:03:27.209> how<00:03:27.330> those

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
get three damage so that's how those

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.690 
get three damage so that's how those
work<00:03:27.720> now<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.920> other<00:03:29.040> thing<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.580> do

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
work now the other thing that you can do

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.320 
work now the other thing that you can do
is<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:30.300> making<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.540> different<00:03:30.810> furnace<00:03:31.080> here

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
is I'm making a different furnace here

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.479 
is I'm making a different furnace here
let<00:03:33.330> me<00:03:33.390> get<00:03:33.480> something<00:03:33.690> smells<00:03:34.310> let's<00:03:35.310> just

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
let me get something smells let's just

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.290 
let me get something smells let's just
take<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:36.330> example<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:37.650> cobblestone<00:03:38.209> if<00:03:39.209> you

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
take for example some cobblestone if you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.170 
take for example some cobblestone if you
put<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.920> coal<00:03:40.920> block<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> bottom<00:03:41.580> but

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
put a coal block in the bottom but

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
put a coal block in the bottom but
cobblestone<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.350> coal<00:03:43.680> block<00:03:44.010> will<00:03:44.430> last<00:03:44.640> for

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
cobblestone the coal block will last for

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.930 
cobblestone the coal block will last for
64<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.530> coal<00:03:46.860> block<00:03:47.160> will<00:03:47.430> smelt<00:03:47.730> this

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
64 so one coal block will smelt this

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
64 so one coal block will smelt this
entire<00:03:48.390> its<00:03:48.630> cobblestone<00:03:49.019> which<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.800> pretty

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
entire its cobblestone which is pretty

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.370 
entire its cobblestone which is pretty
cool<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.180> also<00:03:51.390> not<00:03:51.690> as<00:03:51.930> worth<00:03:52.200> it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
cool but it's also not as worth it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.890 
cool but it's also not as worth it
because<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:53.070> eight<00:03:53.280> coal<00:03:53.660> right<00:03:54.660> now<00:03:54.840> you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
because with eight coal right now you

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.530 
because with eight coal right now you
can<00:03:55.230> smell<00:03:55.440> an<00:03:55.709> entire<00:03:56.190> stack<00:03:56.550> whereas<00:03:57.510> with

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
can smell an entire stack whereas with

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.199 
can smell an entire stack whereas with
nine<00:03:58.019> Cole<00:03:58.320> you're<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.739> get<00:03:58.860> a

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
nine Cole you're going to get a

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.050 
nine Cole you're going to get a
cobblestone<00:04:00.500> an<00:04:01.500> entire<00:04:01.800> sex<00:04:02.100> Melton<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:02.940> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
cobblestone an entire sex Melton so it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.280 
cobblestone an entire sex Melton so it
is<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.330> worth<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.930> use<00:04:04.080> eight

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
is more worth it just to use eight

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.870 
is more worth it just to use eight
individual<00:04:04.830> cool<00:04:05.010> pieces<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.670> just

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
individual cool pieces but it's just

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880 
individual cool pieces but it's just
kind<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.090> cool<00:04:06.360> how<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.110> runs<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.709> same

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
kind of cool how it runs on the same

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.410 
kind of cool how it runs on the same
fuel<00:04:08.190> sources<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.060> entire<00:04:09.239> time<00:04:11.420> now

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
fuel sources for that entire time now

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.280 
fuel sources for that entire time now
next<00:04:13.820> we're<00:04:14.820> going<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:14.970> use<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.480> redstone<00:04:16.019> block

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
next we're going to use a redstone block

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.119 
next we're going to use a redstone block
of<00:04:16.440> Steel

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:17.129 
of Steel

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.499 
of Steel
now<00:04:18.129> redstone<00:04:18.579> block<00:04:18.819> is<00:04:19.060> actually<00:04:19.449> very

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
now redstone block is actually very

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.029 
now redstone block is actually very
useful<00:04:20.109> but<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.069> also<00:04:21.310> kind<00:04:21.819> of<00:04:22.650> tedious<00:04:23.650> I

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
useful but it's also kind of tedious I

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.339 
useful but it's also kind of tedious I
guess<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.610> could<00:04:24.639> say<00:04:24.879> it<00:04:24.970> points<00:04:25.240> because<00:04:26.080> a

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
guess you could say it points because a

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.950 
guess you could say it points because a
redstone<00:04:26.770> block<00:04:27.069> will<00:04:27.250> smell<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.699> sex<00:04:28.060> so<00:04:28.719> once

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
redstone block will smell to sex so once

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.119 
redstone block will smell to sex so once
the<00:04:29.080> stack<00:04:29.289> is<00:04:29.439> done<00:04:29.680> you're<00:04:29.860> gonna<00:04:29.919> have<00:04:30.069> to

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
the stack is done you're gonna have to

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.369 
the stack is done you're gonna have to
put<00:04:30.250> another<00:04:30.340> one<00:04:30.580> right<00:04:30.639> away<00:04:30.819> so<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:31.780> mean<00:04:32.169> it

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
put another one right away so I mean it

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.770 
put another one right away so I mean it
could<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.860> waste<00:04:33.069> of<00:04:33.189> fuel<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.699> couldn't<00:04:34.060> not

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
could be a waste of fuel it couldn't not

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.409 
could be a waste of fuel it couldn't not
but<00:04:35.259> I<00:04:35.289> mean<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.800> wouldn't<00:04:36.699> recommend<00:04:37.000> using<00:04:37.270> it

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
but I mean I wouldn't recommend using it

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.059 
but I mean I wouldn't recommend using it
as<00:04:37.509> much<00:04:37.689> as<00:04:37.930> just<00:04:38.259> regular<00:04:38.650> coal<00:04:38.889> and

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
as much as just regular coal and

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.149 
as much as just regular coal and
redstone<00:04:39.310> blocks<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:40.710> finally<00:04:41.710> we're<00:04:42.099> going

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
redstone blocks and finally we're going

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.809 
redstone blocks and finally we're going
to<00:04:42.280> use<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:43.110> dense<00:04:44.110> coal<00:04:44.650> block<00:04:44.889> so<00:04:45.400> let<00:04:45.580> me<00:04:45.610> just

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
to use a dense coal block so let me just

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.249 
to use a dense coal block so let me just
spawn<00:04:46.030> one<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:46.300> real<00:04:46.479> quick<00:04:46.629> because<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:47.050> don't

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
spawn one in real quick because I don't

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.499 
spawn one in real quick because I don't
want<00:04:47.409> to<00:04:47.469> make<00:04:47.560> one<00:04:50.129> where<00:04:51.129> are<00:04:51.219> you<00:04:51.509> against

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
want to make one where are you against

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.689 
want to make one where are you against
coal<00:04:52.750> block<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.830> put<00:04:54.129> a<00:04:54.159> dense<00:04:54.400> coal

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
coal block and you put a dense coal

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:59.969 
coal block and you put a dense coal
block<00:04:54.909> in<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:57.090> you're<00:04:58.090> going<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.509> get<00:04:58.979> see

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
block in and you're going to get see

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.600 
block in and you're going to get see
let's<00:05:00.190> take<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:01.919> dense<00:05:02.919> coal<00:05:03.190> block<00:05:03.400> will

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
let's take a dense coal block will

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.719 
let's take a dense coal block will
smells<00:05:03.879> for<00:05:04.409> 576<00:05:05.409> uses<00:05:05.800> so<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:06.610> just

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
smells for 576 uses so this is just

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.999 
smells for 576 uses so this is just
insane<00:05:06.969> guys<00:05:07.599> a<00:05:07.870> dense<00:05:08.379> coal<00:05:08.680> block<00:05:08.860> will

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
insane guys a dense coal block will

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.369 
insane guys a dense coal block will
smell<00:05:09.190> for<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.580> long<00:05:09.789> but<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.779> problem<00:05:11.020> is

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
smell for so long but the problem is

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.200 
smell for so long but the problem is
that<00:05:11.409> you<00:05:11.800> can't<00:05:11.830> stack<00:05:12.310> more<00:05:12.550> than<00:05:12.669> 64<00:05:13.120> is

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that you can't stack more than 64 is

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.790 
that you can't stack more than 64 is
you're<00:05:13.300> gonna<00:05:13.360> have<00:05:13.509> to<00:05:13.599> have<00:05:13.870> 64<00:05:14.379> smelted

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
you're gonna have to have 64 smelted

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.679 
you're gonna have to have 64 smelted
take<00:05:15.189> it<00:05:15.310> out<00:05:15.430> put<00:05:15.460> more<00:05:15.879> in<00:05:16.029> and<00:05:16.270> you're<00:05:16.599> gonna

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
take it out put more in and you're gonna

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.140 
take it out put more in and you're gonna
have<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:16.930> keep<00:05:17.080> watching<00:05:17.229> it<00:05:17.669> but<00:05:18.669> then<00:05:19.120> again

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
have to keep watching it but then again

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.290 
have to keep watching it but then again
it<00:05:19.719> is<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.930> great<00:05:20.319> use<00:05:20.439> of<00:05:20.469> fuel<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.300> the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
it is a great use of fuel and the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.969 
it is a great use of fuel and the
Diamonds<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:23.080> you<00:05:23.199> can<00:05:23.319> get<00:05:23.409> also<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.740> lot<00:05:23.889> of
