in<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.070> we'll<00:00:02.460> start<00:00:02.909> by<00:00:03.090> talking

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
in this video we'll start by talking

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.240 
in this video we'll start by talking
about<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.929> rectangular<00:00:04.410> form<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.890> complex

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
about the rectangular form of complex

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.740 
about the rectangular form of complex
number<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> rectangular<00:00:06.299> form<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.720> a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
number and the rectangular form of a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.960 
number and the rectangular form of a
complex<00:00:06.960> number<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.620> one<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.340> three<00:00:08.730> ways<00:00:08.910> that

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
complex number is one of three ways that

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
complex number is one of three ways that
we're<00:00:09.450> going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.630> express<00:00:09.960> complex<00:00:10.230> numbers

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
we're going to express complex numbers

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.660 
we're going to express complex numbers
where<00:00:11.519> Tangela<00:00:11.910> form<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.420> made<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.110> of

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
where Tangela form is made up of

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.770 
where Tangela form is made up of
something<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.759> looks<00:00:14.969> like<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.299> up<00:00:15.450> here<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
something that looks like this up here a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.550 
something that looks like this up here a
plus<00:00:16.109> B<00:00:16.379> J<00:00:16.680> where<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.390> real<00:00:18.539> number<00:00:19.080> part

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
plus B J where a is a real number part

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.500 
plus B J where a is a real number part
and<00:00:21.350> BJ<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.650> referred<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.090> imaginary

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
and BJ is referred to as the imaginary

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439 
and BJ is referred to as the imaginary
part<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.460> pure<00:00:26.460> imaginary<00:00:26.910> number<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.420> she

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
part a pure imaginary number where she

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.540 
part a pure imaginary number where she
talks<00:00:27.750> about<00:00:27.810> down<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
talks about down here is when the a is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
talks about down here is when the a is
equal<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> zero<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> BJ<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
equal to zero so we just have the BJ a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
equal to zero so we just have the BJ a
and<00:00:32.520> B<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:32.969> real<00:00:33.270> number<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.079> end<00:00:34.230> up

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
and B here are real number so we end up

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.590 
and B here are real number so we end up
with<00:00:34.590> things<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.270> we<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.450> down

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
with things that look like we see down

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
with things that look like we see down
here<00:00:36.660> further<00:00:37.050> three<00:00:38.040> minus<00:00:38.460> 2j<00:00:38.910> negative<00:00:39.510> two

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
here further three minus 2j negative two

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.250 
here further three minus 2j negative two
plus<00:00:39.870> five<00:00:40.170> J<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.860> things<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.260> we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
plus five J and things like that we

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
plus five J and things like that we
compare<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.860> complex<00:00:44.370> numbers<00:00:44.430> by<00:00:44.789> comparing

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
compare two complex numbers by comparing

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.660 
compare two complex numbers by comparing
their<00:00:46.020> real<00:00:46.410> number<00:00:46.710> parts<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.309> case<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
their real number parts in this case a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.779 
their real number parts in this case a
with<00:00:48.120> X<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.340> B<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.700> y<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.379> equal

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
with X and B with y if those are equal

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.319 
with X and B with y if those are equal
then<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.210> complex<00:00:54.539> numbers<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.930> equal<00:00:56.329> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
then the complex numbers are equal the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
then the complex numbers are equal the
conjugate<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> complex<00:00:58.199> number<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
conjugate of a complex number is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
conjugate of a complex number is
something<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.940> gonna<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.600> use

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
something that we are gonna have to use

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.700 
something that we are gonna have to use
periodically<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.219> conjugate<00:01:02.579> refers<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
periodically and the conjugate refers to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.190 
periodically and the conjugate refers to
changing<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> sign<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> imaginary

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
changing the sign of the imaginary

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
changing the sign of the imaginary
portion<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.830> complex<00:01:08.220> number<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
portion of the complex number so in this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.530 
portion of the complex number so in this
instance<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:10.020> plus<00:01:10.560> B<00:01:10.890> J<00:01:11.159> would<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.000> conjugate

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
instance a plus B J would the conjugate

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.499 
instance a plus B J would the conjugate
is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.930> minus<00:01:13.530> B<00:01:13.710> J<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.400> only<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.939> imaginary

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is a minus B J so only the imaginary

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
is a minus B J so only the imaginary
part<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> changed<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.860> first<00:01:17.130> example

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
part is changed in this first example

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
part is changed in this first example
that<00:01:17.729> we're<00:01:17.820> gonna<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that we're gonna do here we just want to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.929 
that we're gonna do here we just want to
find<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> conjugate<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> each<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
find the conjugate of each of the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
find the conjugate of each of the
following<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> conjugate<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.890> 3<00:01:23.700> minus<00:01:24.450> 2

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
following so the conjugate of 3 minus 2

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.850 
following so the conjugate of 3 minus 2
J<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:24.930> 3<00:01:25.650> plus<00:01:26.159> 2<00:01:26.490> J<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.780> conjugate<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.259> minus<00:01:28.680> 2

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
J is 3 plus 2 J the conjugate of minus 2

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
J is 3 plus 2 J the conjugate of minus 2
plus<00:01:29.189> 5<00:01:29.400> J<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.030> minus<00:01:30.840> 2<00:01:31.170> minus<00:01:31.710> 5<00:01:32.189> J<00:01:32.520> notice

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
plus 5 J is minus 2 minus 5 J notice

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.560 
plus 5 J is minus 2 minus 5 J notice
only<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.020> imaginary<00:01:34.740> term<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.100> changing<00:01:35.570> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
only the imaginary term is changing the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
only the imaginary term is changing the
conjugate<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> 6<00:01:37.920> J<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.400> minus<00:01:38.880> 6<00:01:39.119> J<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
conjugate of 6 J is minus 6 J and the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.740 
conjugate of 6 J is minus 6 J and the
way<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.850> about<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> would

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
way to think about that would this would

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.740 
way to think about that would this would
have<00:01:42.840> been<00:01:42.899> 0<00:01:43.259> plus<00:01:43.829> 6<00:01:44.189> J<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.880> 0<00:01:45.119> minus<00:01:45.540> 6

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have been 0 plus 6 J now it's 0 minus 6

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
have been 0 plus 6 J now it's 0 minus 6
Jane<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.439> again<00:01:46.680> only<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.159> imaginary<00:01:47.670> part<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
Jane so again only the imaginary part is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
Jane so again only the imaginary part is
changing<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.049> conjugate<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> 3<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.250> 3<00:01:51.500> again

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
changing the conjugate of 3 is 3 again

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.789 
changing the conjugate of 3 is 3 again
how<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> 0<00:01:54.049> are<00:01:55.049> 3<00:01:55.409> plus

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
how do we think about that 0 are 3 plus

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.230 
how do we think about that 0 are 3 plus
0<00:01:56.670> J<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.540> 3<00:01:57.930> minus<00:01:58.619> 0<00:01:58.829> J<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
0 J is now 3 minus 0 J we don't need to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.920 
0 J is now 3 minus 0 J we don't need to
worry<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.659> 0<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> 3

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
worry about the 0 so we just have the 3

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.810 
worry about the 0 so we just have the 3
the<00:02:03.930> purple<00:02:04.320> box<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.890> shows<00:02:04.920> us<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> very

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the purple box here shows us a very

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.109 
the purple box here shows us a very
important<00:02:06.390> rule<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.259> statement

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
important rule or statement

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
important rule or statement
we've<00:02:09.690> used<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.200> extensively<00:02:10.560> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
we've used this extensively in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.309 
we've used this extensively in
simplifying<00:02:11.459> radicals<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.840> root<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.170> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
simplifying radicals that the root of a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.930 
simplifying radicals that the root of a
time's<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> root<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.099> B<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.610> root<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.819> a

positive values it is not true if both
numbers<00:02:23.910> are<00:02:24.330> negative<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.709> does<00:02:25.980> apply<00:02:26.340> if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
numbers are negative it does apply if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
numbers are negative it does apply if
one<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:27.000> negative<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.599> positive<00:02:27.690> but

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
one is negative and one is positive but

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.220 
one is negative and one is positive but
we<00:02:28.680> cannot<00:02:29.459> use<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.209> rule<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.690> both<00:02:31.049> are

we cannot use the rule if both are

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.100 
we cannot use the rule if both are
negative<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:33.060> get<00:02:33.239> around<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.959> don't

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
negative to get around this so we don't

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.080 
negative to get around this so we don't
have<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.349> worry<00:02:34.530> about<00:02:34.680> oh<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.670> put<00:02:36.030> them

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
have to worry about oh can we put them

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059 
have to worry about oh can we put them
together<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.599> not<00:02:36.780> put<00:02:36.930> them<00:02:37.019> together<00:02:37.110> we

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
together can we not put them together we

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.009 
together can we not put them together we
recommend<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.670> simplify<00:02:39.150> everything<00:02:39.660> -<00:02:39.780> J

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
recommend you simplify everything - J

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.380 
recommend you simplify everything - J
first<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.280> reduce<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.000> much<00:02:42.030> as<00:02:42.269> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
first if you reduce it as much as you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
first if you reduce it as much as you
can<00:02:42.599> before<00:02:42.900> doing<00:02:43.349> any<00:02:43.590> other<00:02:43.680> operations

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
can before doing any other operations

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.520 
can before doing any other operations
you<00:02:44.640> won't<00:02:45.450> run<00:02:45.569> into<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.930> problem<00:02:45.989> at<00:02:46.380> all

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you won't run into this problem at all

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.370 
you won't run into this problem at all
so<00:02:47.400> in<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.730> instance<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.420> would<00:02:49.140> simply

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so in this instance we would simply

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.759 
so in this instance we would simply
write<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.380> 2<00:02:52.380> J<00:02:53.299> remember<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:55.319> negative

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
write this is 2 J remember the negative

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.789 
write this is 2 J remember the negative
gives<00:02:56.400> us<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.760> J<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.569> 4<00:02:57.870> square<00:02:58.230> root<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.500> 2

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
gives us the J the 4 square root is 2

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.039 
gives us the J the 4 square root is 2
and<00:02:59.040> now<00:02:59.879> we<00:02:59.940> square<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:00.900> have

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and now we square it now we don't have

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.809 
and now we square it now we don't have
to<00:03:01.230> worry<00:03:01.440> about<00:03:01.530> what<00:03:02.099> rules<00:03:02.340> were<00:03:02.489> applying

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
to worry about what rules were applying

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.800 
to worry about what rules were applying
so<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:04.079> 4<00:03:04.560> J<00:03:05.190> squared<00:03:05.700> J<00:03:06.360> squared<00:03:06.660> is

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
so this is 4 J squared J squared is

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.220 
so this is 4 J squared J squared is
minus<00:03:07.110> 1<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.650> minus<00:03:07.680> 4<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.510> square<00:03:09.959> root<00:03:10.079> of

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
minus 1 so minus 4 the square root of

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.500 
minus 1 so minus 4 the square root of
negative<00:03:10.379> 2<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.040> square<00:03:11.790> root<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.970> negative<00:03:12.090> 6

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
negative 2 and square root of negative 6

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.530 
negative 2 and square root of negative 6
what<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.200> cannot<00:03:13.889> do<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.549> multiply<00:03:15.180> those

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
what you cannot do is multiply those

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.660 
what you cannot do is multiply those
together<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.250> would<00:03:17.340> give<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.609> the

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
together and that would give you the

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.449 
together and that would give you the
square<00:03:17.940> root<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.150> positive<00:03:18.420> 12<00:03:19.049> which<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.040> not

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
square root of positive 12 which is not

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.729 
square root of positive 12 which is not
the<00:03:20.730> correct<00:03:21.030> answer<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:22.260> case<00:03:22.530> we're

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
the correct answer in this case we're

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.150 
the correct answer in this case we're
gonna<00:03:22.799> say<00:03:23.069> first<00:03:23.310> well<00:03:23.609> that's<00:03:23.819> 2<00:03:24.349> or<00:03:25.349> J<00:03:25.859> root

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
gonna say first well that's 2 or J root

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.000 
gonna say first well that's 2 or J root
2<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:27.150> can't<00:03:27.389> reduce<00:03:27.510> 2<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.700> J<00:03:30.030> root<00:03:30.359> 6

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
2 we can't reduce 2 and this is J root 6

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.039 
2 we can't reduce 2 and this is J root 6
once<00:03:32.010> we<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.310> j<00:03:32.639> times<00:03:32.940> root<00:03:33.180> 2<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.569> J<00:03:33.720> times

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
once we have j times root 2 and J times

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:34.759 
once we have j times root 2 and J times
root<00:03:34.290> 6

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
root 6

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.610 
root 6
now<00:03:35.489> that<00:03:35.760> 2<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.329> 6<00:03:36.480> are<00:03:36.630> positive<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.349> can<00:03:37.380> put

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
now that 2 and 6 are positive we can put

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.990 
now that 2 and 6 are positive we can put
those<00:03:37.709> together<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.400> end<00:03:38.519> up<00:03:38.579> with<00:03:38.760> J

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
those together and we end up with J

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.680 
those together and we end up with J
squared<00:03:39.590> times<00:03:40.590> root<00:03:40.829> 12<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.690> simplifying

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
squared times root 12 and simplifying

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.170 
squared times root 12 and simplifying
more<00:03:42.959> J<00:03:43.230> squared<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> minus<00:03:44.099> 1<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.609> negative

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
more J squared is minus 1 so negative

attention to where the squared is it's

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.520 
attention to where the squared is it's
actually<00:03:56.310> asking<00:03:56.790> us<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.090> square<00:03:57.389> negative<00:03:57.599> 7

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
actually asking us to square negative 7

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.409 
actually asking us to square negative 7
first<00:03:58.889> and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.579> take<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.970> square<00:04:00.090> root

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
first and then take the square root

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.940 
first and then take the square root
which<00:04:00.690> means<00:04:00.750> really<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.769> square

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
which means really that's the square

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.080 
which means really that's the square
root<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.220> 49<00:04:03.169> negative<00:04:04.169> 7<00:04:04.410> squared<00:04:04.530> which<00:04:05.090> is

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
root of 49 negative 7 squared which is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.699 
root of 49 negative 7 squared which is
simply<00:04:06.989> 7<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> final<00:04:09.930> one<00:04:10.049> here<00:04:10.290> again

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
simply 7 and in the final one here again

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.430 
simply 7 and in the final one here again
order<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.370> operations<00:04:11.970> first<00:04:12.359> so<00:04:13.169> we're<00:04:13.349> gonna

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
order of operations first so we're gonna

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.129 
order of operations first so we're gonna
leave<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:14.370> square<00:04:14.549> root<00:04:14.880> we're<00:04:15.690> gonna<00:04:15.780> leave

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
leave the square root we're gonna leave

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.159 
leave the square root we're gonna leave
the<00:04:16.620> squared<00:04:17.099> we're<00:04:17.820> gonna<00:04:17.940> work<00:04:18.090> inside<00:04:18.510> so

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
the squared we're gonna work inside so

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.490 
the squared we're gonna work inside so
negative<00:04:19.590> 2<00:04:19.769> squared<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.400> 4<00:04:21.049> times<00:04:22.049> negative<00:04:22.260> 4

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
negative 2 squared is 4 times negative 4

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.910 
negative 2 squared is 4 times negative 4
is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
is

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.260 
is
negative<00:04:23.550> 16<00:04:24.090> negative<00:04:25.550> 16<00:04:26.550> under<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> root

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
negative 16 negative 16 under a root

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:35.110 
negative 16 negative 16 under a root
means<00:04:28.490> for<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:30.170> or<00:04:31.170> J<00:04:31.470> all<00:04:32.100> squared<00:04:33.530> which<00:04:34.530> means

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
means for I or J all squared which means

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.930 
means for I or J all squared which means
negative<00:04:36.120> 16<00:04:36.930> J<00:04:37.860> squared<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.430> negative<00:04:38.550> 1

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
negative 16 J squared is negative 1

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.420 
negative 16 J squared is negative 1
there's<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.660> negative<00:04:39.840> 4<00:04:40.620> square<00:04:40.890> root<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.040> 16

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
there's the negative 4 square root of 16

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.390 
there's the negative 4 square root of 16
so<00:04:41.670> there<00:04:41.820> 16<00:04:42.530> was<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.740> more<00:04:43.890> example<00:04:44.310> of

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
so there 16 was just a more example of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.390 
so there 16 was just a more example of
simplifying<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.240> roots<00:04:45.510> with<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.840> negatives

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
simplifying the roots with the negatives

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.010 
simplifying the roots with the negatives
we<00:04:47.400> can<00:04:47.550> also<00:04:47.670> do<00:04:47.940> some<00:04:48.090> basic<00:04:48.120> operations

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
we can also do some basic operations

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.150 
we can also do some basic operations
with<00:04:49.170> complex<00:04:49.560> numbers

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
with complex numbers

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.940 
with complex numbers
adding<00:04:50.790> subtracting<00:04:50.970> multiplying<00:04:51.750> dividing

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
adding subtracting multiplying dividing

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.620 
adding subtracting multiplying dividing
when<00:04:52.950> we<00:04:53.130> learn<00:04:53.310> about<00:04:53.340> some<00:04:53.940> more<00:04:54.120> forms<00:04:54.510> of

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
when we learn about some more forms of

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.810 
when we learn about some more forms of
complex<00:04:55.050> numbers<00:04:55.380> polar<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.280> exponential

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.790 
complex numbers polar and exponential
specifically<00:04:57.510> we're<00:04:58.170> gonna<00:04:58.230> see<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.650> for

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
specifically we're gonna see that for

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.110 
specifically we're gonna see that for
multiplication<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.430> division<00:04:59.820> those<00:04:59.970> are

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
multiplication and division those are

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.910 
multiplication and division those are
actually<00:05:00.420> better<00:05:00.630> for<00:05:00.930> addition<00:05:01.890> and

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
actually better for addition and

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.370 
actually better for addition and
subtraction<00:05:02.810> rectangular<00:05:03.810> form<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.170> the<00:05:04.230> only

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
subtraction rectangular form is the only

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
form that we use what we want to be

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.030 
form that we use what we want to be
careful<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.440> when<00:05:07.620> we're<00:05:07.740> doing<00:05:07.920> these

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
careful of when we're doing these

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.560 
careful of when we're doing these
examples<00:05:08.580> is<00:05:08.820> first<00:05:10.100> simplify<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:12.030> radicals

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
examples is first simplify the radicals

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.700 
examples is first simplify the radicals
as<00:05:12.750> much<00:05:13.140> as<00:05:13.380> possible<00:05:13.850> what<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.060> means<00:05:15.300> is

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
as much as possible what that means is

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.340 
as much as possible what that means is
we<00:05:16.710> want<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:16.980> get<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.550> J<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.180> there<00:05:18.480> if<00:05:18.720> we<00:05:19.140> need

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
we want to get the J in there if we need

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.510 
we want to get the J in there if we need
it<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:19.890> reduce<00:05:20.430> things<00:05:20.910> as<00:05:21.060> much<00:05:21.210> as<00:05:21.390> we<00:05:21.510> can

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
it and reduce things as much as we can

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.370 
it and reduce things as much as we can
that<00:05:23.520> will<00:05:23.790> prevent<00:05:24.240> any<00:05:24.600> of<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:24.960> errors<00:05:25.350> that

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
that will prevent any of the errors that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.010 
that will prevent any of the errors that
could<00:05:25.740> occur<00:05:26.070> with<00:05:26.510> using<00:05:27.510> some<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.870> rules

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
could occur with using some of the rules

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.810 
could occur with using some of the rules
for<00:05:28.200> radicals<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.710> only<00:05:28.860> apply<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.250> positive

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
for radicals that only apply to positive

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.420 
for radicals that only apply to positive
so<00:05:30.060> again<00:05:30.330> when<00:05:30.540> you<00:05:30.600> start<00:05:30.720> these<00:05:30.990> questions

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
so again when you start these questions

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.010 
so again when you start these questions
reduce<00:05:32.430> as<00:05:32.760> much<00:05:32.910> as<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:33.150> can<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.510> radicals

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
reduce as much as you can the radicals

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.350 
reduce as much as you can the radicals
take<00:05:34.590> care<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.100> negative<00:05:35.460> under<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.090> roof

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
take care of the negative under the roof

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.500 
take care of the negative under the roof
then<00:05:37.170> start<00:05:37.620> following<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.040> rules<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:39.330> for

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
then start following the rules so for

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.270 
then start following the rules so for
addition<00:05:39.810> subtraction<00:05:39.980> we're<00:05:40.980> just<00:05:41.130> going<00:05:41.250> to

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
addition subtraction we're just going to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.680 
addition subtraction we're just going to
do<00:05:41.400> addition<00:05:41.760> subtraction<00:05:41.820> like<00:05:42.390> we<00:05:42.540> would

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
do addition subtraction like we would

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.170 
do addition subtraction like we would
normally<00:05:43.400> any<00:05:44.400> algebraic<00:05:45.030> addition

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
normally any algebraic addition

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.030 
normally any algebraic addition

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
subtraction put the real parts together

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.440 
subtraction put the real parts together
put<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.640> imaginary<00:05:48.090> parts<00:05:48.330> together

simplify<00:05:49.200> as<00:05:49.320> much<00:05:49.380> as<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:49.710> can

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
simplify as much as you can

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.420 
simplify as much as you can
multiplication<00:05:51.230> again<00:05:52.230> exactly<00:05:53.160> as<00:05:53.250> we'd

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
if J was simply an X simplify at the end

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.640 
if J was simply an X simplify at the end
and<00:06:00.510> that's<00:06:00.570> going<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:00.990> be<00:06:01.110> important<00:06:01.590> because

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
and that's going to be important because

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.690 
finally division we want to use the
conjugate<00:06:09.480> and<00:06:09.980> the<00:06:10.980> conjugate<00:06:11.430> we<00:06:11.550> should

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
conjugate and the conjugate we should

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.440 
conjugate and the conjugate we should
know<00:06:11.850> we<00:06:12.090> change<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:13.670> imaginary<00:06:14.670> sign<00:06:15.030> or<00:06:15.390> the

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
know we change the imaginary sign or the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.660 
know we change the imaginary sign or the
sign<00:06:15.780> of<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.020> imaginary<00:06:16.110> term<00:06:16.770> so<00:06:17.550> we're

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
sign of the imaginary term so we're

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.980 
sign of the imaginary term so we're
going<00:06:17.760> to<00:06:17.820> multiply<00:06:17.970> top<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:18.510> bottom<00:06:18.690> by<00:06:18.960> the

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
going to multiply top and bottom by the

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.600 
going to multiply top and bottom by the
conjugate<00:06:19.260> when<00:06:20.010> we<00:06:20.160> want<00:06:20.310> to<00:06:20.400> rationalize

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
conjugate when we want to rationalize

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.670 
conjugate when we want to rationalize
denominators<00:06:21.590> which<00:06:22.590> is<00:06:22.740> division<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:24.300> you

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
denominators which is division so you

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.230 
denominators which is division so you
should<00:06:25.680> be<00:06:25.800> able<00:06:25.950> to<00:06:26.130> do<00:06:26.460> these<00:06:26.610> examples<00:06:27.150> if

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
should be able to do these examples if

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.390 
should be able to do these examples if
you<00:06:27.300> want<00:06:27.480> to<00:06:27.570> pause<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:28.020> video<00:06:28.140> and<00:06:28.590> make

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
you want to pause the video and make

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.820 
you want to pause the video and make
sure<00:06:29.430> you<00:06:29.580> can<00:06:29.790> work<00:06:29.970> them<00:06:30.180> all<00:06:30.240> out<00:06:30.650> I'm<00:06:31.650> not

just<00:06:51.300> as<00:06:51.419> a<00:06:51.449> recap<00:06:51.689> remember<00:06:52.310> when<00:06:53.310> we're

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
just as a recap remember when we're

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.089 
just as a recap remember when we're
adding<00:06:53.759> subtracting<00:06:53.909> like<00:06:54.360> see<00:06:54.840> real<00:06:55.770> numbers

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
adding subtracting like see real numbers

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.499 
adding subtracting like see real numbers
together<00:06:56.250> imaginary<00:06:57.180> numbers<00:06:57.360> together

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
together imaginary numbers together

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.790 
together imaginary numbers together
we're<00:06:58.439> multiplying<00:06:58.879> say<00:06:59.879> like<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.270> and<00:07:00.900> J<00:07:01.319> after

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
we're multiplying say like I and J after

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800 
we're multiplying say like I and J after
simplifying<00:07:02.789> of<00:07:02.969> course<00:07:03.210> we're<00:07:03.539> just<00:07:03.689> gonna

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
simplifying of course we're just gonna

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.300 
simplifying of course we're just gonna
here<00:07:04.169> use<00:07:04.409> binomial<00:07:05.400> expansion<00:07:06.500> or<00:07:07.500> just<00:07:08.069> foil

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
here use binomial expansion or just foil

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.149 
here use binomial expansion or just foil
method<00:07:08.490> and<00:07:09.029> here<00:07:09.930> we're<00:07:10.139> going<00:07:10.169> to<00:07:10.650> simplify

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
method and here we're going to simplify

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:12.589 
method and here we're going to simplify
and<00:07:11.550> then<00:07:11.580> multiply<00:07:12.000> the<00:07:12.060> two<00:07:12.270> monomials

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 
and then multiply the two monomials

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:15.350 
and then multiply the two monomials
together<00:07:13.050> when<00:07:13.979> we're<00:07:14.129> dividing<00:07:14.669> in<00:07:14.879> examples

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
together when we're dividing in examples

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.670 
together when we're dividing in examples
E<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.050> F<00:07:16.560> and<00:07:16.860> G<00:07:17.520> and<00:07:17.819> H<00:07:18.289> multiply<00:07:19.289> first<00:07:19.500> by

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
E and F and G and H multiply first by

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.529 
E and F and G and H multiply first by
the<00:07:19.740> conjugates<00:07:20.340> so<00:07:20.460> for<00:07:20.759> example<00:07:21.090> to<00:07:21.180> get<00:07:21.270> a

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
the conjugates so for example to get a

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.510 
the conjugates so for example to get a
the<00:07:21.750> first<00:07:21.930> thing<00:07:22.199> that<00:07:22.439> I<00:07:23.039> would<00:07:23.159> have<00:07:23.370> done

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 
the first thing that I would have done

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.170 
the first thing that I would have done
was<00:07:23.789> multiplied<00:07:24.180> by<00:07:24.330> 3<00:07:24.689> minus<00:07:25.139> 4<00:07:25.469> J<00:07:25.789> over<00:07:26.789> 3

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
was multiplied by 3 minus 4 J over 3

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.800 
was multiplied by 3 minus 4 J over 3
minus<00:07:27.750> 4<00:07:28.199> J<00:07:28.879> regular<00:07:29.879> multiplication<00:07:30.300> then

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
minus 4 J regular multiplication then

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.019 
minus 4 J regular multiplication then
simplify<00:07:31.529> the<00:07:31.590> top<00:07:31.830> simplify<00:07:32.400> the<00:07:32.460> bottom<00:07:32.849> and

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:33.029 
simplify the top simplify the bottom and

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:35.659 
simplify the top simplify the bottom and
this<00:07:33.629> would<00:07:33.810> be<00:07:33.900> the<00:07:33.990> result<00:07:34.289> that<00:07:34.409> we<00:07:34.529> get<00:07:34.669> so

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
this would be the result that we get so

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.990 
this would be the result that we get so
