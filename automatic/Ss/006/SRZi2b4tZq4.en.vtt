00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
stage now we're gonna win this group
stage<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.250> obviously<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.940> drew<00:00:57.329> against

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
stage because obviously we drew against

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
stage because obviously we drew against
Bayern<00:00:58.320> Munich<00:00:58.710> 22<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.780> last<00:01:01.079> episode<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
Bayern Munich 22 in the last episode and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
Bayern Munich 22 in the last episode and
they've<00:01:02.160> actually<00:01:02.280> drawn<00:01:02.670> against<00:01:02.969> another

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
they've actually drawn against another

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.260 
they've actually drawn against another
side<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.870> well<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.500> 11<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.519> drawn<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
side as well they have 11 and drawn to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.920 
side as well they have 11 and drawn to
which<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.130> ridiculous<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.479> guaranteed

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
which is ridiculous so we're guaranteed

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.270 
which is ridiculous so we're guaranteed
to<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.170> through<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> group<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to go through on the group and I just

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.380 
to go through on the group and I just
feel<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> waste<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.330> time

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
feel like this would be a waste of time

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.670 
feel like this would be a waste of time
actually<00:01:12.810> playing<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> match<00:01:13.530> because

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
actually playing this match because

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
actually playing this match because
we're<00:01:13.860> already<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.280> through<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
we're already going through on the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
we're already going through on the
group's<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> affect<00:01:16.049> it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
group's it's not going to affect it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
group's it's not going to affect it's
just<00:01:16.680> another<00:01:17.040> simulation<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.810> soon<00:01:19.110> see

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just another simulation and all soon see

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.550 
just another simulation and all soon see
how<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.770> fess<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.970> end<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:22.080> 1-nil<00:01:22.500> down

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
how I fess so we end up going 1-nil down

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
how I fess so we end up going 1-nil down
