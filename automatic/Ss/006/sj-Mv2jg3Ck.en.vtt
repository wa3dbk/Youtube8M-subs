oh<00:02:25.370> god<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.900> thing<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:29.450> good<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
oh god this thing is so it's good and

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.280 
oh god this thing is so it's good and
bad

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
bad

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.420 
bad
I<00:02:30.319> like<00:02:30.560> I've<00:02:30.680> already<00:02:30.890> said<00:02:30.980> it's<00:02:31.099> good<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
I like I've already said it's good so I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880 
I like I've already said it's good so I
can't<00:02:31.610> go<00:02:31.700> back<00:02:31.849> on<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:32.209> but<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.830> really

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
can't go back on it now but it's really

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.470 
can't go back on it now but it's really
balanced<00:02:34.459> because<00:02:34.700> if<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.030> any<00:02:35.239> better

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
balanced because if it was any better

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.030 
balanced because if it was any better
like<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.019> literally<00:02:36.290> had<00:02:36.440> any<00:02:36.680> kind<00:02:36.980> of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
like if it literally had any kind of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.190 
like if it literally had any kind of
faster<00:02:37.730> reload<00:02:38.299> or<00:02:38.510> more<00:02:38.599> bloats<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.959> clip

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
faster reload or more bloats in the clip

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.380 
faster reload or more bloats in the clip
it<00:02:39.680> would<00:02:39.799> be<00:02:39.920> overpowered<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.760> feel<00:02:41.299> like

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it would be overpowered but I feel like

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.990 
it would be overpowered but I feel like
it's<00:02:41.569> not<00:02:41.660> too<00:02:41.720> uppy<00:02:42.519> because<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> reload

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
it's not too uppy because of the reload

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.979 
it's not too uppy because of the reload
that's<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.330> only<00:02:44.480> drawback<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:45.019> feel<00:02:45.230> like

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
that's the only drawback I feel like

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.940 
that's the only drawback I feel like
alright<00:02:47.989> let's<00:02:48.049> go<00:02:48.230> ahead<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.500> call<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.799> our
