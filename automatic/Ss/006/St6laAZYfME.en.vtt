00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
so here we are gonna show you how to

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.420 
so here we are gonna show you how to
fillet<00:00:04.109> a<00:00:04.140> fish<00:00:04.260> in<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.890> case<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> little

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
fillet a fish in this case a little

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.750 
fillet a fish in this case a little
cooker<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:05.880> caught<00:00:06.090> so<00:00:07.050> uh<00:00:07.550> yeah<00:00:08.550> this

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
cooker we caught so uh yeah this

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.490 
cooker we caught so uh yeah this
shouldn't<00:00:09.120> be<00:00:09.269> too<00:00:09.690> much<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.080> challenge<00:00:10.470> to

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
shouldn't be too much of a challenge to

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.120 
shouldn't be too much of a challenge to
flank

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
flank

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.370 
flank
because<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.330> nice<00:00:12.510> and<00:00:12.750> smooth<00:00:13.019> right

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
because got it's nice and smooth right

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.620 
because got it's nice and smooth right
here<00:00:13.800> remember<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> drum<00:00:14.730> family<00:00:15.090> but<00:00:15.300> anyway

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
here remember the drum family but anyway

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.599 
here remember the drum family but anyway
so<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.680> kind<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.920> go<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.189> at<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> 45

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
so first you kind of go in at a 45

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.779 
so first you kind of go in at a 45
degree<00:00:17.909> angle<00:00:18.210> right<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:19.579> thank<00:00:20.579> you<00:00:20.640> so

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
degree angle right here thank you so

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.380 
degree angle right here thank you so
space<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.480> then<00:00:22.159> start<00:00:23.159> slicing<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.970> at<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
space and then start slicing in at this

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.069 
space and then start slicing in at this
45-degree<00:00:25.140> angle<00:00:25.499> so<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.159> kind<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.929> get<00:00:27.929> in

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
45-degree angle so you kind of get in

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.339 
45-degree angle so you kind of get in
right<00:00:29.069> to<00:00:29.669> the<00:00:29.819> bottom<00:00:29.999> and<00:00:30.659> then<00:00:30.989> some<00:00:31.229> people

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
right to the bottom and then some people

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
right to the bottom and then some people
just<00:00:31.499> go<00:00:31.949> all<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> way<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.720> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
just go all the way out like that but I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
just go all the way out like that but I
figured<00:00:34.199> it's<00:00:34.590> better<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.949> if<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.280> fish<00:00:35.550> have

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
figured it's better if if some fish have

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.180 
figured it's better if if some fish have
a<00:00:36.570> bone<00:00:36.809> structure<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.440> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> Ridge<00:00:38.010> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
a bone structure this kind of a Ridge I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.529 
a bone structure this kind of a Ridge I
don't<00:00:38.340> know<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.670> true<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.269> croaker

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
don't know if it's true for the croaker

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.900 
don't know if it's true for the croaker
or<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.590> usually<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.429> I<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.760> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
or not but usually what I do in this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.650 
or not but usually what I do in this
case<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.269> I<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.600> come<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.379> from<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> angle

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.119 

and<00:00:48.660> sometimes<00:00:49.260> you'll<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> problem<00:00:49.949> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and sometimes you'll have the problem of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.959 
and sometimes you'll have the problem of
skipping<00:00:51.120> through<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.920> spinal<00:00:52.920> cord<00:00:53.309> then

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
skipping through the spinal cord then

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.099 
skipping through the spinal cord then
you<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.269> of<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.449> stick<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> through<00:00:54.809> like

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
you kind of just stick it through like

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.590 
you kind of just stick it through like
that<00:00:55.640> does<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.940> you'll<00:00:57.089> get<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.359> problem

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
that does that you'll get the problem

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
that does that you'll get the problem
going<00:00:57.839> through<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> spinal<00:00:58.559> cord<00:00:58.769> if<00:00:58.859> you're

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
going through the spinal cord if you're

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.299 
going through the spinal cord if you're
not<00:00:59.070> careful<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.859> that<00:01:01.859> might<00:01:02.070> yeah

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
not careful but so just that might yeah

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.600 
not careful but so just that might yeah
that<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.640> happened<00:01:03.179> here<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:05.430> if

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that actually happened here but if

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
that actually happened here but if
that's<00:01:05.730> the<00:01:05.880> case<00:01:06.260> that's<00:01:07.260> pretty<00:01:07.470> common

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that's the case that's pretty common

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.400 
that's the case that's pretty common
just<00:01:08.250> stick<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.570> try<00:01:10.290> again

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
just stick it back through and try again

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.400 
just stick it back through and try again
might<00:01:11.010> lose<00:01:11.190> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.310> meat<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.940> yeah<00:01:12.630> what's

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
might lose a little meat but yeah what's

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.680 
might lose a little meat but yeah what's
fish<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.400> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.510> bone

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
fish that have like kind of a bone

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.510 
fish that have like kind of a bone
structure<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.830> might<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.190> little

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
structure like this it might be a little

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.070 
structure like this it might be a little
fragile<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> might<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.570> through<00:01:18.810> but

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
fragile and you might go through but

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.990 
fragile and you might go through but
it's<00:01:19.590> gotta<00:01:19.740> make<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.980> best<00:01:20.010> of<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> then

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's gotta make the best of it and then

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.300 
it's gotta make the best of it and then
just<00:01:21.210> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.510> yeah<00:01:22.290> bringing<00:01:22.920> challenging

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just kind of yeah bringing challenging

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.030 
just kind of yeah bringing challenging
those<00:01:23.430> they're<00:01:23.730> gonna<00:01:24.510> go<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.440> there<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
those they're gonna go in there just

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.350 
those they're gonna go in there just
kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> scrape<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> meat<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
kind of scrape the meat from the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
kind of scrape the meat from the
backbone<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.590> different<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.370> fish<00:01:29.700> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
backbone it's different for all fish I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
backbone it's different for all fish I
don't<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.480> exactly<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.410> do<00:01:31.530> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
don't know exactly how I can do this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
don't know exactly how I can do this
with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.190> croaker<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:33.300> go<00:01:33.510> in<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
with the croaker just go in there and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.570 
with the croaker just go in there and
just<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.320> scrape<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.830> backbone<00:01:36.200> and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
just kind of scrape the backbone and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.700 
just kind of scrape the backbone and
it's<00:01:38.580> free<00:01:38.910> it<00:01:39.000> foam<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:46.260> then<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> do

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's free it foam and then what you do

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
it's free it foam and then what you do
up<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.100> okay<00:01:47.940> make<00:01:48.600> sure<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:48.990> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
up to that okay make sure you got it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.830 
up to that okay make sure you got it
free<00:01:49.410> enough<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.980> then<00:01:50.370> just<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:51.480> it<00:01:51.660> like

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
free enough and then just take it like

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.180 
free enough and then just take it like
this<00:01:51.890> just<00:01:52.890> slice<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.670> from<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> backbone

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
this just slice it from the backbone

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.690 
this just slice it from the backbone
yeah<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.400> backbone<00:01:56.760> should<00:01:56.970> be<00:01:57.060> right<00:01:57.330> there

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
yeah the backbone should be right there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.480 
yeah the backbone should be right there
slice<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.880> along<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:01.710> come<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.070> corner

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
slice it along and then come off corner

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.160 
slice it along and then come off corner
of<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.640> anuses<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:04.800> then<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.010> got<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.190> flip

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
of the anuses and then you got a flip

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.999 
of the anuses and then you got a flip
fortunately<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> missed<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.590> little<00:02:07.680> bit<00:02:07.800> there

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
fortunately I missed a little bit there

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
fortunately I missed a little bit there
because<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.340> went<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> backbone<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
because it went to the backbone see it's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
because it went to the backbone see it's
got<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.380> fragile<00:02:10.890> bones<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.430> just

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
got really fragile bones and it just

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
got really fragile bones and it just
went<00:02:11.760> right<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.230> there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
went right through there

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
went right through there
but<00:02:14.160> these

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
but these

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.660 
but these
to<00:02:14.989> make<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.319> best<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.370> after

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
to make the best of it and then after

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.240 
to make the best of it and then after
that<00:02:16.909> this<00:02:17.780> part<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.319> lot<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.709> people<00:02:18.799> think

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
that this part a lot of people think

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.699 
that this part a lot of people think
it's<00:02:19.370> kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.819> hard<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.840> there's<00:02:21.439> a<00:02:21.530> little

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
it's kind of hard but there's a little

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's kind of hard but there's a little
fish<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.189> it's<00:02:22.790> really<00:02:22.939> not<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.150> hard

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
fish like this it's really not that hard

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.530 
fish like this it's really not that hard
just<00:02:23.569> go<00:02:24.019> along<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.379> bottom<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:26.299> bigger

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
just go along the bottom and with bigger

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.210 
just go along the bottom and with bigger
fish<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.049> actually<00:02:27.170> discovered<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
fish I actually discovered that of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.699 
fish I actually discovered that of
course<00:02:28.489> any<00:02:29.269> cook<00:02:29.659> who<00:02:29.840> cooks<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.260> fish<00:02:30.439> knows

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
course any cook who cooks the fish knows

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.380 
course any cook who cooks the fish knows
that<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.040> want<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> cut<00:02:31.519> out<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.909> red<00:02:32.120> streak
