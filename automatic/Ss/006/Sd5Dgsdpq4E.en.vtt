and nuts and seeds for growing children

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
and nuts and seeds for growing children
because<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.250> higher<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.699> fat<00:00:56.910> which

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because they are higher in fat which

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660

that's<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.200> those<00:05:57.680> are<00:05:57.919> my<00:05:58.010> thoughts<00:05:58.220> on

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
that's it those are my thoughts on

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.030 
that's it those are my thoughts on
feeding<00:05:59.120> a<00:05:59.210> child<00:05:59.240> a<00:05:59.630> 100%<00:06:00.290> raw<00:06:00.380> vegan<00:06:00.620> diet<00:06:00.650> I

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
feeding a child a 100% raw vegan diet I

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.190 
feeding a child a 100% raw vegan diet I
don't<00:06:01.580> think<00:06:01.820> it's<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:02.000> smart<00:06:02.090> thing<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.390> do<00:06:02.600> I

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
don't think it's a smart thing to do I

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.670 
don't think it's a smart thing to do I
think<00:06:03.470> it<00:06:03.860> is<00:06:04.040> in<00:06:04.340> experiment<00:06:05.300> 100%<00:06:06.290> for<00:06:06.650> sure

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
think it is in experiment 100% for sure

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.430 
think it is in experiment 100% for sure
we<00:06:07.250> don't<00:06:07.490> have<00:06:07.730> many<00:06:08.060> examples<00:06:08.300> of<00:06:08.900> people

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
we don't have many examples of people

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.680 
we don't have many examples of people
doing<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.919> and<00:06:10.190> a<00:06:10.220> lot<00:06:10.640> of<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:11.000> examples<00:06:11.419> that

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
doing it and a lot of the examples that

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.870 
doing it and a lot of the examples that

not good there are some pretty

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.080 
not good there are some pretty
terrifying<00:06:15.740> stories<00:06:16.190> of<00:06:16.430> people<00:06:16.790> feeding

stunted children and some of you may be

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.860 
stunted children and some of you may be
saying<00:06:22.430> well<00:06:22.730> yeah<00:06:22.970> but<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.360> don't<00:06:23.540> know<00:06:23.660> what

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
saying well yeah but you don't know what

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.970 
saying well yeah but you don't know what
they<00:06:23.960> were<00:06:24.050> feeding<00:06:24.230> their<00:06:24.440> kids<00:06:24.470> they<00:06:24.800> could

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
they were feeding their kids they could

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.320 
they were feeding their kids they could
have<00:06:25.070> just<00:06:25.280> been<00:06:25.370> feeding<00:06:25.550> them<00:06:25.760> oranges

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
have just been feeding them oranges

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.640 
have just been feeding them oranges
which<00:06:26.570> would<00:06:26.750> be<00:06:26.870> a<00:06:26.900> hundred<00:06:27.050> percent<00:06:27.230> we're

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
which would be a hundred percent we're

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.500 
which would be a hundred percent we're
all<00:06:27.710> but<00:06:27.919> obviously<00:06:28.430> not<00:06:28.640> very<00:06:28.669> healthy<00:06:29.210> and

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
all but obviously not very healthy and

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.840 
all but obviously not very healthy and
yeah<00:06:29.990> you're<00:06:30.260> right<00:06:30.500> maybe<00:06:31.100> they<00:06:31.400> were<00:06:31.460> doing

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
yeah you're right maybe they were doing

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.520 
yeah you're right maybe they were doing
it<00:06:31.970> the<00:06:32.210> wrong<00:06:32.390> way<00:06:32.450> so<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:33.050> speak

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
it the wrong way so to speak

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.010 
it the wrong way so to speak
they<00:06:33.710> weren't<00:06:33.919> supplementing<00:06:34.669> or<00:06:34.970> they<00:06:35.780> were

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
they weren't supplementing or they were

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.860 
they weren't supplementing or they were
giving<00:06:36.830> them<00:06:36.980> enough<00:06:37.280> fat<00:06:37.670> or<00:06:38.000> whatever<00:06:38.630> else

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
giving them enough fat or whatever else

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.960 
giving them enough fat or whatever else
you're<00:06:39.200> right<00:06:39.380> I<00:06:39.410> don't<00:06:39.770> really<00:06:40.010> know<00:06:40.220> but<00:06:40.820> my

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
you're right I don't really know but my

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.450 
you're right I don't really know but my
point<00:06:41.210> really<00:06:41.630> is<00:06:42.020> that<00:06:42.230> again<00:06:42.650> it's<00:06:43.190> still

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
point really is that again it's still

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.820 
point really is that again it's still
unnecessary<00:06:44.330> it's<00:06:44.660> unnecessary<00:06:45.470> to<00:06:45.560> go

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
unnecessary it's unnecessary to go

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.620 
unnecessary it's unnecessary to go
through<00:06:46.130> all<00:06:46.370> of<00:06:46.400> that<00:06:46.700> effort<00:06:46.850> to<00:06:47.060> feed<00:06:47.390> a<00:06:47.420> kid

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
through all of that effort to feed a kid

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.380 
through all of that effort to feed a kid
100%<00:06:48.320> raw<00:06:48.470> when<00:06:49.010> there's<00:06:49.160> no<00:06:49.460> evidence<00:06:49.940> there

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
100% raw when there's no evidence there

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.300 
100% raw when there's no evidence there
is<00:06:50.540> no<00:06:50.840> evidence<00:06:51.140> whatsoever<00:06:51.530> that<00:06:51.920> it<00:06:52.190> is

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
is no evidence whatsoever that it is

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.400 
is no evidence whatsoever that it is
better<00:06:52.550> than<00:06:53.030> feeding<00:06:53.390> your<00:06:53.510> kid<00:06:53.750> a<00:06:53.930> healthy

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
better than feeding your kid a healthy

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.560 
better than feeding your kid a healthy
plant-based<00:06:55.220> diet<00:06:55.580> but<00:06:56.060> that's<00:06:56.180> just<00:06:56.330> me

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
plant-based diet but that's just me

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.450 
plant-based diet but that's just me
that's<00:06:56.900> just<00:06:57.110> what<00:06:57.260> I<00:06:57.290> think<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:58.310> bird

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
that's just what I think the bird

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.490 
that's just what I think the bird

to<00:07:10.400> hit<00:07:10.570> 19,000<00:07:11.570> subs<00:07:11.810> I<00:07:11.960> think<00:07:12.200> so<00:07:12.590> I'm<00:07:12.740> pretty

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
to hit 19,000 subs I think so I'm pretty

close<00:07:13.310> to<00:07:13.550> 20,000<00:07:14.270> I<00:07:14.390> should<00:07:14.570> be<00:07:14.660> at<00:07:14.750> 20,000

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
close to 20,000 I should be at 20,000

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.070 
close to 20,000 I should be at 20,000
