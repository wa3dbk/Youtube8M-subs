 hi hello to kim jong i hope you are 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.899
 quite well and we are in the review of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.580
 a new script mode that the truth is 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.010
 pretty cool I did not think this was 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.670
 could since there is a cow that I 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.199
 traverses in the video and a truth that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.240
 it's pretty cool and what is it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 Does it work or what is that? 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 good as you saw in the title 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 obviously as always because he adds us 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.940
 what are more character and the truth that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 kraft they are pretty cool is 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.910
 more let's remove this so that it looks 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.129
 much better 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.590
 there is today in I think that is this can 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:38.610
 be the cover or something is daughter and good 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.649
 we touch the craft table and ok 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
 here you see everything normal and good 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.880
 before anything before first of all for 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.469
 that this mode can work is 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.500
 need to have the latest version 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.590
 of block launcher pro which is 1 points 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 6.7 but if they have any previous 1.6 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 point 6 or any other is not going to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 work is necessary to have the 1.6 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.210
 point 7 and you can download it from 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.640
 place of your preference so now yes 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 we go with the review as you can see then 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.280
 here everything is normal 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.750
 and also and this is where is what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.460
 incredible for example here we have what 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.549
 which are half restaurant cookies 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 heart and also down here we have 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 an apple of gold and also a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 golden carrot that is made with a 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 nugget that is in the part of here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.340
 down 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619
 ok those are new things that can be 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.789
 craft jarre and they are directly here in 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 the good inventory in the interface more 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.810
 good of the table and craft eoi is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.549
 pretty cool you should not do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 weird things as it was done with some 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 mods in the past and it's pretty 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.289
 amazing so it's a little bit of a motorbike 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 short and simple but pretty good like that 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.740
 that surely the metal the series of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.630
 mods so nothing I hope you have 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.970
