is<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> fatal<00:01:30.780> flaw<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.350> these

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
is a fatal flaw because these

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.350 
is a fatal flaw because these

when you're on the scooter BMW should

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
when you're on the scooter BMW should
have<00:01:35.970> made<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> bag<00:01:36.420> narrower<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> longer<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
have made the bag narrower and longer to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.249 
have made the bag narrower and longer to
fit<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> between<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.369> compartments<00:01:39.259> the

other problem is that the angle of the
attachment<00:01:42.360> strap<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:42.869> correct<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:44.009> pulls

to pull the bag down at the correct

elastic or better method to tighten them

elastic or better method to tighten them
because<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.820> difficult<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> strap

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
because it's difficult to get the strap

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.010 
because it's difficult to get the strap
tight<00:02:07.200> enough<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.590> hold<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.890> bag<00:02:08.750> one<00:02:09.750> more

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
tight enough to hold the bag one more

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.839 
tight enough to hold the bag one more
problem<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> location<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> adjuster

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
problem is the location of the adjuster

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.050 
problem is the location of the adjuster
for<00:02:12.060> locating<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.629> plastic

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
for locating the plastic

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.600 
for locating the plastic
clip<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:14.020> much<00:02:14.260> too<00:02:14.470> close<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> bag<00:02:15.250> so

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
clip it's much too close to the bag so

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.890 
clip it's much too close to the bag so
even<00:02:15.880> when<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.120> make<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.510> tight<00:02:16.690> as<00:02:16.840> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
even when you make it as tight as you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.050 
even when you make it as tight as you
can<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.709> run<00:02:17.920> out<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.069> adjustment<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.849> it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
can you run out of adjustment and it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.600 
can you run out of adjustment and it
just<00:02:19.239> doesn't<00:02:19.569> hold<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.840> bag<00:02:19.989> tight<00:02:20.290> enough

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
just doesn't hold the bag tight enough

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.949 
just doesn't hold the bag tight enough
they<00:02:21.610> should<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.940> put<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.150> down<00:02:22.390> farther<00:02:22.810> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
they should have put it down farther to

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.290 
they should have put it down farther to
get<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.290> travel<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.860> adjuster<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.550> can

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
get more travel on the adjuster you can

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.940 
get more travel on the adjuster you can
see<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.660> there's<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.080> not<00:02:26.230> enough<00:02:26.290> travel

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
see that there's just not enough travel

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.400 
see that there's just not enough travel
to<00:02:27.069> make<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.340> tighter<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.989> that's<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.260> quick

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
to make it tighter so that's a quick

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.430 
to make it tighter so that's a quick

look at the BMW c6 50 GT tunnel bag a

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.979
