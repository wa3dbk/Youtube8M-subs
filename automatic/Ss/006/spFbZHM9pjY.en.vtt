sense on some songs as well and there

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.830 
sense on some songs as well and there
are<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.610> weird<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.240> experimental

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
are some weird kind of experimental

are some weird kind of experimental
sounds<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.409> thing<00:01:07.590> too<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
sounds on this thing too like the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
sounds on this thing too like the
overuse<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> compression<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.409> some<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
overuse of compression on some of the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
overuse of compression on some of the
beats<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.510> ends<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.960> making

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
beats here which kind of ends up making

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
beats here which kind of ends up making
the<00:01:13.439> kick<00:01:13.979> drums<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.729> seem<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.150> black

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the kick drums kind of seem like a black

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.620 
the kick drums kind of seem like a black
hole<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> sonic<00:01:16.950> black<00:01:17.280> hole<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.119> sort<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
hole a sonic black hole that sort of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
hole a sonic black hole that sort of
when<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.960> hit<00:01:19.290> they<00:01:19.770> suck<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.250> every<00:01:20.610> sound

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
when they hit they suck up every sound

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
when they hit they suck up every sound
around<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.990> mm<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> sort<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
around them mm which is sort of a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.469 
around them mm which is sort of a
technique<00:01:23.549> I've<00:01:23.700> heard<00:01:23.880> applied<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.450> other

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
tell and it's sort of as if he wanted

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.040 
tell and it's sort of as if he wanted
his<00:05:47.010> fans<00:05:47.340> to<00:05:47.640> hear<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.000> kind<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.419> shift<00:05:48.780> in

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
his fans to hear this kind of shift in

his fans to hear this kind of shift in
his<00:05:49.680> production<00:05:50.460> style<00:05:50.760> because<00:05:51.120> these<00:05:51.300> songs

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
his production style because these songs

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.360 
his production style because these songs
are<00:05:51.780> noticeably<00:05:52.289> louder<00:05:52.560> than<00:05:52.919> many<00:05:53.130> other

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
are noticeably louder than many other

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.790 
are noticeably louder than many other
tracks<00:05:53.850> here<00:05:54.390> but<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.020> are<00:05:55.050> spots<00:05:55.350> on<00:05:55.590> here

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
tracks here but there are spots on here

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.000 
tracks here but there are spots on here
that<00:05:55.830> do<00:05:56.220> feel<00:05:56.490> familiar<00:05:56.789> for<00:05:57.660> no<00:05:58.410> such<00:05:58.650> thing

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
that do feel familiar for no such thing

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.000 
that do feel familiar for no such thing
but<00:05:59.370> I<00:06:00.060> just<00:06:00.840> kind<00:06:01.050> of<00:06:01.080> feel<00:06:01.289> like<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.530> sounds

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
but I just kind of feel like the sounds

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.170 
but I just kind of feel like the sounds
weren't<00:06:02.280> crafted<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.820> be<00:06:02.910> all<00:06:03.030> that

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
weren't crafted to be all that

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.730 
weren't crafted to be all that
interesting<00:06:03.660> which<00:06:03.810> is<00:06:03.840> surprised<00:06:04.320> because<00:06:04.590> a

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
interesting which is surprised because a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.230 
interesting which is surprised because a
lot<00:06:04.950> of<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.160> sounds<00:06:05.460> were<00:06:05.550> pretty<00:06:05.760> good<00:06:06.000> on

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
lot of the sounds were pretty good on

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.040 
lot of the sounds were pretty good on
drift<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:07.560> tracks<00:06:08.070> snap<00:06:08.580> which<00:06:09.330> has<00:06:09.630> a

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
drift the tracks snap which has a

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
drift the tracks snap which has a
hip-hop<00:06:10.560> influence<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.340> it<00:06:11.520> rhythmically<00:06:12.180> is

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
hip-hop influence to it rhythmically is

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.770 
hip-hop influence to it rhythmically is
actually<00:06:14.070> pretty<00:06:14.430> flat<00:06:14.850> and<00:06:15.060> bland<00:06:15.419> when<00:06:15.660> it

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
actually pretty flat and bland when it

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.719 
actually pretty flat and bland when it
comes<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.200> the<00:06:16.320> sounds<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.100> rhythm<00:06:17.460> the

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
comes to the sounds of the rhythm the

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.610 
comes to the sounds of the rhythm the
beat<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:18.030> just<00:06:18.210> really<00:06:18.479> kind<00:06:18.690> of<00:06:18.720> colorless<00:06:19.380> I

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
beat is just really kind of colorless I

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.010 
beat is just really kind of colorless I
guess<00:06:20.340> and<00:06:20.640> I<00:06:20.760> do<00:06:20.820> not<00:06:21.060> get<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.390> sloppily

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
guess and I do not get the sloppily

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.890 
guess and I do not get the sloppily
placed<00:06:22.470> high<00:06:22.860> hats<00:06:23.160> and<00:06:23.430> claps<00:06:23.760> on<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.720> song

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
placed high hats and claps on the song

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.990 
placed high hats and claps on the song
try<00:06:25.260> either<00:06:25.560> that<00:06:26.160> just<00:06:26.490> does<00:06:26.700> not<00:06:26.729> do

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
try either that just does not do

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.210 
try either that just does not do
anything<00:06:27.270> for<00:06:27.450> me<00:06:27.930> and<00:06:28.080> beyond<00:06:28.740> that<00:06:29.010> I'm<00:06:29.160> not

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
anything for me and beyond that I'm not

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.640 
anything for me and beyond that I'm not
really<00:06:29.460> sure<00:06:29.760> if<00:06:29.880> I'm<00:06:30.030> feeling<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.650> auto-tune

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
really sure if I'm feeling the auto-tune

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.909 
really sure if I'm feeling the auto-tune
