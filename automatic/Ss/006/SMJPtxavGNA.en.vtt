00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
are invincible to the police or the cops

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:39.240

whatever<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.350> guys<00:00:38.469> want<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.769> call<00:00:38.920> them<00:00:39.100> and

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
whatever you guys want to call them and

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.340 
whatever you guys want to call them and
they<00:00:39.309> can't<00:00:40.030> really<00:00:40.359> kill<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:40.929> they<00:00:41.199> can

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
they can't really kill you they can

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.810 
they can't really kill you they can
shoot<00:00:41.530> are<00:00:41.679> you<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.859> few<00:00:42.160> bullets<00:00:42.429> every<00:00:42.699> now

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
shoot are you a few bullets every now

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.520 
shoot are you a few bullets every now
and<00:00:42.969> then<00:00:43.059> but<00:00:43.239> not<00:00:43.690> enough<00:00:43.960> bullets<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.379> kill

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
and then but not enough bullets to kill

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.349 
and then but not enough bullets to kill
you<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.070> that's<00:00:45.519> a<00:00:45.640> really<00:00:45.910> cool<00:00:46.089> glitch

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
you and that's a really cool glitch

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:47.880 
you and that's a really cool glitch
because<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.839> can<00:00:46.989> actually<00:00:47.019> shoot<00:00:47.530> at<00:00:47.679> them

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
because you can actually shoot at them

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.380 
because you can actually shoot at them
so<00:00:48.219> every<00:00:48.550> time<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.730> have<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:48.940> wanted<00:00:49.359> level

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
so every time you have a wanted level

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.630 
so every time you have a wanted level
and<00:00:49.809> no<00:00:50.379> matter<00:00:50.530> how<00:00:50.739> many<00:00:50.920> stars<00:00:51.190> on<00:00:51.489> your

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
and no matter how many stars on your

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.250 
and no matter how many stars on your
wanted<00:00:51.999> level<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.269> can<00:00:52.420> go<00:00:52.510> ahead<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.780> come

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
wanted level you can go ahead and come

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.200 
wanted level you can go ahead and come
to<00:00:53.409> this<00:00:53.530> location<00:00:53.890> hop<00:00:54.280> inside<00:00:54.550> this<00:00:54.730> box<00:00:54.999> and

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
to this location hop inside this box and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.060 
to this location hop inside this box and
then<00:00:55.629> do<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:56.019> glitch<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.530> shoot<00:00:56.800> at<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
then do this glitch and shoot at the

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.770 
then do this glitch and shoot at the
police<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.640> as<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.269> can<00:00:58.359> see<00:00:58.420> they<00:00:58.659> don't

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
police and as you can see they don't

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.689 
police and as you can see they don't
really<00:00:59.079> do<00:00:59.260> anything<00:00:59.499> the<00:00:59.980> cops<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.280> get<00:01:00.550> up

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
really do anything the cops just get up

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.610 
really do anything the cops just get up
and<00:01:00.819> treat<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.239> as<00:01:01.449> they<00:01:01.600> just<00:01:01.780> died<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.230> it's

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
and treat you as they just died so it's

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.680 
and treat you as they just died so it's
a<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:03.010> fun<00:01:03.100> glitch<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.969> do<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.330> kind<00:01:04.570> of

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
a really fun glitch to do is kind of

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.899 
a really fun glitch to do is kind of
pointless<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.409> it<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.710> cool<00:01:06.009> to<00:01:06.250> show<00:01:06.640> off<00:01:06.790> to

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
