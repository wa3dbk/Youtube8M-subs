00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.620
 first of all started by drawing the 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.120
 body structure draw a line 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.120
 like this for the body and legs 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.080
 the length of the body and that of the legs 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.670
 is the same to do the upper body 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:36.110
 makes a rectangle around the line 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:37.370
 vertical then separated the rectangle into 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.769
 three years putting two lines 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.750
 horizontally the head including the 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.399
 bonnet make a third of the rectangle there 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.590
 must draw his face which is a 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.530
 oval shape makes both ears the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.850
 cap like this makes the legs them 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.070
 have no articulation at the level of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.610
 knees so they are slightly curved 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.610
 like this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.449
 for the arms they start at this level 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.710
 but as for the legs there is no 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.710
 articulation at the elbow 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.490
 the basic structure is finished does the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 backpack 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.360
 now you have to draw the details 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:31.120
 for the body makes arms like 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:49.990
 these son has only four fingers on 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:54.480
 every hand makes the shoes like 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.480
 this they have a very simple design 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.720
 make the pants 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.950
 for the face place and well both 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.880
 blackheads for the eyes and a very 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.160
 simple for the mouth 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.420
 the movie design does not have it 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.550
 given in most drawings 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:36.200
 erase unnecessary traits then done 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.200
 the finishes by blackening the lines
