00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 all right 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.590
 yes 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.550
 ok I just wanted to through a lot of 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.400
 things today in the dishwasher ever see 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.340
 the water that comes from here running down 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.460
 It can be seen as a calcium deposit 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.980
 that sees the water dripping from that side 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.010
 the general thing is a switch 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.340
 of the float has now been these 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.950
 float switches in this model in 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.950
 they have a little screw 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.010
 phillips again here that comes off 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.610
 it's usually just soap waste 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.800
 soap only accumulates inside as well 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.740
 you will see a lot worse than what 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.680
 it really is but it's really just 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.950
 the soap residue left behind like this 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.530
 that I'm going to show here I'm not sure 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.740
 this does not have a leak that was 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.140
 saying but if you can see all the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.079
 soap residue inside there 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 also this small rate float up 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.690
 that the water fills and is dedicated to this 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.620
 small switch that release that 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.890
 small 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.440
 territory this is how water tastes like this 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.740
 which is like the dishwasher that 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.050
 I have not been told to close the water 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.660
 Anyway, we have to clean 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.570
 all this here is as well as a 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.390
 solve this problem so I'm going to 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.150
 clean is all out since I am 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.810
 turn on the unit that way when 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.660
 someone dies they do not have a surprise 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.620
 in the first time you use 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.440
 dishwasher up here in the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.100
 dishwasher this is air space 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.650
 now well if some drain vomit of 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.740
 this air space is an indication 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.370
 of the layout drainage line 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.350
 of garbage is obstructed by the gap 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.480
 dishwasher air down here you can 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.450
 see this line that goes towards the 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.030
 garbage disposal this is our 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.600
 provision for the drainage line and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.210
 this is built with a gray food like this 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.510
 you have to undo the clamp 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.030
 here clear is the starting line 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.250
 hear the line one of the twelve for the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.060
 more stubborn can you connect a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.069
 hose faucet and just remove the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.500
 hell there is another way to do it 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.680
 also where you can take a brush and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.530
 run down to you center remove 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.510
 this cap here now well if your side 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.030
 dishes did not swallow it would be a good 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.430
 moment to check the inside of this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.829
 limit there is also often a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.040
 set is down so you can 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.440
 get my other hand on her from all 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 modes just face these two clips and 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.560
 that only has the right stage 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.829
 maintained I do not know if you've seen that but not 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.079
 it's like a chicken bone there sometimes 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.209
 if you are arranging the image or you are 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.329
 draining is the time to review is 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.489
 here in order to get the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.680
 chicken bone to float again what 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.829
 I will try to do is throw a little 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.109
 of water inside there and see if 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.200
 you can float to the top for me to 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.480
 times you float up when the line 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.690
 extension to sufficiently 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.970
 but I've seen it with plastic parts 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.060
 it's full now but you do not see it's not going 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.340
 float there for me but if it was like a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.620
 plastic toothpick or something 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.560
 like that you can sometimes get 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.690
 that float so I'm going to have to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.840
 do is run this through the 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.810
 drain cycle for a second and it goes 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.030
 to shoot water and everything but I have to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.959
 pull from there that I'll anyway 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.640
 back to that later on I just wanted to 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.000
 show you pÃ©rez a lot of things with 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.819
 dishwasher sometimes you are spring 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.920
 for this has broken often come out and 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.430
 You can separate the two halves of the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.280
 door and restore the spring that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.699
 it's a bit complicated but you only have 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.370
 to get a place to find 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.470
 reset is the latch sometimes it 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.560
 it needs a bit of an adjustment to 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.680
 get it we will see this work 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.990
 it's fine so it's not very strong like that 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.750
 that this looks like spring has 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.210
 come out because you should just 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.980
 they open automatically when you arrive 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.400
 to the point just if this is 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.620
 definitely broken so you need 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.250
 be reworked to restore the 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.770
 Spring themes can show sometimes 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.860
 the impeller is blocked 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.260
 dishwasher there are four screws that 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.140
 hold the lower fitting plate 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.210
 in and every type of impeller is a bit 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.820
 different this particular model 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.910
 has like a fan connected in the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.070
 same and that can only turn on 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.670
 fan blades to take off the 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.280
 impeller let me draw these four 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.770
 screws other types that will have to 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.400
 use as a screwdriver like two 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.020
 screwdrivers and nature 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.120
 push it against the motor impeller 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.850
 in order to stick on the impeller 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.000
 you just kind of keep spinning 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.270
 until it will be you will feel like 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.050
 really hard for a little bit and that of 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.790
 it will suddenly move very easy this is 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.040
 it's probably going to be a little 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.530
 unpleasant here we get our 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.230
 acoustic insulation here keep the 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.690
 noise outside the impeller if it had 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.500
 become dishwasher and you listen 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.500
 like a buzz 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.200
 inside a little 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.630
 bitterly and pleasantly and that is how it is 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.300
 can take off if that was left 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.640
 stuck other types now the shaft 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.130
 impeller here you will be able to 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.139
 convert anyway this is a bit 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.110
 of the rods 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:50.960
 there are some of the most common things 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.199
 to push it 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.199
 yes
