build chemistry and I think they can I
think<00:03:26.709> they<00:03:26.829> both<00:03:27.010> are<00:03:27.220> those<00:03:27.370> type<00:03:27.819> of

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
think it's I think they can build

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.099 
think it's I think they can build
chemistry<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.919> think<00:03:33.479> that<00:03:34.479> something<00:03:34.840> good<00:03:34.989> is

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
chemistry I think that something good is

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.159 
chemistry I think that something good is
going<00:03:35.199> to<00:03:35.260> happen<00:03:35.319> however<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.909> do<00:03:37.359> think<00:03:38.019> they

I'm just going to throw that out there
at<00:03:43.870> complexity's<00:03:44.319> not<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:44.919> give<00:03:45.040> them

going to leave the joint optic I think
though<00:03:48.759> that's<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.209> one<00:03:49.419> team<00:03:49.720> where<00:03:50.319> they

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
though that's the one team where they

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.499 
though that's the one team where they
don't<00:03:50.590> care<00:03:50.919> about<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.609> brands<00:03:52.060> they<00:03:52.120> want<00:03:52.419> to

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.219 
and YouTube and so I don't think anybody
from<00:03:59.769> complexity<00:04:00.250> would<00:04:00.340> leave<00:04:00.549> I<00:04:00.959> have<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
from complexity would leave I have to

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:05.159 
from complexity would leave I have to
say<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:03.009> I<00:04:03.040> think<00:04:03.220> if<00:04:03.790> anybody<00:04:04.509> uncurse

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
thought that somebody else on curse was

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.509 
thought that somebody else on curse was
gonna<00:04:07.599> leave<00:04:07.870> they<00:04:08.709> would<00:04:08.889> leave<00:04:09.129> it's<00:04:09.370> the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
gonna leave they would leave it's the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.610 
gonna leave they would leave it's the
same<00:04:09.849> thing<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.209> said<00:04:10.269> about<00:04:10.479> karma<00:04:11.139> leaving

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
same thing I said about karma leaving

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.439 
same thing I said about karma leaving
Envy<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.609> said<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.090> know<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.239> don't<00:04:13.419> think

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
Envy that I said you know I don't think

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.879 
Envy that I said you know I don't think
proof<00:04:13.720> he<00:04:13.840> will<00:04:13.930> leave<00:04:14.079> Envy<00:04:14.349> but<00:04:14.500> if<00:04:14.590> he<00:04:14.650> finds

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
proof he will leave Envy but if he finds

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.920 
proof he will leave Envy but if he finds
out<00:04:15.040> Karma's<00:04:15.459> leaving<00:04:15.819> he'll<00:04:16.269> leave<00:04:16.570> and

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
out Karma's leaving he'll leave and

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.810 
out Karma's leaving he'll leave and
he'll<00:04:17.049> take<00:04:17.259> that<00:04:17.500> offer<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:18.250> go<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.400> optic

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
he'll take that offer to go to optic

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.909 
he'll take that offer to go to optic
gaming<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.659> karma<00:04:20.229> left<00:04:20.470> without<00:04:20.620> telling

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
gaming but karma left without telling

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.200 
gaming but karma left without telling
anyone<00:04:21.250> he<00:04:21.459> just<00:04:21.609> announced<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.000> he<00:04:22.120> was

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
anyone he just announced that he was

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.719 
anyone he just announced that he was
leaving<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.779> so<00:04:23.050> that's<00:04:23.979> just<00:04:24.190> my<00:04:24.279> opinion<00:04:24.400> I

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
leaving and so that's just my opinion I

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.890 
leaving and so that's just my opinion I
think<00:04:24.760> they<00:04:25.029> should<00:04:25.210> go<00:04:25.300> after<00:04:25.419> someone<00:04:25.719> on

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
think they should go after someone on

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.120 
think they should go after someone on
curse

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
curse

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.490 
curse
if<00:04:27.730> that<00:04:28.030> happens<00:04:28.510> I'm<00:04:28.750> guessing<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.230> would<00:04:29.320> be

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
if that happens I'm guessing it would be

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.470 
if that happens I'm guessing it would be
like<00:04:29.710> parasite<00:04:30.280> parasite<00:04:30.910> even<00:04:31.120> tweeted

I do feel bad for TK in all of this you

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.540 
I do feel bad for TK in all of this you
know<00:04:55.720> but<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.080> thing<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.680> why<00:04:57.280> does

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
know but the thing is is that why does

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.340 
know but the thing is is that why does
TK<00:04:57.910> get<00:04:58.150> second<00:04:58.480> place<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:58.780> much<00:04:58.960> they<00:04:59.230> have

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
TK get second place so much they have

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.590 
TK get second place so much they have
chemistry<00:04:59.680> nez<00:05:00.100> low<00:05:00.340> sharpen<00:05:01.150> theory<00:05:01.450> have

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
chemistry nez low sharpen theory have

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.540 
chemistry nez low sharpen theory have
chemistry<00:05:02.230> they<00:05:02.740> can<00:05:02.920> pick<00:05:03.130> up<00:05:03.280> another

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
chemistry they can pick up another

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.370 
chemistry they can pick up another
fourth<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.120> they'll<00:05:04.270> be<00:05:04.390> fine

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
fourth and they'll be fine

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.890 
fourth and they'll be fine
and<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:07.060> know<00:05:07.180> there's<00:05:07.360> some<00:05:07.480> guys<00:05:07.660> that

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
and so I you know there's some guys that

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.330 
and so I you know there's some guys that
are<00:05:07.930> kind<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.230> left<00:05:08.440> out<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:08.770> all<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.980> this<00:05:09.130> but

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
are kind of left out in all of this but

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.160 
are kind of left out in all of this but
the<00:05:09.670> reason<00:05:10.060> why<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.210> roster<00:05:10.660> mania<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:10.960> just

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
the reason why I roster mania is just

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.320 
the reason why I roster mania is just
starting<00:05:11.470> is<00:05:11.590> because<00:05:11.950> all<00:05:12.430> of<00:05:12.490> these<00:05:12.940> changes

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
starting is because all of these changes

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.450 
starting is because all of these changes
are<00:05:13.720> going<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.870> create<00:05:14.170> more<00:05:14.560> changes<00:05:15.100> optic

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
are going to create more changes optic

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.130 
are going to create more changes optic
gaming<00:05:15.610> is<00:05:15.940> probably<00:05:16.270> not<00:05:16.570> going<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.840> pick<00:05:17.020> up

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
gaming is probably not going to pick up

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
think that clay ster was offered optic

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.840 
think that clay ster was offered optic
when<00:06:01.900> he<00:06:01.990> went<00:06:02.140> to<00:06:02.200> TK<00:06:02.560> no<00:06:02.830> he<00:06:03.070> was<00:06:03.220> not<00:06:03.400> that's

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
when he went to TK no he was not that's

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.680 
when he went to TK no he was not that's

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
but I don't think so because like he

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.520
