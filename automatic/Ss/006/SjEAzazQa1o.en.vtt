00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.850
 welcome back to gamescom 2012 4 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.180
 with at the start with the jay standing here 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:16.289
 the far cry 3 stood and the park at 321 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.939
 gastspiel one must not tell my 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289
 favorite player but i said that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.859
 graphic alone as a baby was already 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.039
 cool horny I also like to ride but 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.269
 not even two now 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.310
 second part was then relatively 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.030
 you have to say disappointment 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.239
 or 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.620
 Yes 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.969
 damn disappointing 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.920
 I have no homeland our cameraman 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.210
 we always try to understand 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 distracted and then somehow between 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.790
 so in any case talk as wlan the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 traders have seen to part 3 but still 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.760
 all a bit mended honestly 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.920
 So never said so bad 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.199
 fail because the whole far cry series 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.790
 because nothing has to do with the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.530
 are details is again a completely 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.120
 he told new stories 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.989
 for example, whether with this unspeakable 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 film by til silence to do and she 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.590
 You never really have to see it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.210
 but see below is trailer of far cry 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 3 seeds from good is just coming back 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 ego shooter ego shooter with castles what 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.499
 currently totally in 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.049
 but still interesting with 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.729
 an interesting antagonist and such 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.890
 what else do you have to clear? 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.020
 rarely in the game or if you have it in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.149
 Playing has an interesting type 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.469
 against the whole game over quasi 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.750
 fight and every now and then 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.310
 then that's what I think makes something like that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.719
 a game really cool in part 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.849
 and the antagonist would be the potential 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.619
 I say and we look in any case 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.969
 have a look and would have to know how 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.159
 it feels like playing before you 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.780
 here too many praises and makes 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.950
 that's why we speak and immediately 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:58.369
 look forward did stooges spoken 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.369
 with equal to three definition of insane 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.310
 a full portfolio of joseph coutts 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.690
 done far cry 3 is played and 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.180
 it has confirmed what we suspected 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.890
 it was not bad it was now 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.270
 also not all the game led all 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.860
 times because it happens to be an ego 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.900
 shooter and you could only do it with one 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.390
 xbox 360 controller play what 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.310
 Of course , that's always a bit 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 difficult with us old pc i have 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.150
 fear does not matter 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.410
 We should not be here now 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.420
 have been interested in this for a long time now 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.069
 our cameraman needs one has 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.350
 So here's how three months play 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.209
 ever at the e3 press conference 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.880
 It has to be said that it's beautiful first 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.350
 Los there you have the biggest in the picture 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.690
 So one has ridden by 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.130
 a keen native gentleman 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.130
 is somehow the new leader or something 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.170
 there were cables 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.969
 That's how it starts and then you face it 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.200
 so much through water and jogl 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.930
 and then a little bit through the 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.700
 adversary attacked with one of tigers 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.219
 So the scene is relatively well known 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.280
 and I do not even have it that way 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:58.420
 good to play there as it did at 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.420
 the demo was played 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.690
 to be distracted to you 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.570
 May make 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.160
 and further I have to say 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.340
 Interestingly, what a little bit 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.500
 Talking against the game is the demo 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.390
 has been developed here was 23 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.620
 a thousand times and had it anyway 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.250
 I in the bow the tiger me the mini 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.650
 attacked 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.100
 i just stood next to yes contest each 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.670
 fall a final really cool 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.670
 there capo 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.190
 otherwise it played well 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.590
 Apart from that one has controller 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.449
 the antagonist is just like 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.400
 said already quite interesting times 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.199
 in between so dream sequences because he 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.350
 somehow puts on drugs or something 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.080
 the success has a psychic right 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 and I think that so luck that could 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.560
 a little more what do you mean I am with it 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.120
 It's also said enough we 're at 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.120
 next game again three people
