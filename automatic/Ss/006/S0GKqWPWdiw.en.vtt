00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so today I visited enough 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.649
 very simple idea why not 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 do catching crabs and don't show you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.950
 how it is done and so today we are with you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 go catching crabs so here 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.990
 we have a shop where it is all 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.350
 pleasure is sold and now we are with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 What are you looking at and see what's there 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.760
 can buy to catch 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.540
 crab 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.360
 so we go to the store of all kinds 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.870
 accessories here you can buy something 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 anything here for sale like everything 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 here you can buy here for example 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.870
 live shrimp that's how much the outcome 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 5 dollars and grades here are fat 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 shrimp head 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 and here are just monsters present besides 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.019
 shrimp crabs are still sold here but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.659
 small for bait so here they are 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.090
 look here and so they enjoy 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.830
 perhaps 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.340
 but we will catch crabs which 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.790
 much 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.790
 more 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:25.960
 with the firm and so here she is my trap 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.579
 Now it will be removed from it will prepare 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.670
 price tag and in a couple of minutes it will 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:40.000
 ready to throw it to the bottom 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:43.329
 the gulf is paying off at the counter it 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.789
 pleasure will all cost us 37 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.789
 dollars well what do crabs worth 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.409
 the next stage must be plunged into a trap 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:03.530
 inflatable boat and take her inside yourself 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.850
 what are we doing now and so here we are 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.180
 already at home means for bait we 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.880
 use the most ordinary chicken 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.190
 the insides are chicken legs he is the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.780
 supermarket for sale for a penny 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.770
 Now we will open this pack and throw out 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.980
 all this good 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.930
 here in this well for bait 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 here it all goes here it all 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.110
 fall maybe even quit it yet 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.720
 scary let it stinks mean here then 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:45.280
 this cap closes the ruble closed 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.920
 such a cord is tied to a trap 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.040
 here 's a crabs through this window 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.350
 crawl and get out they can not 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.510
 to get out 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.120
 they need to open the door but from the door 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.130
 the exit is natural only in one place to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.730
 me on the caboose and so is our first trap 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.730
 goes to catch crabs 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:21.069
 I specifically throw a very large 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:26.560
 amount of cord in order from 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.909
 wind yacht moves and in order to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.489
 the trap remained in place outside 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.780
 depending on where to move 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.900
 the yacht is like this 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.549
 say refuel and now us 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.019
 It remains to wait well 12 hours a day and 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.819
 in a day 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:51.040
 code camcorder we'll get this 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.989
 trap and see how much we have 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.720
 It turned out crabs and maybe not at all 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.959
 will know him then maybe they are here at all 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.549
 No, well today, let's see what 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.939
 caught us there want to please you 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.409
 house see what happens to be there 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:10.000
 really so take out the trap from the water 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.389
 now try not hard with one hand and 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.970
 pull out and show but try so 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:22.570
 and the camera is armpit that we have there 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:25.870
 caught well of course the catch is not rich but 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.419
 a couple of crabs you can eat from the trap 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.349
 continue to let it still run there 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.919
 still by catches like this 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:38.979
 add to mine crabs here apparently 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.539
 the place is not very successful and therefore I 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.580
 most likely just get over 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.099
 somewhere close to the shore and set 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.099
 her there about the results will report
