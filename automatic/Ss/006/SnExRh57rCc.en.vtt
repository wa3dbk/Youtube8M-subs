00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
to do is I'm going to start around this

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.859 
to do is I'm going to start around this
corner<00:01:31.750> here<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:34.360> it's<00:01:34.479> not<00:01:34.600> really<00:01:34.750> a

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
corner here well it's not really a

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.230 
corner here well it's not really a
corner<00:01:35.350> but<00:01:35.679> I<00:01:36.420> am<00:01:37.420> definitely<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.939> kind<00:01:40.179> of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
corner but I am definitely just kind of

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.419 
corner but I am definitely just kind of
swirling<00:01:40.659> it<00:01:40.899> around<00:01:43.170> okay<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:45.009> I<00:01:45.130> don't<00:01:45.159> like

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
swirling it around okay but I don't like

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.630 
swirling it around okay but I don't like
that<00:01:45.610> yet<00:01:45.849> so<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:47.829> going<00:01:48.099> to<00:01:48.130> start<00:01:48.369> back<00:01:48.610> over

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
that yet so I'm going to start back over

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.940 
that yet so I'm going to start back over
here<00:01:49.239> and<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:50.799> going<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.009> continue<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:53.409> swirl

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
here and I'm going to continue to swirl

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:04.350 
here and I'm going to continue to swirl
around

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.770 

until<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.110> have<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.760> if<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:07.000> had<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.150> larger<00:02:07.570> nail

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
until I have that if I had a larger nail

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.570 
until I have that if I had a larger nail
this<00:02:08.170> would<00:02:08.380> work<00:02:08.590> well<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:09.429> actually

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
this would work well but it's actually

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.120 
this would work well but it's actually
not<00:02:09.940> going<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.360> work<00:02:10.539> well<00:02:10.780> for<00:02:11.020> me<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.890> need

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.110 
just doing my index finger I get a
little<00:02:20.140> bit<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.380> glob<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.800> paint<00:02:21.460> right<00:02:21.730> here

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
little bit of glob of paint right here

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.000 
little bit of glob of paint right here
I'm<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.750> do<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> same<00:02:23.680> thing<00:02:23.920> I

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I'm just going to do the same thing I

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.780 
I'm just going to do the same thing I
did<00:02:24.070> for<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> bubble<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:26.110> check<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.790> ok

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
did for the bubble just check that up ok

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.510 
did for the bubble just check that up ok
so<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:28.750> my<00:02:29.110> nail<00:02:29.320> prepped<00:02:29.710> with<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.280> coat

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
so I have my nail prepped with one coat

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.449 
so I have my nail prepped with one coat
of<00:02:30.580> OPI<00:02:31.150> red<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.770> going<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> do<00:02:33.220> is

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
of OPI red and all I'm going to do is

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.510 
of OPI red and all I'm going to do is
slowly<00:02:33.790> dip<00:02:34.150> my<00:02:34.300> finger<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:39.100> kind<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.370> give

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
slowly dip my finger in and kind of give

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.150 
slowly dip my finger in and kind of give
it<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> second<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.440> while<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.770> there<00:02:41.980> are

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.400 
kind of blow on the nail polish a little
bit<00:02:43.989> because<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.220> helps<00:02:45.489> it<00:02:45.610> dry<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:47.080> makes<00:02:47.290> it
