00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
when installing into the frame so each

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
when installing into the frame so each
process<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> driver's<00:01:33.240> side<00:01:33.270> will

repeat exactly on the passenger side as

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.249 
repeat exactly on the passenger side as
you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> requirement

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can see here it's not a requirement

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
you can see here it's not a requirement
to<00:01:37.530> lower<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> exhaust<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.490> once<00:01:38.640> our

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to lower the exhaust but once our

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
to lower the exhaust but once our
hardware<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> position<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> passenger

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
hardware is in position on the passenger

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.980 
hardware is in position on the passenger
side<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.460> becomes<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.060> much<00:01:42.240> tighter<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> bit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
side it becomes a much tighter and bit

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
side it becomes a much tighter and bit
more<00:01:43.140> difficult<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.740> our<00:01:43.860> hitch<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> place

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
more difficult to get our hitch in place

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
more difficult to get our hitch in place
so<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.240> gonna<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:45.960> some<00:01:45.990> spray

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so what I'm gonna do is take some spray

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
so what I'm gonna do is take some spray
lubricant<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> rubber
