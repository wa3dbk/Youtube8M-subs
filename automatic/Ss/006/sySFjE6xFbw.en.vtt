level in about four hours of playing

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.210 
level in about four hours of playing
which<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.909> mean<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.570> you're<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> level

which is I mean if you're like a level
1000<00:01:23.880> plus<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.299> pretty<00:01:24.540> shitty<00:01:25.290> but

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
1000 plus that's pretty shitty but

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
1000 plus that's pretty shitty but
considering<00:01:26.729> i'm<00:01:26.820> starting<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.210> level<00:01:27.330> 1

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
considering i'm starting at level 1

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.710 
considering i'm starting at level 1
everything<00:01:28.340> aside<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.670> constitution<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
everything aside from constitution I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
everything aside from constitution I
think<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.140> pretty<00:01:31.259> good<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> got

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
think that's pretty good and I just got

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.740 
think that's pretty good and I just got
35<00:01:34.049> making<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.549> quests<00:01:36.210> I've<00:01:36.420> done

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.620 

so<00:01:39.750> far<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:40.610> plugged<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> can

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so far are plugged back that you can

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.910 
so far are plugged back that you can
just<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.869> their<00:01:43.049> Vampire<00:01:43.500> Slayer<00:01:43.770> was

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
just see their Vampire Slayer was

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.670 
just see their Vampire Slayer was
probably<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.509> fat<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> fastest<00:01:46.470> but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
probably the fat one of the fastest but

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
probably the fat one of the fastest but
it<00:01:47.280> wasn't<00:01:47.610> hard<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.270> looked<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> was

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it wasn't hard but it looked like it was

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170 
it wasn't hard but it looked like it was
going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.520> had<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> kill<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going to be hard because I had to kill a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.080 
going to be hard because I had to kill a
level<00:01:51.540> 40<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:52.680> 60<00:01:53.130> something<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
level 40 or 60 something like that and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.679 
level 40 or 60 something like that and
in<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> video<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.950> had<00:01:56.100> six<00:01:57.000> magic<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in the video i only had six magic and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.569 
in the video i only had six magic and
two<00:01:57.840> defense<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.680> still<00:01:59.009> want<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> be

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
two defense so I still want it to be

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.440 
two defense so I still want it to be
evenly<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> say<00:02:02.070> how<00:02:02.310> long

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
evenly I'm not going to say how long

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
evenly I'm not going to say how long
it'll<00:02:03.450> come<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.689> later<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> video<00:02:04.409> but

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it'll come up later in the video but

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.190 
it'll come up later in the video but
that's<00:02:05.549> pretty<00:02:05.700> much<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.969> commentary<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that's pretty much the commentary the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
that's pretty much the commentary the
rest<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.280> music<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
rest will just have some music in the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
rest will just have some music in the
background<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.840> show<00:02:10.080> clips<00:02:10.440> of

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
background and just show clips of

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.620 
background and just show clips of
everything<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.340> did<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.879> far

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
everything I did so far
