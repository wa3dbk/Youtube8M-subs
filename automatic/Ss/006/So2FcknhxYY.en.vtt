00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.959
 let's start with the oil and take 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.919
 our chile 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.000
 then it came from the ingredients 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:34.420
 sleepy animals as if they are 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:38.089
 I bring a dream but I said good 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:44.800
 today I'm going to make chick 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.800
 crumbled with tomato and chili onion 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.900
 it's a little 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.880
 we're 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 dying 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.710
 thus thundering what will the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.710
 vegetable 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.030
 but how are you going to do that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 but logic that will be those of horitas 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:35.640
 delicious let's remove the comal to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 when the package is ready 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.480
 same time ready I have ready the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.620
 beans today I'm not going to 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.200
 make mashed will do the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.060
 interviews and here we still have the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.990
 chicken water in case suddenly 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.560
 We expose a teaspoon of caldito 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 juices 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.450
 and consumers I do not know maybe some 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.380
 drams of your son / a body that already 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.410
 is ready what would be in the chilito the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.250
 onion like stay ok is nothing more 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:18.680
 one chile and half onion and two tomatoes 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.680
 where he did not seem off camera 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.240
 if the fish 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.410
 because students about the little bit is 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.910
 nothing more so that the tomato in bulk 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.910
 to request this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.750
 I'm going to cover it 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.439
 and that is that I walk block 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.150
 30 where else to stir little 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.140
 again 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.150
 once I'm going to put the tortillas to 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 heat this this is very fast 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.349
 ok and what I'm going to do is add the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.349
 folio 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.180
 when crumbling the chicken to stir a 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.000
 little machine I'm going to put everything 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.000
 little pepper pepper to taste 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.750
 when this one can already be said so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
 that since nothing more is resolved with 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.840
 that they cover it with that they have as 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.480
 I say a little bit, leaving nothing else 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.520
 that would be like a teaspoon is all 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.520
 what the machine and what they will return to 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 cover for less than a minute 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.760
 and good that we are going to turn the 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.200
 tortillas 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.200
 It is the fastest place 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.930
 I already turned it off they saw louis say in two 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.189
 portals the same time already going to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.189
 heat alcalÃ¡ sorkin 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.340
 and for 40 days 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.660
 I will show the links 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.900
 ah 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.790
 if they saw these the benches more 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.100
 fast I made this soup 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.400
 very simple that they do not want to confuse 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:58.110
 we 're all going to win with a teaspoon 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.470
 deeper and you can put the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.470
 juicy 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.340
 we will accompany 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.120
 the tortilla 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.010
 the tortillas and good 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.080
 ay ay ay 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.940
 because this one quoted us friends 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.100
 Y 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.100
 one 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:57.449
 in chick tomato chili or chick 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:03.509
 crumble Mexican side let's say 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:07.439
 so no name but I put it is 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:11.369
 another way to do when 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:18.679
 feel like cooking a lot and well 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:20.759
 We'll see you in the next one I do not like 

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:24.930
 I like that they stay a little bit more 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:28.229
 crown like almost toast 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.889
 there are already others in the strong table here 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.889
 I have you 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.880
 because they would be going to trap me 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.130
 teach that on camera but if I'm going to 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.230
 teach a custom I do not know where the 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.790
 I grabbed I like to put a little older 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.410
 towards the tortilla is a mass of account 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.080
 on one side or if you want to put them all 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.180
 They put everyone else, either 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.120
 that he does in the taquito nothing else I saw 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.470
 in the double bend it and that gives a 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.470
 taste to the food but anger 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.539
 and he explained still 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.539
 i 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.030
 I recommend them is not good for 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.030
 diet but in flavors
