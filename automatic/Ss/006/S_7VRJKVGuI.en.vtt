00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
well and one of the main reasons why

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.850 
well and one of the main reasons why
I've<00:01:43.880> got<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.210> as<00:01:44.390> well<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:45.440> dual<00:01:45.650> band

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
I've got this as well so dual band

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.530 
I've got this as well so dual band
basically<00:01:46.190> means<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.490> works<00:01:46.670> on<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> 2.4

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
basically means it works on the 2.4

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.200 
basically means it works on the 2.4
gigahertz<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:48.170> five<00:01:48.380> gigahertz<00:01:49.060> spectrum<00:01:50.060> so

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
gigahertz in five gigahertz spectrum so

that but they can also work on the 5
gigahertz<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:03.170> what<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.410> going<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
gigahertz and what this is going to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.440 
gigahertz and what this is going to
allow<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.040> do<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.220> this<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.700> free<00:02:05.060> up<00:02:05.240> that

allow you to do is this to free up that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.100 
allow you to do is this to free up that
space<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.410> only<00:02:06.710> 2.4<00:02:07.280> gigahertz<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.970> just<00:02:08.959> to

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
space is only 2.4 gigahertz and just to

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
space is only 2.4 gigahertz and just to
free<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.679> up<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.100> everything<00:02:10.399> won't<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:10.670> as

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789
