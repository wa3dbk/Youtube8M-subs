00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.549
 if you are one of those who have a PC ready 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.550
 to play with a good graphic system and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.260
 a processor at breakneck speeds 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.350
 sure you know any of these 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 games could be referred to as games 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.330
 of the most demanding market and that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 will test your pc on many of them 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.099
 if you play at a high resolution and with 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.150
 some image filter practically 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.620
 any pc ends up suffering today you'll see 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.180
 the five heaviest pc games 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.180
 number 5 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.140
 despite being a 2011 battlefield game 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.720
 3 is still testing the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.910
 components of your pc the difference between 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.100
 battlefield and call of duty is that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.580
 Multiplayer games include nothing 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.940
 less than 64 real players besides 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.580
 aircraft vehicles etc. obviously in 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.490
 this position is included battlefield 4 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.950
 if you have a shit disguised as pc 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.520
 I think you could settle for this one 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.520
 battlefield 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.410
 the battery is always discharged and the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.100
 reception is not very lawful my money 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.100
 Number 4 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 Have you ever seen the exorbitant weight 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:40.570
 of grand theft auto 4 no, I'm telling you 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.320
 27.94 gigabytes not being satisfied with 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:48.090
 this looks in youtube criticizes the error and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 well the rest is history 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.970
 but fuck someone who cleans all that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.200
 trail 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.200
 number 3 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.300
 If you are a true gamer, you will know that 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.730
 game is in this position 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.030
 They do not know yet so let me 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.610
 present crisis just look at the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.910
 example and the worst of all is that the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.280
 game is not at its full resolution to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.490
 today some fish gamers run 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.950
 this game full with a little bit of like for 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.400
 serve this game to the fullest without 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.290
 that some the best is to buy a pc 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.519
 alien 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.519
 number 2 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.400
 a game does not have to have some 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.400
 extremely excellent graphics for 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.720
 called a heavy game this is the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.420
 case of total war shogun 2 this is a 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.450
 turn-based game that combines strategies 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.420
 of war in real time as a company of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 heroes or starcraft the game is very 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.530
 heavy because they keep track of 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.470
 each unit this requires a large 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.840
 Process capability not any pc 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.360
 I could run this game even with the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.360
 minimum resolution and low graphics 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 number 1 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.460
 hello kitty hidden stars is a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.710
 Extremely heavy game for its 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.210
 incredible graphics besides nai is 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.210
 bad guys 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.190

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.190

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 they will see 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.670
 I was thinking for a long time that I play 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.840
 was the heaviest of all and I got to the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.120
 conclusion of all absolutely all 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.849
 the games of the new generation and 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.330
 some old ones are heavy that a pc 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.430
 ordinary can not download 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.800
 remember that this is at my discretion and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.569

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.489
