00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
people read about it but instead I got

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.440 
people read about it but instead I got
the<00:04:27.620> curls<00:04:27.890> if<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.160> enter<00:04:28.310> cream<00:04:28.720> now<00:04:29.720> my<00:04:29.960> hair's

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
my hair I considered to be 4b 4c and so

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.170 
my hair I considered to be 4b 4c and so
not<00:04:36.110> too<00:04:36.350> sure<00:04:36.560> what<00:04:37.100> curls<00:04:37.430> out<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.850> be<00:04:37.970> fine

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
not too sure what curls out to be fine

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.090 
not too sure what curls out to be fine
but<00:04:38.480> I<00:04:38.540> decided<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:39.080> wanted<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.410> buy<00:04:39.590> his<00:04:39.800> human

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100

was<00:04:49.670> curious<00:04:50.000> about<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.330> point<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.290> is

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
was curious about that point and that is

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.500 
was curious about that point and that is
why<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.860> bought<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.850> what<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.000> did<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.450> used

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
why I bought this so what I did I used

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.670 
why I bought this so what I did I used
one<00:04:53.900> down<00:04:54.110> here<00:04:54.530> and<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:56.600> smooth<00:04:56.990> it<00:04:57.020> on<00:04:57.290> and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
one down here and I smooth it on and

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.410 
one down here and I smooth it on and
then<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:57.920> did<00:04:58.100> twist<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.520> little<00:04:58.550> twist<00:04:59.000> out<00:04:59.150> with

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
then I did twist a little twist out with

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.260 
then I did twist a little twist out with
this<00:04:59.630> I<00:05:00.280> was<00:05:01.280> not<00:05:01.520> very<00:05:01.670> impressed<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:02.120> this

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
this I was not very impressed with this

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.850 
this I was not very impressed with this
I<00:05:03.040> believe<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.460> would<00:05:04.580> work<00:05:04.610> for<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:06.440> tree

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
I believe it would work for the tree

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.940 
I believe it would work for the tree
curl<00:05:07.400> type<00:05:07.700> maybe<00:05:08.390> even<00:05:08.720> before<00:05:08.840> 8<00:05:09.260> but<00:05:09.620> for

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
curl type maybe even before 8 but for

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.310 
curl type maybe even before 8 but for
four<00:05:10.190> before<00:05:10.400> see<00:05:10.910> was<00:05:11.510> not<00:05:11.720> very<00:05:12.020> impressed

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
four before see was not very impressed

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.160 
four before see was not very impressed
with<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:13.090> use<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.270> only<00:05:14.570> once<00:05:14.750> or<00:05:14.930> twice

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
with this use the only once or twice

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.980 
with this use the only once or twice
after<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.890> because<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.730> my<00:05:17.480> hair<00:05:17.720> felt

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
after that because of it it my hair felt

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.400 
after that because of it it my hair felt
a<00:05:18.140> bit<00:05:18.350> dry<00:05:18.680> after<00:05:19.160> using<00:05:19.490> this<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.840> maybe<00:05:21.080> if<00:05:21.320> I

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
a bit dry after using this so maybe if I

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.200 
a bit dry after using this so maybe if I
had<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.770> even<00:05:22.100> conditioner<00:05:22.669> associated<00:05:23.120> with

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
had the even conditioner associated with

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.670 
had the even conditioner associated with
this<00:05:23.390> maybe<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:24.020> would<00:05:24.169> have<00:05:24.230> worked<00:05:24.410> better

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
this maybe it would have worked better

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.700 
this maybe it would have worked better
if<00:05:25.220> I<00:05:25.760> find<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.360> here<00:05:26.540> in<00:05:26.570> Trinidad<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.350> will

if I find it here in Trinidad I will

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.480 
if I find it here in Trinidad I will
purchase<00:05:27.950> it

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
purchase it

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.030
