00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:49.639 
little ramp right there I thought they

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.760 
little ramp right there I thought they
would<00:01:49.669> like<00:01:50.060> climbing<00:01:50.569> on<00:01:50.689> them<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.020> sleep<00:01:51.619> it

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770

colors<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.640> like<00:03:04.820> 999<00:03:05.270> at<00:03:05.750> petsmart<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.470> think

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
colors is like 999 at petsmart I think

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.199 
colors is like 999 at petsmart I think
they<00:03:06.980> start<00:03:07.160> around<00:03:07.280> six<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.850> half<00:03:07.880> dollar

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
they start around six and a half dollar

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.060 
they start around six and a half dollar
so<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.600> quite<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> bit<00:03:08.959> cheaper<00:03:09.350> I<00:03:09.590> thought<00:03:10.010> I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
so it's quite a bit cheaper I thought I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.440 
so it's quite a bit cheaper I thought I
would<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.250> go<00:03:10.430> ahead<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.730> test<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.300> out<00:03:11.390> and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
would just go ahead and test it out and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.390 
would just go ahead and test it out and
see<00:03:11.750> how<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.230> compares<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.769> care<00:03:12.950> fresh<00:03:15.250> next<00:03:16.250> I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
like the healthy hand folds which are

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.160 
like the healthy hand folds which are
hard<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.160> find<00:04:20.510> but<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.570> didn't<00:04:21.930> think<00:04:21.959> that

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
hard to find but I didn't think that

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.230 
hard to find but I didn't think that
looked<00:04:22.350> too<00:04:22.500> bad<00:04:22.710> for<00:04:23.130> my<00:04:23.310> Syrian<00:04:23.790> hamsters

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
looked too bad for my Syrian hamsters

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.870 
looked too bad for my Syrian hamsters
and<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.930> fat<00:04:25.230> is<00:04:25.470> about<00:04:25.680> four<00:04:25.890> percent<00:04:26.070> so

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
and the fat is about four percent so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.150 
and the fat is about four percent so
once<00:04:27.060> again<00:04:27.210> it's<00:04:27.570> close<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.620> probably<00:04:28.860> not

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
once again it's close it's probably not

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.550 
once again it's close it's probably not
the<00:04:29.370> best<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.570> does<00:04:30.720> look<00:04:30.930> like<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.140> good

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
the best but it does look like a good

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.350 
the best but it does look like a good
thing<00:04:32.040> for<00:04:32.220> him<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.370> try<00:04:32.610> out<00:04:32.790> since<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.240> does

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
thing for him to try out since it does

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.290
