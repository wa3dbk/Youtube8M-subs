 March in the wind wants to have a musical open cards 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.979
 played voice and fought tears 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.450
 many come from a musical home and play already one 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.929
 Stuntman 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
 why 2 the instrument 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.589
 Loretan and trumpets or resorted to 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.519
 Jakarta PG 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.519
 numerous injuries 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.390
 in five cases were 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.450
 the team of musical instrument deliberately plays many customers know 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.460
 what can learn 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 and what we wanted 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.060
 Platzer 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.100
 after game end calculator 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.450
 I already know that 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.690
 recently showed in rural areas 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.060
 No, I am the Col 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 but I do not have a question of the day already 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.740
 a game 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 and above all the music plays 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.730
 near his high for the day show Schmiedeberg a reason 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.489
 Emmerich 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.899
 Erichreineke 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.909
 saving money Mama Papa is actively involved 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 listen to the most profound 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 our future want the game won 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 what when where and how can we? 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.970
 Develop the round again 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880
 65 children 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.420
 within four weeks and no one in Formula 1 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.300
 copes well with our new album 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.800
 Lengerich 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 overtake 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.710
 the cinema comedy Malta, where she did not make much conscious decision 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.200
 we have encountered great worries and problems 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.499
 and sing 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:19.939
 even the love children then actually in from up 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.289
 to bring a peak performance 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.390
 that's a test run that percent 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.639
 the self-employed are the locals 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.529
 chorus singing singly every activity that is 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.980
 Children are those new come motivated for the second it is important 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.329
 that the goal 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.139
 The environment here that is at the boarding school in Monaco that is now just like it 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.389
 well here 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.389
 and then you can also perform accordingly by the monkeys 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.400
 is that the performance 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.139
 Claims from Rome 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.659
 or is it that they just say that I'm here for performance 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.309
 on 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.549
 in some it is so that all on a large part I would say 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.479
 you have to absolutely demand the performance 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:11.289
 and percent that actually happens so Roth the kids need Merck now 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.519
 wants how big is actually for the ultimate scale 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.559
 they are fast behind them and they want a majority 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.419
 So I've always done that right, I have to say that 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.559
 There are funds that should be on the idea of ​​the cash registers the small then often on 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.659
 Stations are the fortune tellers they are processes the most satisfied it already works 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.400
 not again 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.319
 but you have to choose so if you started building Dante's in the evening 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.169
 they have a little bit on what the publisher does not live up to 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.899
 by and large also by most 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:47.889
 and she wants 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.469
 Want to observe rehearsal work 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:54.169
 Listeners are and who they occasionally get pretty loud 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.509
 do you have the feeling that is 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:02.509
 ultimately possible that the bosses want 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.889
 that's the kids to a certain degree of humor 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.909
 Euro 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.909
 was disturbed or hidden 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:18.079
 that is completely different 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.809
 I'm fine if it's here so two worlds assume that held in office 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:27.679
 for a long time a sink I know very well because who far too long with me 

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:28.770
 are all countries 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.620
 I know it very well 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.430
 and how did it look like this would not help if when the earth was me 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.020
 I can loudly get values ​​and in a steep sometimes one is as well as in the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.219
 society 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:46.899
 who wait a bit Fidelity rant and SG Wiesbachtal of all difficulties 

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:49.349
 is still full of do so anyway 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.909
 May around 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:55.550
 You can see that as it meant 000 of it because otherwise the whole thing 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.860
 Thing eaten that is over anyway 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.270
 and when they say that scares off they let the kids do the work for them 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.559
 Tests in the beginning too 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:10.269
 unfamiliar roles to the commitment is not dissuasive, I think that must 

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:11.289
 Not be 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:12.870
 but 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.970
 March in Kosovo does not mean that I have to get used to it but you 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.430
 know that happens then 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.259
 Percent e would bring your own home more 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:29.279
 the ministry had not cashed in while some even say that 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.860
 some but one percent 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.339
 "That leaves me cold." Remember what it says 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.819
 it is true that he does not do the execution 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.779
 but 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:41.809
 that should not be an excuse, I'm just like I am me 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:45.589
 I'm soo I believe that sometimes you have to increase this kind 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.560
 Where men also have the strength to be a little bit important 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.089
 Normally, it's not me either 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.769
 in a certain case that also percent already more money 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.689
 when I appeared here 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.819
 And she is 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.589
 there is not a meter more and that can finally be done to those 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.589
 hear how come the salt Palma Pictures 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.230
 The chick's studies hardly differed from most involved 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.230
 with all the advantages and problems of boarders 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.489
 the life in the community requires from the students a right class 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.190
 that is even more important here than in other boarding schools 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.130
 April focuses on the community performance coach itself 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.680
 all have to subordinate 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 on the whole day's routine have 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.999
 that the children have less wrong than their peers clearly ever 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:43.999
 By age up to three hours of music are on the program every day 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.520
 before concerts even more and then the concerts themselves are added 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.699
 Four age groups each have a dining room according to these age groups 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.699
 also the degree of freedoms divided into the students 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.599
 Dr 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.919
 he explains 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.050
 fck-coach 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.280
 The study is not a boarding school in the true sense of the cuddly on 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.400
 state schools 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.250
 ten students like everyone else and that brings Aland potential for conflict 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.039
 There are situations where clear priorities are set between school and Cork 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.419
 Need to become 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.090
 so that at least the school performance behind the choir is not back 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.389
 The study shows educators and supervised by age group 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.509
 Civil service workers help with homework
