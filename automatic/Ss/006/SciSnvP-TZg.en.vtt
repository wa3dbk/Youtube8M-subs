could get it up to like 60 64 47 Oh 64%

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
could get it up to like 60 64 47 Oh 64%
that's<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> wanted<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> say<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.570> that's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that's what I wanted to say but that's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.539 
that's what I wanted to say but that's
not<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> major<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
not really a major thing so I'm just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
not really a major thing so I'm just
gonna<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> flat<00:01:09.210> damage<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> yeah

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
gonna go for a flat damage and yeah

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.990 
gonna go for a flat damage and yeah
that's<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.490> rollin<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.820> right

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's that's what we rollin with right

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
that's that's what we rollin with right
now<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.720> go<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
now so I think we should go on to the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.310 
now so I think we should go on to the
bosses<00:01:14.220> both<00:01:14.760> normal<00:01:15.299> mode<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> expert<00:01:16.200> mode

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
bosses both normal mode and expert mode

00:01:16.320 --> 00:03:32.070 
bosses both normal mode and expert mode
so<00:01:16.590> let's<00:01:17.009> kick<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:17.490> right<00:01:17.670> now

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.680 

and<00:03:32.800> there<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.520> have<00:03:33.550> it<00:03:33.880> now<00:03:33.910> honestly<00:03:34.420> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
and there you have it now honestly that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.350 
and there you have it now honestly that
kind<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.900> shows<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:36.370> didn't<00:03:36.640> go<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:36.940> expert

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
kind of shows we didn't go for expert

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.000 
kind of shows we didn't go for expert
for<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.600> good<00:03:37.810> reason<00:03:37.960> because<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:38.650> took<00:03:38.830> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
for a good reason because this took a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.800 
for a good reason because this took a
lot<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.760> time<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.210> actually<00:03:40.420> kill<00:03:40.690> these

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810

bosses with a flying knife now cool part
would<00:03:43.150> be<00:03:43.300> if<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:43.690> could<00:03:43.780> actually<00:03:43.930> stack<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
would be if we could actually stack the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.710 
would be if we could actually stack the
applying<00:03:45.250> knives<00:03:45.490> very<00:03:45.820> much<00:03:46.240> like<00:03:46.420> them<00:03:46.540> like

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
applying knives very much like them like

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.150 
applying knives very much like them like
this<00:03:46.930> cuz<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.290> stuff<00:03:47.530> like<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.830> if<00:03:47.980> we<00:03:48.040> can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
this cuz that stuff like that if we can

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.770 
this cuz that stuff like that if we can
actually<00:03:48.280> stack<00:03:48.700> them<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.120> have<00:03:49.510> multiple

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
actually stack them and have multiple

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.050 
actually stack them and have multiple
instances<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.740> knives<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.610> following<00:03:51.970> our

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
instances of knives just following our

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.430 
instances of knives just following our
cursor<00:03:52.480> around<00:03:52.570> like<00:03:52.870> kind<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.080> swirling

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
cursor around like kind of swirling

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.560 
cursor around like kind of swirling
around<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.920> know<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.790> foursome<00:03:55.180> like<00:03:55.390> that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
around you know in a foursome like that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.120 
around you know in a foursome like that
that'd<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.900> an<00:03:56.020> absolutely<00:03:56.440> amazing<00:03:56.590> thing<00:03:57.010> it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
that'd be an absolutely amazing thing it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.010 
that'd be an absolutely amazing thing it
will<00:03:57.250> also<00:03:57.400> do<00:03:57.580> more<00:03:57.730> damage<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.210> stuff<00:03:58.420> but

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
will also do more damage and stuff but

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.290 
will also do more damage and stuff but
no<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.560> would<00:03:59.920> not<00:04:00.070> recommend<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.880> expert

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
no I would not recommend this on expert

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.880 
no I would not recommend this on expert
it's<00:04:01.660> still<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.960> pretty<00:04:02.260> cool<00:04:02.470> weapon<00:04:02.770> on

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
it's still a pretty cool weapon on

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.290 
it's still a pretty cool weapon on
honestly<00:04:03.250> it's<00:04:03.370> kind<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.550> fun<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.760> bounce<00:04:04.060> it

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
honestly it's kind of fun to bounce it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.120 
honestly it's kind of fun to bounce it
back<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.870> forth<00:04:05.020> like<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.230> on<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
back and forth like this on the

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.130 
back and forth like this on the
destroyer<00:04:06.790> especially<00:04:07.270> I<00:04:07.300> did<00:04:07.540> expect<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.080> to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
destroyer especially I did expect it to

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.330 
destroyer especially I did expect it to
be<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> little<00:04:08.530> bit<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:08.800> efficient<00:04:09.160> on<00:04:09.250> a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
be a little bit more efficient on a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.490 
be a little bit more efficient on a
destroyer<00:04:09.670> but<00:04:10.300> it's<00:04:10.480> just<00:04:10.660> not<00:04:10.840> backing<00:04:11.170> that

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
destroyer but it's just not backing that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.380 
destroyer but it's just not backing that
much<00:04:11.680> I'm<00:04:11.830> just<00:04:12.070> not<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.940> much<00:04:13.120> damage

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
much I'm just not that much damage

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.120 
much I'm just not that much damage
honestly<00:04:13.900> if<00:04:14.200> he<00:04:14.230> puffed<00:04:14.500> up<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:14.680> endgame

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
honestly if he puffed up with endgame

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.570 
honestly if he puffed up with endgame
