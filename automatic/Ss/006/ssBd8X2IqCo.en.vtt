up<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.700> they<00:03:58.910> hear<00:03:59.360> because<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:01.070> do<00:04:01.310> this

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
up what they hear because I can do this

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.990 
up what they hear because I can do this
I<00:04:01.880> can<00:04:02.720> even<00:04:03.110> do<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.890> isolate<00:04:04.520> my<00:04:04.730> body

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000

and it's not connected with the rest of
me<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.120> hold<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:09.050> in<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.290> middle<00:04:09.620> because<00:04:10.130> when

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
me so hold it in the middle because when

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.880 
me so hold it in the middle because when
this<00:04:10.670> rotates<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.630> should<00:04:12.140> feel<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.560> all<00:04:12.830> the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
this rotates I should feel it all the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.950 
this rotates I should feel it all the
way<00:04:13.040> down<00:04:13.250> through<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.580> middle<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.150> go<00:04:14.630> one

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
way down through the middle and go one

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.670 
way down through the middle and go one
two<00:04:15.580> three<00:04:16.580> end<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:17.030> four<00:04:17.299> okay<00:04:17.660> since<00:04:18.560> you're

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680
