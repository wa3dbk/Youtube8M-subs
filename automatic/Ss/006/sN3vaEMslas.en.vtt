00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
at that I've been playing for probably

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.010

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
about 10 minutes not even 10 minutes and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.830 
about 10 minutes not even 10 minutes and
I<00:04:50.410> just<00:04:50.560> got<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.770> jackpot<00:04:51.280> achievement<00:04:51.820> uh

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.120

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
now yeah I guess I should explain

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.410 
now yeah I guess I should explain
something<00:05:07.630> else<00:05:07.870> about<00:05:08.170> this<00:05:09.210> there<00:05:10.210> we<00:05:10.300> go

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
something else about this there we go

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.420 
something else about this there we go
