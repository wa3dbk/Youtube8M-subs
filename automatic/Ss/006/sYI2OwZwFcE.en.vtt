mean you'll see the players take it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.580 
mean you'll see the players take it
often<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.049> big<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.380> deal<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
often but it's not as big of a deal as

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.969 
often but it's not as big of a deal as
if<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.369> were<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> outside<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
if they were on the outside I like the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.800 
if they were on the outside I like the
Xel'Naga<00:01:17.340> tower<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.580> mainly<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> keep<00:01:18.420> an<00:01:18.720> eye

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
Xel'Naga tower is mainly to keep an eye

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
Xel'Naga tower is mainly to keep an eye
on<00:01:18.869> four<00:01:19.350> drops<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:20.130> any<00:01:20.790> backdoor<00:01:21.180> action

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
on four drops or any backdoor action

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.789 
on four drops or any backdoor action
that's<00:01:21.930> coming<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.680> middle

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that's coming when it's in the middle

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
that's coming when it's in the middle
like<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.119> players<00:01:24.360> usually<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.900> way

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
like that but the players usually go way

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
like that but the players usually go way
around<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> anyways<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> attack<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.540> map

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
around it anyways to attack on this map

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
around it anyways to attack on this map
I<00:01:28.020> mean<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.590> often<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.490> mean<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> guess

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
I mean they don't often I mean I guess

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.310 
I mean they don't often I mean I guess
they<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
they will go through here but it's just

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
they will go through here but it's just
not<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.740> doesn't<00:01:31.979> seem<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> big<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
not just doesn't seem like it's a big of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.010 
not just doesn't seem like it's a big of
deal<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:33.810> maps<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.840> mean

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
deal as it is on some maps but I mean

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.359 
deal as it is on some maps but I mean
there's<00:01:37.200> el<00:01:37.409> Naga<00:01:37.650> tower<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
there's el Naga tower on them on the

they're up to this one Bell service

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
they're up to this one Bell service
stage<00:01:52.290> where<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.979> SCV<00:01:53.579> ago<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.149> might

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
stage where is this SCV ago and we might

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410 
stage where is this SCV ago and we might
get<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:54.930> trickery<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.420> innovations

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
get a little trickery this innovations

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
get a little trickery this innovations
sav<00:01:58.110> did<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.890> guy<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.340> he's<00:01:59.430> kind

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
sav did not see this guy and he's kind

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
sav did not see this guy and he's kind
of<00:01:59.790> taking<00:02:00.299> him<00:02:00.390> quite<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> meandering

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of taking him quite the meandering

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
of taking him quite the meandering
around<00:02:01.500> looks<00:02:01.920> like<00:02:02.070> i<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.939> he<00:02:03.299> might<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.479> up

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
around looks like i think he might be up

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.370 
around looks like i think he might be up
to<00:02:03.750> no<00:02:03.899> good<00:02:05.360> yeah<00:02:06.360> flame<00:02:06.600> might<00:02:06.930> be<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> no

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
to no good yeah flame might be up to no

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
to no good yeah flame might be up to no
good<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:07.680> he's<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.069> checking<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.879> if

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good or he's just checking out to see if

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.309 
good or he's just checking out to see if
innovations<00:02:09.629> doing<00:02:09.869> anything

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
innovations doing anything

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.330 
innovations doing anything
tricky<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.439> innovations<00:02:13.859> SCV

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
tricky but there is innovations SCV

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.039 
tricky but there is innovations SCV
right<00:02:14.519> there<00:02:14.700> scouting<00:02:15.150> everything<00:02:15.540> out<00:02:15.689> he

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
right there scouting everything out he

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.300 
right there scouting everything out he
saw<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.260> factory<00:02:16.769> go<00:02:16.920> down<00:02:18.620> innovation<00:02:19.620> does

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
saw the factory go down innovation does

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.589 
saw the factory go down innovation does
not<00:02:20.489> have<00:02:20.639> his<00:02:20.730> own<00:02:20.879> factory<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.359> way<00:02:21.480> he's

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
not have his own factory on the way he's

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.660 
not have his own factory on the way he's
got<00:02:21.719> double<00:02:22.530> supply<00:02:22.769> depots<00:02:23.069> his<00:02:23.189> wall<00:02:23.370> off<00:02:23.519> is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
got double supply depots his wall off is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.910 
got double supply depots his wall off is
there<00:02:23.849> there<00:02:24.420> goes<00:02:24.599> innovations<00:02:25.200> factory

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
there there goes innovations factory

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.929 
there there goes innovations factory
looks<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.189> he's<00:02:26.340> always<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.609> step<00:02:26.730> behind

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
looks like he's always a step behind

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.720 
looks like he's always a step behind
Meru<00:02:27.780> which<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.170> pretty<00:02:28.950> impressive<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.519> now

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
Meru which is pretty impressive and now

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.099 
Meru which is pretty impressive and now
here's<00:02:29.969> the<00:02:30.090> SUV<00:02:30.480> let's<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:30.840> what<00:02:30.930> he<00:02:30.989> throws

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
here's the SUV let's see what he throws

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.449 
here's the SUV let's see what he throws
down<00:02:31.379> looks<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.680> maybe<00:02:31.980> he'll<00:02:32.159> do<00:02:32.250> another

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
down looks like maybe he'll do another

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.449 
down looks like maybe he'll do another
banshee<00:02:33.530> but<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.799> starport<00:02:35.099> way<00:02:35.250> over

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
banshee but put the starport way over

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.619 
banshee but put the starport way over
here<00:02:35.639> well<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.819> guess<00:02:35.969> we'll<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.329> see<00:02:36.510> what

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
here well I guess we'll have to see what

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.569 
here well I guess we'll have to see what
he<00:02:36.750> does<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.739> have<00:02:37.859> a<00:02:37.889> marine<00:02:38.219> on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> way<00:02:38.519> from

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
he does we have a marine on the way from

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.989 
he does we have a marine on the way from
innovation<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.400> doesn't<00:02:41.639> look<00:02:41.730> like<00:02:41.790> we

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:41.999 
innovation and it doesn't look like we

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.720 
innovation and it doesn't look like we
have<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.139> he<00:02:43.409> Marines<00:02:43.739> out<00:02:43.889> for<00:02:44.099> marui<00:02:44.489> but

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
have it and he Marines out for marui but

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.979 
have it and he Marines out for marui but
he<00:02:44.790> does<00:02:44.909> have<00:02:45.030> his<00:02:45.060> factory<00:02:45.480> almost<00:02:45.780> done

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
he does have his factory almost done

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.409 
he does have his factory almost done
which<00:02:46.139> means<00:02:46.379> he<00:02:46.530> may<00:02:46.739> throw<00:02:47.669> it<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> star

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
which means he may throw it on a star

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:51.110 
which means he may throw it on a star
port<00:02:48.629> as<00:02:48.719> soon<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.189> factory<00:02:50.189> is<00:02:50.310> done<00:02:50.549> and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
port as soon as that factory is done and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.729 
port as soon as that factory is done and
look<00:02:51.239> at<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.389> timing<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:51.989> practice<00:02:52.560> his

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
look at the timing on this practice his

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.409 
look at the timing on this practice his
timing<00:02:53.069> guys<00:02:53.189> cuz<00:02:53.370> look<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.609> look<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.269> his

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
timing guys cuz look at look at his

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.050 
timing guys cuz look at look at his
money<00:02:54.659> his<00:02:55.379> factory<00:02:55.859> just<00:02:56.159> finished<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:56.879> he

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
money his factory just finished and he

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.539 
money his factory just finished and he
can<00:02:57.209> build<00:02:57.299> his<00:02:57.480> starboard<00:02:58.099> it's<00:02:59.099> just<00:02:59.310> crazy

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
can build his starboard it's just crazy

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.649 
can build his starboard it's just crazy
look<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.939> you<00:03:00.000> built<00:03:00.150> something<00:03:00.269> else

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
look like you built something else

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.129 
look like you built something else
instead<00:03:02.150> yep<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> threw<00:03:03.449> down<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.989> right

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
instead yep you threw down all right

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.280 
instead yep you threw down all right
just<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:05.189> weird<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.959> he<00:03:07.019> goes<00:03:07.169> there

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
just that's weird there he goes there

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.379 
just that's weird there he goes there
goes<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> star<00:03:07.769> port<00:03:08.010> always<00:03:08.969> look<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.329> you

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
goes a star port always look like you

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.209 
goes a star port always look like you
ran<00:03:09.689> off<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> put<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.169> somewhere<00:03:10.290> else<00:03:10.379> so<00:03:11.129> you

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
ran off to put it somewhere else so you

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.530 
ran off to put it somewhere else so you
did<00:03:11.310> throw<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.549> star<00:03:11.669> but<00:03:11.879> the<00:03:11.939> timing<00:03:12.239> on

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
did throw in a star but the timing on

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.420 
did throw in a star but the timing on
these<00:03:12.780> players<00:03:13.409> is<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.859> crazy<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.370> like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
these players is just crazy it's like

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.009 
these players is just crazy it's like
soon<00:03:14.669> as<00:03:14.759> that<00:03:14.849> factory's<00:03:15.239> done<00:03:15.269> he<00:03:15.900> had

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
soon as that factory's done he had

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.140 
soon as that factory's done he had
enough<00:03:16.319> money<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:17.310> throw<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.549> on<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.639> star<00:03:17.879> port

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
so if you need to practice a build

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.860 
so if you need to practice a build
practice<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.060> guys<00:03:21.239> build<00:03:21.479> it<00:03:21.599> so<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:21.720> leave

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
practice these guys build it so I leave

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.869 
practice these guys build it so I leave
the<00:03:21.959> protection<00:03:22.079> tab<00:03:22.470> up<00:03:22.650> makes<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.669> very<00:03:23.759> easy

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
the protection tab up makes it very easy

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.360 
the protection tab up makes it very easy
for<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.389> guys<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.750> follow<00:03:24.900> their<00:03:25.680> builds<00:03:26.159> and

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
for you guys to follow their builds and

for you guys to follow their builds and
then<00:03:26.579> practice<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.389> then<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:29.009> know<00:03:29.099> if

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
then practice it and then you know if

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.710 
then practice it and then you know if
you<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.459> get<00:03:29.549> as<00:03:29.639> fast<00:03:29.790> as<00:03:29.939> these<00:03:30.090> guys<00:03:30.239> it's

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
you can get as fast as these guys it's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.229 
you can get as fast as these guys it's
it's<00:03:31.259> pretty<00:03:31.590> scary<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.579> what<00:03:32.849> they<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.030> do

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
it's pretty scary and what they can do

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.550 
it's pretty scary and what they can do
and<00:03:33.269> what<00:03:33.449> they<00:03:33.599> can<00:03:33.659> get<00:03:33.780> out<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.199> a<00:03:34.349> matter<00:03:34.470> of

and what they can get out in a matter of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.990 
and what they can get out in a matter of
time<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.590> double<00:03:37.949> gas<00:03:38.099> for<00:03:38.310> innovation<00:03:38.729> we<00:03:38.849> do

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
time the double gas for innovation we do

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.249 
time the double gas for innovation we do
not<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.269> an<00:03:39.419> expansion<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.109> way<00:03:40.199> for

not have an expansion on the way for

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.580 
not have an expansion on the way for
either<00:03:40.650> player<00:03:40.949> looks<00:03:41.669> like<00:03:41.849> we<00:03:42.090> do<00:03:42.239> have

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
either player looks like we do have

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.749 
either player looks like we do have
doesn't<00:03:43.590> like<00:03:43.739> only<00:03:44.129> have<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> banshee<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.699> the

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
doesn't like only have a banshee on the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.179 
doesn't like only have a banshee on the
way<00:03:44.909> have<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.060> shuttle<00:03:45.389> on<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:46.379> medevac<00:03:46.919> on<00:03:47.099> the

way have a shuttle on the medevac on the

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.309 
way have a shuttle on the medevac on the
way<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.639> I<00:03:47.989> definitely<00:03:48.989> thought<00:03:49.229> it

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
way so that's I definitely thought it

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.229 
way so that's I definitely thought it
was<00:03:49.409> going<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> banshee<00:03:49.979> however<00:03:50.609> here

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
was going to be a banshee however here

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
comes a couple of Marines and it looks

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.459 
comes a couple of Marines and it looks
like<00:03:54.419> we're<00:03:54.629> going<00:03:54.719> to<00:03:54.780> get<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.959> pretty<00:03:55.409> early

SUV's<00:04:32.880> couple<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:33.630> CDs<00:04:33.930> go<00:04:33.960> down<00:04:34.229> there<00:04:34.800> goes

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
SUV's couple I CDs go down there goes

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.680 
SUV's couple I CDs go down there goes
the<00:04:35.160> brave<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.610> dropping<00:04:35.880> a<00:04:35.970> sentry<00:04:36.360> turret

the brave and dropping a sentry turret
so<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.050> Raven<00:04:37.380> although<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.800> meant<00:04:38.009> for

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
so this is Raven although is meant for

so this is Raven although is meant for
Banshee<00:04:39.060> definitely<00:04:40.050> going<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.229> help<00:04:40.319> do<00:04:40.500> in

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
Banshee definitely going to help do in

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.800 
Banshee definitely going to help do in
sub<00:04:40.770> defense<00:04:41.099> so<00:04:41.430> that's<00:04:41.669> pretty<00:04:42.509> interesting

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
sub defense so that's pretty interesting

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.490 
sub defense so that's pretty interesting
we<00:04:43.169> only<00:04:43.319> lost<00:04:43.560> two<00:04:45.139> innovation<00:04:46.139> only<00:04:46.319> lost

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
we only lost two innovation only lost

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.589 
we only lost two innovation only lost
two<00:04:46.680> workers<00:04:46.889> to<00:04:47.520> Barker's<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.120> maybe<00:04:48.330> two
