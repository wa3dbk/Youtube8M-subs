 hello youtube pajeros here fucking 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.010
 new your friend kira 8,598 now with a 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 small tutorial on how to play maps of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 a single player in the custom halo 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.519
 edition for this first let's go to 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.920
 activate the game console this is very 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.869
 simple let's go to the game's shortcut 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.880
 and we wrote the following in the option 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.880
 of properties where it says destiny 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.070
 where it says destination indicates where it is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.379
 installed its halo it and at the end it says with 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.180
 I solÃ© after a good script this is 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.870
 very likely that they do not get it so 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 we are going to put it to follow me step by step 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 they tighten space then hyphen and without leaving 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.100
 space write with sun 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.220
 very well now just give him apply and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 then accept and your 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.270
 console now we open the halo is for 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.910
 check if they have done well or the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.400
 shit jejeje well press the key that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.560
 is below the esq key on the side of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.690
 the horizontal numbers above the tav 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.970
 in upper left diagonal direction 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.180
 of the letter q should appear those 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.180
 letters 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.200
 or halo 3 but we also find maps 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.030
 with guardians where you're free of 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.580
 kill whoever and there are no goals 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 Well, choose the one you want, I'll choose 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.150
 a light one and that is not the name 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.399
 hard to remember this is very 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.680
 important to remember exactly 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.050
 the name of the map to be able to play it 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.020
 its lowercase and capital letters or scripts what 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.240
 What do you have to remember? 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.310
 to make sure they are maps of a 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.830
 only player in its characteristics says 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.630
 I modify single player or something like that very 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.730
 well I have already chosen the map they give 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.800
 Download the download delay 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.140
 It depends on how much you weigh the file and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.210
 clear your internet connection I do not 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.460
 I'm going to download because I already have that map 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.830
 I recommend that you download it to your 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.320
 desktop already downloaded will be a file 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.390
 compressed if they just open the folder and 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.460
 copy the map to the desktop is a 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.280
 more file in my case the icon is 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.290
 leave 2 do not know why x good Denle 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.120
 cut and go to where they have 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 installed his halo if I have it on 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.770
 documents I do not know where you have it 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.630
 installed we open the folder, leave them here 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.210
 we go to the folder called maps 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.540
 open the already and paste the file that is the 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.540
 Map 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.170
 I get that because I already had that 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.180
 map hahaha good does not matter already stuck 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 the map in the maps folder now we open 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.490
 the halo is now turn on the console and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.740
 they know what buttons and if they forgot it is 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.420
 the one below the key esq 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.510
 haha they saw that it was a verse without 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.540
 effort xd xd xd already with the console 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.090
 on we wrote more after a script 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.550
 low then ship and then leave a 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.890
 space and write the name of the map 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.190
 that were downloaded but write it with 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.440
 accuracy because if it's not going to work 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.660
 then give head and are already ready 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.180
 playing on your map single player x of 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.340
 well these maps can only be played 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 in this way because if we go to 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.459
 multiplayer and we chose a map of a 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.140
 single player 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.270
