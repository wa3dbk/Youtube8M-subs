00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.310
 Alas 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 going 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.460
 slightly I did not feel so at first and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.260
 then in fact what we were dropped a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 few trains and I run them 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.250
 bad at all but when I saw my 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.650
 third coast I saw that I was better 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 that jerry moyes I'm going to focus the tower 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.370
 black and did it alone what he 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.840
 remains the lowest is in this moment 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.479
 so after I waited a little it's true 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.580
 that the next round and rightly in 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.170
 China where he told me guys is talking to you 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.900
 time is back behind our cages 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.970
 and let him go because I had to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 did not feel too bad and two years 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.000
 later but let's say that I said that's 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.000
 left when at noon where come 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.260
 today this third 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.530
 international and 2010 in 2010 ban 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.530
 that the time 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.170
 I appreciate all the more that I come back 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:41.170
 by far and that I want me I heard 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:43.239
 because it's all bonus grime way 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.360
 I think that fake always keeps the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.080
 same idea is that it is the turn of 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.210
 saint pierre we are here to do 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.810
 pleasure 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.810
 pretty low body 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.159
 she 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.909
 this race a simple race test at 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:10.689
 seen from dd france in fifteen days in this 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.920
 which concerns me I did a race at 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.110
 early to wait because saw the 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.750
 course I do not know too much I do not like 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.890
 too much mud we'll say after two 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.269
 cottage towers that I was going very very hard 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 because I really did not have a super 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.870
 sensations on this type of terrain 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.829
 the snag he took the lead in rounds of 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.769
 the end and granny said m I tried to 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.230
 come back and that really in the bailly 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.269
 wake did not arrive and then there he 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.459
 took 10 15 meters he left I 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.909
 tried to manage to settle for the 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.530
 second place 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.000
 I heard I saw that it was coming back 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.639
 by the way to death and mokhtar and come back 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.260
 So I try to manage up to 12 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.260
 years put the ram to the end 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.300
 while only one 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.730
 on a beautiful dynamic do 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.379
 today second here and that's me 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.200
 not satisfied at all I'm really 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.269
 disappointed because I'm no way out of the 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.400
 earthly competition like tonight I 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.139
 respect what theoretical I respect 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.639
 guys there is no problem but I 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.380
 am disappointed in me because I believe 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.660
 really that I was good but it's 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.250
 really at the course that told me my mother 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.800
 who gave me a morale boost 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.150
 I could not run I do it 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.160
 really a weird race I do not know 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.690
 not at all unlike pleasure 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.520
 15th there was there was mud 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.960
 but hey, you could run me as soon as 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.860
 I can run it's true it'll help me 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.690
 that as soon as there are rich is a 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.520
 singing sweet potato before I do 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.620
 really the galley it should be better on 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.840
 the racetrack in fifteen days hoping 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.090
 that rappaz standing cissÃ© rolling I have 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.280
 chances to make a good place like 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.199
 I told my colleague there I have nothing 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.900
 to lose we do not have the team we have nothing 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.120
 so if it really helps 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.220
 if it must cover I'll try to 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.800
 hang up to see a few 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.000
 benchmarks if it goes so much better if that 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.030
 not pass your amp it's through the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.860
 document either really I really have not 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.440
 d goal is really hooked 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.300
 to go all the way if I can do 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.880
 if I can hang a spot in the 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.099
 case it would be very good cca better 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.250
 why not I do not do I would say 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.250
 not no 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:43.540
 however the courses 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.540
 at the time go 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.140
 the word because she was going to take us 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.449
 pranger who come
