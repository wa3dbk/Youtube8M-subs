00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 needs more energy so wrong than if 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.320
 with a shot with a shot 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.600
 The guy I just got was im 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.600
 jump in white 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:48.129
 because that was the one behind the bandage 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:55.090
 yes no nee nee nee nee nee nee no 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:58.390
 So my friend I was just about to fall 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:05.229
 degree in jumping around a pillar and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:08.110
 got me with one had so me 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:13.030
 is one of the last people okay that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:18.310
 was clear I'm one of the last 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.470
 people who just say so but that nee 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:28.080
 So it was either 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:31.110
 mega skill or stop so I have to say 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.840
 my shotgun zb does not do any 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 I hurt and try it now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410
 the masses through 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.140
 i have him i have him several times i 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.479
 believe in a whimsical three times 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.700
 met and it was easy for them 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.759
 bird it simply has zero 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.550
 So I'm interested in yours 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.940
 statement with everything is adjusted 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.200
 only so semih was the problem before 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.140
 all the legendary weapons at the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 Men's effects have the difference 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.910
 make and the values ​​to 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.049
 for example the one on the armor 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.049
 still have so 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.349
 yes, yes 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.760
 So now here against me now 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.790
 claiming is not as hard as now 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.640
 probably against others but it 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 it's frustrating if you have one 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.650
 not shotgun on next distance 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.140
 straight from our team from our team 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.880
 One has brought one in no time 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:31.730
 I think we are both just straight 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:34.780
 bad bad in an extremely good 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.780
 come together 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.550
 but I do not understand, for example 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.140
 So anyway, just like now from the 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.100
 bipedal time instead of who 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.610
 I should never tell this experienced 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.440
 that that we have proved right 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.860
 the others have never been 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:04.870
 six times in succession old up 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.830
 double jump right in front of him with a 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.840
 had won swiss 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.040
 crass ey that people do not manage 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.450
 a cs como on the evening pc now 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.460
 Second protect said babbel 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.870
 So just was a protection against at 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:38.980
 The rest were within the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:54.010
 bubble does one with the one 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:55.570
 contribution to the cape a premiere 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.390
 weapon is not exactly optimal 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.800
 Machine gun would help a hand 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:05.170
 know as the primary weapon an abandoned nuclear 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.720
 is the best for pvp let's go first 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.440
 ne obviously not the chat knows 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.290
 everything better 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.390
 that is an iron rule on the yes 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.059
 apps very easily, frankly 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.249
 I well 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:23.589
 you headshots are always very easy though 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.479
 you train a lot so i'll tell you 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.240
 As I said I keep stressing because 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.999
 I like to play with Frodo in advanced 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.979
 Warfare headshots are also in double 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:38.889
 jump very easy on the pc here 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.099
 I already have a lot of playstation anyway 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.899
 less games than xbox are headshot 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.899
 very difficult in any game 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.430
 you have to look it can do things here 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.789
 learn but I will indeed no thing so 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.619
 or almost two for each 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.779
 I have no stress there 

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:07.439
 I would upload that here shortly thereafter 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.439
 and such a shit 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:17.780
 Sounds then worth mister if baby 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:21.729
 It was an immense honor and a great one 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:26.690
 enjoy this evening as well 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:30.289

 professor professor doctor reha medi was 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:51.169
 Rob Babbel likes to be successful 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:56.930
 I've got gaming 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:07:06.020

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:08.380
