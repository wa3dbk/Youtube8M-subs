00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.660
 the Christian Union supports the largest played last night against Heist Den Haag 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.879
 and that is a tough opponent for the home team 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.430
 de vries will get the first chance of the match but the kitchen will not go there 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.430
 The hague is one of the favorites for the title and therefore comes up quickly 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.439
 head Start 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.529
 to see wesley go far 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.800
 and we hope for a poor devenine 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 then a chance for the first time nothing 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
 beautiful palace and pieter katwijker 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.460
 but the hague is not impressed and within 30 seconds it is already e2 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.090
 and then it goes fast 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.670
 he is that with all martin gate foreigners can play also arose 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.340
 score on the conveyor belt 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.010
 the team runs to 5th oath 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.220
 for the first time is trying but then but simply do not have the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.000
 qualities to make a hague difficult 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.670
 just before the end of the first period but the hague the 6 one and the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.360
 match is actually over 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.150
 goalkeeper jet hombeek determined and will be replaced in the second period by 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.010
 garden houses store 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 The referee made a boeing for the start of the second period 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 the start well before the first race they play work and let life shoot them 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 touch 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.280
 briefly to a handsome keeper hazewinkel twice 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 hazewinkel is playing a match for the first time in five years 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.720
 he was just going to shorten the pump 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 I think you are missing an accident the injured people blow up Brussels third 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.040
 to be the keeper 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.380
 justice is giving something back the competition is no longer a competition 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.870
 The hague plays with his opponent, it is clearly two sizes too big 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.680
 the geniep is parked and even a goal 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.590
 it was at the end of the second period 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.750
 for this the council 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.020
 in the third period the first ones start so given the management we have 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.069
 get slaughtered 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.749
 a little within two minutes even two bogeys 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.089
 at the police 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.399
 the difference is that only 4 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.489
 I think the hague is far too little 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.489
 keeper simply passed the front runners 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.070
 then an outbreak of 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.249
 nothing new to bring our 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.249
 can be 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.869
 the direct relationship goal for the Christian Union 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.869
 the harenaren walk further for a few minutes 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.249
 france télécom is beaten four more times 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.249
 still know how much power to stop 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.619
 just before the end, he shoots in his last goal 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:56.409
 He faced a shameful 15th 7 defeat for the first race 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.559
 the crisis will return home next Thursday 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.879
 we then play the heerenveen flyers during arbitration
