00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
can actually see how you this works what

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.390 
can actually see how you this works what
you<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.340> is<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:42.550> row<00:03:42.880> back<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:44.200> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
you do is you row back in to the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.770 
you do is you row back in to the
compression<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.550> rebound<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.270> suspension

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
compression and rebound the suspension

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.360 
compression and rebound the suspension
what<00:03:47.140> would<00:03:47.260> happen<00:03:47.650> is<00:03:47.770> if<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.070> stayed<00:03:48.340> in

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
what would happen is if you stayed in

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.650 
what would happen is if you stayed in
this<00:03:48.640> position<00:03:49.090> right<00:03:49.239> here

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
this position right here

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.630 
this position right here
see<00:03:50.110> this<00:03:50.260> position<00:03:50.680> Center<00:03:51.010> balance<00:03:51.459> right

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
see this position Center balance right

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.660 
see this position Center balance right
here<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.000> center<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.140> bike<00:03:53.670> you're

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
here in the center of the bike you're

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.040 
here in the center of the bike you're
gonna<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> tendency<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.420> drop<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.870> front

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
gonna have a tendency to drop the front

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.090 
gonna have a tendency to drop the front
wheel<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> lot<00:03:56.500> easier<00:03:56.830> because<00:03:56.890> you're

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
wheel a lot easier because you're

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.620 
wheel a lot easier because you're
waiting<00:03:57.340> more<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.760> front<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.270> need<00:03:58.450> to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
waiting more in the front you need to

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.270 
waiting more in the front you need to
wait<00:03:58.780> in<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.959> back<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.620> need<00:03:59.830> to<00:03:59.980> row

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
wait in the back and you need to row

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.000 
wait in the back and you need to row
into<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.000> compression<00:04:01.570> and<00:04:01.810> rebound<00:04:02.320> because

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
into the compression and rebound because

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.190 
into the compression and rebound because
when<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.400> rebound<00:04:03.910> comes<00:04:04.150> back<00:04:04.360> up<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:05.050> do

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
when this rebound comes back up you do

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.500 
when this rebound comes back up you do
not<00:04:05.440> want<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:05.980> popping<00:04:06.850> up<00:04:06.970> too<00:04:07.120> high<00:04:07.330> cuz

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
not want that popping up too high cuz

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.970 
not want that popping up too high cuz
it's<00:04:07.630> gonna<00:04:07.720> drop<00:04:08.020> your<00:04:08.200> front<00:04:08.410> wheel<00:04:08.590> that'll

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
it's gonna drop your front wheel that'll

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.979 
it's gonna drop your front wheel that'll
keep<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.340> bike<00:04:09.550> level<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.360> let's<00:04:10.540> watch<00:04:10.750> this

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
keep the bike level so let's watch this

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.010 
keep the bike level so let's watch this
number<00:04:11.380> one<00:04:11.620> watch<00:04:12.040> how<00:04:12.190> he<00:04:12.250> crouches<00:04:12.790> down

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
number one watch how he crouches down

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.570 
number one watch how he crouches down
number<00:04:14.020> two<00:04:14.200> watch<00:04:14.470> our<00:04:14.680> feet<00:04:15.190> go<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
number two watch our feet go to the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.349 
number two watch our feet go to the
balls<00:04:15.790> of<00:04:15.970> his<00:04:16.060> feet

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
balls of his feet

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.900 
balls of his feet
but<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.930> most<00:04:17.140> important<00:04:17.680> watch<00:04:18.039> how<00:04:18.340> he<00:04:18.400> rows

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
but the most important watch how he rows

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.719 
but the most important watch how he rows
into<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.780> compression<00:04:20.200> rebound<00:04:20.799> it's<00:04:21.460> very

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
into the compression rebound it's very
