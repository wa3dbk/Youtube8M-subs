00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
as far as basic improv this is how I

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.739 
as far as basic improv this is how I
start<00:01:17.280> students<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.149> no<00:01:18.450> background

know<00:01:58.499> the<00:01:58.649> basic<00:01:59.039> triads<00:01:59.609> once<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> know

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
know the basic triads once you know

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.239 
know the basic triads once you know
through<00:02:00.389> the<00:02:00.509> seven<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.130> to

through the seven then you can go to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.789 
through the seven then you can go to
where<00:02:02.609> I'm<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.779> I<00:02:03.810> start<00:02:04.200> teaching<00:02:04.409> basic

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
where I'm at when I start teaching basic

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.240 
where I'm at when I start teaching basic
improv<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:07.799> say<00:02:07.979> you'll<00:02:08.130> have

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
improv and that is just say you'll have

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.410 
improv and that is just say you'll have
12<00:02:08.580> bar<00:02:08.759> blues<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> basic

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
12 bar blues you have a basic

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.420 
12 bar blues you have a basic
progression<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.630> even<00:02:13.110> 12<00:02:13.350> bar<00:02:13.530> blues<00:02:13.560> what

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
progression here even 12 bar blues what

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.910 
progression here even 12 bar blues what
I<00:02:14.459> would<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.879> my<00:02:15.090> students<00:02:15.629> do<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:16.080> would<00:02:16.709> have

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I would have my students do I would have

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.700 
I would have my students do I would have
them<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.220> play<00:02:17.459> chord<00:02:17.790> tones<00:02:18.090> like

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
them just play chord tones like

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.640 
them just play chord tones like
quarter<00:02:18.980> notes<00:02:19.240> throughout<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.420> song<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
quarter notes throughout the song so the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.680 
quarter notes throughout the song so the
first<00:02:21.890> chord<00:02:22.250> may<00:02:22.460> go<00:02:22.640> for<00:02:22.850> two<00:02:23.000> measures<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
first chord may go for two measures the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.600 
first chord may go for two measures the
second<00:02:24.110> quarter<00:02:24.440> Michael<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.130> measure<00:02:25.310> to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
second quarter Michael for a measure to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.340 
second quarter Michael for a measure to
measure<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.090> whatever<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:27.230> that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
measure you know whatever for that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.440 
measure you know whatever for that
particular<00:02:27.680> kind<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.130> 12<00:02:28.430> bar<00:02:28.610> blues<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.120> I'll

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
particular kind of 12 bar blues and I'll

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.120 
particular kind of 12 bar blues and I'll
have<00:02:29.750> them<00:02:29.900> good<00:02:30.050> let's<00:02:30.230> say<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> first<00:02:30.800> chord

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
have them good let's say the first chord

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:44.790 
have them good let's say the first chord
is<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> D<00:02:31.490> minor<00:02:31.760> 7<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.050> have<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:33.740> 1<00:02:34.130> 2<00:02:34.730> 3

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:53.040 

let's<00:02:45.800> say<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.190> next<00:02:46.400> chord<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.360> G<00:02:47.690> minor<00:02:48.320> 7

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.790 

then<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.140> goes<00:02:54.230> back<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.590> D<00:02:54.710> minor<00:02:59.530> let's<00:03:00.530> say

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
then it goes back to D minor let's say

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.670 
then it goes back to D minor let's say
the<00:03:00.980> next<00:03:01.160> chord<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> 5<00:03:02.060> 7<00:03:02.420> which<00:03:03.200> might<00:03:03.500> be

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
the next chord is a 5 7 which might be

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.850 
the next chord is a 5 7 which might be
an<00:03:03.770> a7<00:03:04.280> run<00:03:04.640> which<00:03:04.790> should<00:03:04.940> be<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> C<00:03:05.810> sharp<00:03:05.840> E<00:03:06.320> G

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
an a7 run which should be a C sharp E G

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.570 
an a7 run which should be a C sharp E G
natural<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.610> then<00:03:07.790> go<00:03:07.940> go<00:03:08.090> go<00:03:12.250> then<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.370> could

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
natural so then go go go then you could

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.340 
natural so then go go go then you could
go<00:03:13.700> back<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.150> Toddie<00:03:14.390> chord<00:03:14.840> which<00:03:15.050> is<00:03:15.200> d

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
go back to the Toddie chord which is d

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:22.960 
go back to the Toddie chord which is d
minor<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.890> what<00:03:22.100> I'm<00:03:22.220> teaching<00:03:22.430> them<00:03:22.730> is

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
minor so so what I'm teaching them is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.690 
minor so so what I'm teaching them is
how<00:03:23.240> to<00:03:23.300> outline<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:24.320> basic<00:03:24.500> triads<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.520> each

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
how to outline the basic triads of each

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.280 
how to outline the basic triads of each
port<00:03:26.060> where<00:03:26.480> they<00:03:26.570> can<00:03:26.720> kind<00:03:26.960> of<00:03:27.050> get<00:03:27.170> around

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
port where they can kind of get around

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.700 
port where they can kind of get around
with<00:03:27.710> that<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.900> would<00:03:30.080> be<00:03:30.170> like<00:03:30.320> step<00:03:30.680> one

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
with that so that would be like step one

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.090 
with that so that would be like step one
if<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:32.180> can<00:03:32.390> if<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.810> don't<00:03:32.960> know<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.830> names

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
if you can if you don't know the names

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.940 
if you can if you don't know the names
of<00:03:34.490> the<00:03:34.640> notes<00:03:34.790> in<00:03:35.120> each<00:03:35.300> chord<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.500> really

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
of the notes in each chord you really

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.620 
of the notes in each chord you really
don't<00:03:37.160> stand<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.520> chance<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:38.060> even<00:03:38.210> begin<00:03:38.600> to

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
don't stand a chance to even begin to

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.170 
don't stand a chance to even begin to
improv<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:40.160> classically<00:03:40.880> trained

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
improv so as a classically trained

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.240 
improv so as a classically trained
person<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.260> how<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.410> think<00:03:42.800> is<00:03:42.920> probably

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
person this is how I think is probably

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.310 
person this is how I think is probably
one<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.550> better<00:03:43.700> ways<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.000> spar<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.720> then

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
one of the better ways to spar and then

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.160 
one of the better ways to spar and then
let's<00:03:46.160> say<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.670> next<00:03:46.700> step<00:03:47.180> would<00:03:47.330> be<00:03:47.390> playing

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
let's say the next step would be playing

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.530 
let's say the next step would be playing
the<00:03:48.290> scales<00:03:48.650> with<00:03:49.610> an<00:03:49.730> X<00:03:49.910> get<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.300> first

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
the scales with an X get the first

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:01.309 
the scales with an X get the first
wouldn't<00:03:50.900> be<00:03:50.960> a<00:03:50.990> D<00:03:51.200> minor<00:03:51.470> scale<00:03:51.680> solo

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:11.920 

or<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:01.830> could<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.550> D<00:04:02.790> blue<00:04:03.030> scales

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.780 

you<00:04:12.200> can<00:04:12.440> do<00:04:12.560> something<00:04:12.860> like<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.190> but<00:04:13.580> so

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
you can do something like that but so

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.400 
you can do something like that but so
now<00:04:13.910> when<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.270> start<00:04:14.569> out<00:04:14.720> with<00:04:14.810> chord<00:04:15.080> tones

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
now when you start out with chord tones

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.000 
now when you start out with chord tones
and<00:04:15.709> then<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.579> figure<00:04:16.940> out<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.269> scale<00:04:17.630> and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
and then you figure out the scale and

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.409 
and then you figure out the scale and
this<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.190> where<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.430> lagina<00:04:19.700> Ebersol<00:04:20.060> bucks

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
this is where the lagina Ebersol bucks

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.150 
this is where the lagina Ebersol bucks
really<00:04:20.600> work<00:04:20.840> well<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.950> think

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
really work well because if you think

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.450 
really work well because if you think
your<00:04:22.280> basic<00:04:22.580> blues<00:04:22.790> scales<00:04:23.150> a<00:04:23.800> d<00:04:24.800> minor<00:04:25.010> seven

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
your basic blues scales a d minor seven

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.430 
your basic blues scales a d minor seven
you<00:04:25.520> play<00:04:25.700> D<00:04:25.910> blues<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.419> G<00:04:26.720> minor<00:04:26.960> seven<00:04:27.350> when

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
you play D blues a G minor seven when

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.260 
you play D blues a G minor seven when
you<00:04:27.530> play<00:04:27.740> G<00:04:27.950> blues<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.430> earn<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.610> 7<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.180> would

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
you play G blues and earn a 7 you would

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.570 
you play G blues and earn a 7 you would
play<00:04:29.450> a<00:04:29.630> blues<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.680> then<00:04:30.980> you<00:04:31.280> start

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
play a blues and so then you start

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.250 
play a blues and so then you start

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
working out the scale work to their

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.780 
working out the scale work to their
corresponding<00:04:36.260> chords<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:36.889> then<00:04:37.400> eventually

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
corresponding chords and then eventually

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.690 
corresponding chords and then eventually
I<00:04:38.440> tell<00:04:39.440> my<00:04:39.620> students<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.070> is<00:04:40.160> like<00:04:40.340> over<00:04:40.550> a

like<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.690> okay<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.930> then<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:08.570> next<00:05:08.600> step

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
like that okay and then the next step

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.950 
like that okay and then the next step
would<00:05:09.290> be<00:05:09.350> I'd<00:05:09.680> say<00:05:10.190> okay<00:05:10.490> let's<00:05:10.729> find<00:05:11.000> the

would be I'd say okay let's find the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.230 
would be I'd say okay let's find the
third<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.770> flat<00:05:13.070> third<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.000> flat

well<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.460> flat<00:05:19.700> third<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.300> third<00:05:20.720> scale

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
well the flat third is a third scale

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.190 
well the flat third is a third scale
degree<00:05:21.140> of<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:22.280> court<00:05:22.669> it's<00:05:23.479> just<00:05:23.720> flat<00:05:23.960> it

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
degree of that court it's just flat it

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.170 
degree of that court it's just flat it
goes<00:05:24.440> in<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.680> blues<00:05:24.950> scale<00:05:25.220> they<00:05:25.580> would<00:05:25.729> flat<00:05:25.970> it

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
goes in a blues scale they would flat it

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.690 
goes in a blues scale they would flat it
so<00:05:26.419> you<00:05:26.930> know<00:05:27.050> if<00:05:27.140> your<00:05:27.289> D<00:05:27.560> if<00:05:27.860> it's<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.100> D<00:05:28.310> minor

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
so you know if your D if it's a D minor

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.719 
so you know if your D if it's a D minor
triad<00:05:29.479> it<00:05:29.690> would<00:05:30.080> be<00:05:30.229> D<00:05:30.470> F<00:05:30.740> natural<00:05:31.070> there's

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
triad it would be D F natural there's

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.840 
triad it would be D F natural there's
your<00:05:32.000> minor<00:05:32.210> third<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.900> then<00:05:33.860> C<00:05:34.130> natural<00:05:34.370> so

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
your minor third a then C natural so

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.029 
your minor third a then C natural so
flat<00:05:35.090> seventh<00:05:35.720> so<00:05:36.350> then<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.740> can<00:05:36.890> just

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
flat seventh so then you can just

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:46.690 
flat seventh so then you can just
practice<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.710> then<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.010> can<00:05:46.160> start<00:05:46.430> playing

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
practice so then you can start playing

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.790 
practice so then you can start playing
around<00:05:46.880> with<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.780> know<00:05:47.840> adding<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.560> lot<00:05:48.770> of

flat thirds going down to the flat
sevens<00:06:57.310> and<00:06:58.310> all<00:06:58.460> of<00:06:58.550> a<00:06:58.610> sudden<00:06:58.640> I'm<00:06:59.150> starting

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
sevens and all of a sudden I'm starting

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.270 
sevens and all of a sudden I'm starting
to<00:06:59.690> play<00:06:59.870> a<00:06:59.900> little<00:07:00.110> blues<00:07:00.440> here<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:00.950> it's

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
to play a little blues here and it's

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.350 
to play a little blues here and it's
working<00:07:01.640> really<00:07:01.790> well

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
working really well

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
working really well
so<00:07:02.810> in<00:07:03.020> review<00:07:03.820> you<00:07:04.820> must<00:07:05.060> understand<00:07:05.870> what<00:07:06.140> a

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
so in review you must understand what a

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.980 
so in review you must understand what a
triad<00:07:07.010> is<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.520> basic<00:07:07.940> chord<00:07:08.270> through<00:07:08.720> the

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
triad is the basic chord through the

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.740 
triad is the basic chord through the
root<00:07:09.530> the<00:07:10.040> third<00:07:10.340> the<00:07:10.610> fifth<00:07:10.910> and<00:07:11.120> the<00:07:11.240> seventh

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
root the third the fifth and the seventh

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.620 
root the third the fifth and the seventh
and<00:07:12.550> then<00:07:13.550> you<00:07:13.730> need<00:07:13.880> to<00:07:13.970> understand<00:07:14.450> maybe

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
and then you need to understand maybe

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.570 
and then you need to understand maybe
the<00:07:14.900> blue<00:07:15.080> scales<00:07:15.500> have<00:07:15.740> a<00:07:15.770> correspond<00:07:16.490> to

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
the blue scales have a correspond to

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.170 
the blue scales have a correspond to
each<00:07:16.760> chord<00:07:17.270> and<00:07:17.540> then<00:07:18.350> you<00:07:19.030> understand<00:07:20.030> how

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
each chord and then you understand how

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.000 
each chord and then you understand how
to<00:07:20.210> play<00:07:20.510> the<00:07:20.690> bass<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:21.050> try<00:07:21.320> it<00:07:21.380> and<00:07:21.770> you<00:07:21.860> can

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
to play the bass you try it and you can

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.650 
to play the bass you try it and you can
work<00:07:22.280> through<00:07:22.550> them<00:07:22.730> and<00:07:22.880> then<00:07:23.240> play<00:07:23.450> the

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
work through them and then play the

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.810 
work through them and then play the
basic<00:07:23.840> scales<00:07:24.500> to<00:07:24.860> work<00:07:25.070> through<00:07:25.310> them<00:07:25.520> and

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
basic scales to work through them and

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.660 
basic scales to work through them and
then<00:07:26.030> eventually<00:07:26.150> you<00:07:26.600> mix<00:07:27.050> it<00:07:27.290> up<00:07:27.490> and<00:07:28.490> then

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.670 
then eventually you mix it up and then

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.610 
then eventually you mix it up and then
lastly<00:07:29.180> you<00:07:29.450> add<00:07:29.630> a<00:07:29.660> lot<00:07:29.900> of<00:07:29.960> weight<00:07:30.230> to<00:07:30.260> the

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
lastly you add a lot of weight to the

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.160 
lastly you add a lot of weight to the
flat<00:07:30.890> third<00:07:31.190> and<00:07:31.520> the<00:07:31.610> flat<00:07:31.820> seven<00:07:32.360> and<00:07:32.510> I

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.170 
flat third and the flat seven and I

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.290 
flat third and the flat seven and I
think<00:07:33.410> what<00:07:33.560> you<00:07:33.710> get<00:07:33.830> at<00:07:33.980> that<00:07:34.010> point<00:07:34.460> I<00:07:34.640> think

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
think what you get at that point I think

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.910 
think what you get at that point I think
will<00:07:35.510> be<00:07:35.630> ready<00:07:35.840> to<00:07:35.990> go<00:07:36.140> to<00:07:36.200> the<00:07:36.500> next<00:07:36.680> video
