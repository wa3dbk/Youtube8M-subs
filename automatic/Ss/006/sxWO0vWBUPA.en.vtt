00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
requested a lot of these some and keep

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.750 
requested a lot of these some and keep
them<00:00:06.299> coming<00:00:06.480> at<00:00:06.660> least<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:06.990> time<00:00:07.049> being

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
them coming at least for the time being

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.520 
them coming at least for the time being
unlike<00:00:08.760> most<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.210> lists<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.080> list<00:00:10.380> is

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
unlike most of my lists this list is

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.610 
unlike most of my lists this list is
going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.830> start<00:00:11.570> unorthodox<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.080> I

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
going to start unorthodox and then I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.990 
going to start unorthodox and then I
think<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> end<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> list<00:00:14.730> will<00:00:14.849> be<00:00:14.940> in

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
think the end of the list will be in

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
think the end of the list will be in
keeping<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:16.049> must<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.320> guys

Bordeaux's<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.800> love<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> black<00:00:20.369> gray<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
Bordeaux's I love the black gray that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.080 
Bordeaux's I love the black gray that
off<00:00:21.330> purplish<00:00:22.320> red<00:00:22.500> color<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.279> great<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.820> know

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
off purplish red color is great I know

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.519 
off purplish red color is great I know
this<00:00:24.420> wouldn't<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.900> alone<00:00:25.140> most

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this wouldn't be this alone most

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
this wouldn't be this alone most
people's<00:00:25.830> list<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.609> actually<00:00:26.820> think<00:00:27.060> there

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
people's list but I actually think there

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.339 
people's list but I actually think there
are<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.539> great<00:00:27.779> color<00:00:27.960> ways<00:00:28.170> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
are a lot of great color ways that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
are a lot of great color ways that
Jordan<00:00:28.619> 7<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.429> more<00:00:29.699> like<00:00:30.150> for

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
Jordan 7 I just like more like for

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
Jordan 7 I just like more like for
instance<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.869> flint<00:00:31.170> grey<00:00:31.410> Jordan<00:00:31.800> sevens

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
instance the flint grey Jordan sevens

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
instance the flint grey Jordan sevens
again<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.239> sure<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> lot<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.140> people<00:00:34.260> wouldn't

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
again I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.069 
again I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't
put<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> shoe<00:00:35.190> as<00:00:35.370> high<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.899> love

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
put this shoe as high but I really love

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
put this shoe as high but I really love
the<00:00:37.200> purple<00:00:37.440> accents<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.520> way<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.820> grey<00:00:39.030> goes

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the purple accents the way the grey goes

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.580 
the purple accents the way the grey goes
with<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> white<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.020> almost<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.559> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
with the white and it's almost like a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
with the white and it's almost like a
purplish<00:00:41.129> gray<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.120> really

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
purplish gray I think it's really really

purplish gray I think it's really really
cool<00:00:42.660> these<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> first

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
cool these are actually one of the first

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
cool these are actually one of the first

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and not something you usually see on a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
and not something you usually see on a
Jordan<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:58.859> why<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> my<00:00:59.489> forced

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this was almost an instant classic for

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730 
this was almost an instant classic for
me<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> love<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> gray<00:01:21.869> accents<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.590> those

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
light blue Icee accents are really cool

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
light blue Icee accents are really cool
again<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.729> most

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
again not something you see on most

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.760 
again not something you see on most
Jordans<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.869> always<00:01:28.110> something<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
Jordans and that's always something that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
Jordans and that's always something that
draws<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.280> eye<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.790> my<00:01:30.180> second<00:01:30.720> slot<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.140> have

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
draws my eye in my second slot I have

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
draws my eye in my second slot I have
what<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.860> most<00:01:32.159> people<00:01:32.400> would<00:01:32.490> put

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
what I think most people would put

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
what I think most people would put
pretty<00:01:32.880> high<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.600> wraptor<00:01:34.140> sevens<00:01:34.619> again

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
pretty high up the wraptor sevens again

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.390 
pretty high up the wraptor sevens again
