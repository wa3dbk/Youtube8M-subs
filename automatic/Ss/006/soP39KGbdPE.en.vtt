why<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.580> happens<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.629> glitch<00:02:16.870> but

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
why this happens it's just a glitch but

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.979 
why this happens it's just a glitch but
if<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:18.580> experienced<00:02:19.239> this<00:02:19.360> glitch<00:02:19.690> and

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
if you have experienced this glitch and

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.350 
if you have experienced this glitch and
you<00:02:20.560> do<00:02:20.709> not<00:02:21.010> want<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.849> your<00:02:21.940> items

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
you do not want to do this to your items

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
you do not want to do this to your items
I<00:02:22.569> would<00:02:22.870> recommend<00:02:23.500> just<00:02:23.620> quitting<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
I would recommend just quitting out a

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100 
I would recommend just quitting out a
few<00:02:24.670> times<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.090> go<00:02:25.269> back<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.840> items

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
few times and go back in and the items

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.020 
few times and go back in and the items
will<00:02:26.290> be<00:02:26.410> normal<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.489> would<00:02:27.670> put<00:02:27.849> these

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
will be normal and I would put these

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.180 
will be normal and I would put these
items<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.750> chest<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.319> they<00:02:29.470> are<00:02:29.530> safe<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.129> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
items in a chest so they are safe on a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.460 
items in a chest so they are safe on a
separate<00:02:30.790> world<00:02:31.000> altogether<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.110> yeah<00:02:32.290> guys
