pictures<00:00:43.489> my<00:00:44.489> board<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> an<00:00:45.089> alterant<00:00:45.839> flex

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
pictures my board is an alterant flex

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.590 
pictures my board is an alterant flex
which<00:00:46.829> means<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> medium<00:00:47.670> flex<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.300> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
which means it's a medium flex and it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.139 
which means it's a medium flex and it's
it's<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.199> for<00:00:49.350> writing<00:00:49.620> part<00:00:50.519> pipe

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it's really good for writing part pipe

standard with all right talking about

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
standard with all right talking about
the<00:01:01.499> base<00:01:01.709> the<00:01:02.549> base<00:01:02.729> is<00:01:02.909> called<00:01:03.179> sintered

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the base the base is called sintered

each insert pack and it actually makes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
each insert pack and it actually makes
the<00:01:33.390> board<00:01:33.659> stronger<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.740> actually

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the board stronger and it's actually

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.660
