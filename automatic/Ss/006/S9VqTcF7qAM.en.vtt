that you're able to clean per hour the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
that you're able to clean per hour the
better<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:50.070> not<00:00:50.190> charging

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
better because you're not charging

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
better because you're not charging
people<00:00:50.760> hourly<00:00:51.329> you're<00:00:51.750> charging<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.289> by

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
people hourly you're charging them by

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 
people hourly you're charging them by
the<00:00:52.559> piece<00:00:53.180> it's<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.570> easier<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> sell<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the piece it's way easier to sell the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
the piece it's way easier to sell the
jobs<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> way<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:57.000> someone<00:00:57.629> else<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
jobs that way because someone else is

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
jobs that way because someone else is
going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> find<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:59.399> can't<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.820> as

going to find out that they can't do as
many<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.199> hour<00:01:02.120> let's<00:01:03.120> take<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
many as you can in an hour let's take a

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
many as you can in an hour let's take a
look<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.629> how<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.489> I'm<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
look and see how they go I'm going to be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.310 
look and see how they go I'm going to be
using<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.799> zero<00:01:07.799> Degree<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
using the zero Degree so I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.160 
using the zero Degree so I
top<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.620> bottom<00:01:12.690> without<00:01:13.690> worrying<00:01:14.050> about
