00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
way that wallpapers steamer the steam

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.660 
way that wallpapers steamer the steam
could<00:00:46.470> actually<00:00:46.620> penetrate<00:00:47.280> through<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
could actually penetrate through that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.730 
could actually penetrate through that
vinyl<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.020> gun<00:00:49.200> remove<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
vinyl so you have to gun remove the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.860 
vinyl so you have to gun remove the
vinyl<00:00:49.860> anyways<00:00:50.400> so<00:00:51.090> we're<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.720> get

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
ribbon often I can see that this is the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.160 
ribbon often I can see that this is the
actual<00:02:50.890> drywall<00:02:51.970> underneath<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.300> it's<00:02:53.870> never

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
been textured but it's been sized and so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.650 
been textured but it's been sized and so
it's<00:02:58.070> kind<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.310> primer<00:02:58.670> on<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.210> stuff<00:02:59.450> and

it's kind of primer on it and stuff and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.690 
it's kind of primer on it and stuff and
it's<00:02:59.840> ready<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.070> don't<00:03:01.130> want<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.400> paint<00:03:01.580> it
