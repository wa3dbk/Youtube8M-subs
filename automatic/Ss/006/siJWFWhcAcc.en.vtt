my name is Kane hawks and we were here

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.970 
my name is Kane hawks and we were here
in<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.189> studio<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.520> where<00:00:20.759> I<00:00:21.800> this<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
in my studio this is where I this is

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.779 
in my studio this is where I this is
where<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> did<00:00:23.700> wicked<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:28.369> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> places

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
where I did wicked one one of the places

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.009 
where I did wicked one one of the places
I<00:00:30.150> guess<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:34.400> this<00:00:35.400> is<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.269> is<00:00:36.330> a<00:00:36.510> studio

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
I guess and this is it this is a studio

album I'm the doctor all came today so
I'm<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.269> here<00:00:45.449> at<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.860> woodys<00:00:48.260> part<00:00:49.260> of

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
I'm kind of here at the woodys part of

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.549 
I'm kind of here at the woodys part of
part<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.979> my<00:00:50.159> practices<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.409> need

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
part of my practices that you need

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.880 
part of my practices that you need
everything<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

like<00:00:59.520> everything<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.510> summer<00:01:00.960> studio<00:01:01.380> is

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
like everything that summer studio is

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.619 
like everything that summer studio is
kind<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> grams<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> say

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
kind of up the grams of you say

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.330 
kind of up the grams of you say
everything<00:01:04.700> everything's<00:01:05.700> wrong<00:01:05.970> material

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
everything everything's wrong material

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
everything everything's wrong material
there's<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:08.670> nothing's<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.840> matter<00:01:10.229> with

there's no nothing's really matter with

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.140 
there's no nothing's really matter with

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
it and forth until it leads and the work

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.460

explaining<00:01:22.470> things<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> project<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.060> sort

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
explaining things is a project that sort

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.910 
explaining things is a project that sort
of<00:01:27.200> based<00:01:28.200> around<00:01:30.320> just<00:01:31.320> based<00:01:31.530> around<00:01:31.710> a

of based around just based around a
diagram<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.910> based<00:01:33.750> around<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.440> of<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
diagram really based around a kind of a

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
diagram really based around a kind of a
sense<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> diagram<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
sense that you can for a diagram of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.820 
sense that you can for a diagram of
something<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.899> kind<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.110> explain

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
something and it kind of explain

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.810 
something and it kind of explain
something<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.240> sense<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:47.190> show<00:01:47.490> was

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
something so in a sense the show was

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.460 
something so in a sense the show was
about<00:01:49.550> like<00:01:50.550> try<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> break<00:01:51.210> break<00:01:51.929> that<00:01:52.229> down

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
about like try to break break that down

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.639 
about like try to break break that down
or<00:01:52.940> trying<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.270> figure<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:56.509> one<00:01:57.649> one

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
or trying to like figure out how one one

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.950 
or trying to like figure out how one one
object<00:01:59.130> might<00:01:59.429> explain<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.179> existence<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.810> an

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
object might explain the existence of an

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980 
object might explain the existence of an
object<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:02.580> have<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.180> watch<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.540> might<00:02:03.840> be

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
object but have that watch it might be

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.020 
object but have that watch it might be
sit<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.450> diagrammatic

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
sit up and a kind of a diagrammatic

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
sit up and a kind of a diagrammatic
diagrammatic<00:02:09.030> form<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:11.850> know<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.299> are

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
diagrammatic form you know in there are

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.620 
diagrammatic form you know in there are
there<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:14.040> definitely<00:02:14.430> definitely<00:02:15.150> like

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
there are definitely definitely like

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.660 
there are definitely definitely like
atoms<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.560> try<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:16.950> work

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
atoms and I try and work

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610 
atoms and I try and work
work<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.450> ways<00:02:18.660> we<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.349> are<00:02:19.470> like

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
work in ways we are there are like

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.530 
work in ways we are there are like
patents<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.400> formulas<00:02:21.770> like<00:02:23.000> means<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
patents and formulas like means and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.470 
patents and formulas like means and
tropes<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:26.280> are<00:02:26.459> continuous<00:02:27.060> through

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
tropes but that are continuous through

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.130 
tropes but that are continuous through
through<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> wood<00:02:28.530> boy<00:02:29.300> here's<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.420> logic<00:02:30.810> for

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
through the wood boy here's a logic for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.100 
through the wood boy here's a logic for
the<00:02:31.260> whip<00:02:31.700> explaining<00:02:32.700> things<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.150> went<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
the whip explaining things I went out of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.770 
the whip explaining things I went out of
my<00:02:34.230> way<00:02:34.350> really<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:36.270> wanted<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.600> do<00:02:36.750> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
my way really I really wanted to do a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.729 
my way really I really wanted to do a
show<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:38.840> alienated<00:02:39.840> as<00:02:40.170> many<00:02:40.380> people

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
show that just alienated as many people

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.259 
show that just alienated as many people
as<00:02:40.830> possible<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.610> there's<00:02:44.819> all<00:02:44.940> sorts<00:02:45.209> of

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
as possible so there's all sorts of

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.880 
as possible so there's all sorts of
things<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> show<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.290> I've<00:02:46.410> come<00:02:46.650> upon

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
things in the show that I've come upon

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.380 
things in the show that I've come upon
comfortable<00:02:49.519> not<00:02:50.519> very<00:02:50.760> nice<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.530> also<00:02:53.390> at

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
comfortable not very nice but also at

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.000 
comfortable not very nice but also at
the<00:02:54.569> same<00:02:54.600> time<00:02:57.049> try<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.110> try<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.769> and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the same time try it try to like and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.970 
the same time try it try to like and
view<00:02:59.250> things<00:02:59.519> with<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> sense<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.269> like<00:03:00.980> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
view things with the sense of like that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.100 
view things with the sense of like that
might<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.340> profound<00:03:02.850> or<00:03:03.269> something<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.049> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
might be profound or something so you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.840 
might be profound or something so you
kind<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.440> like<00:03:04.590> stick<00:03:04.860> around<00:03:05.130> point<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.730> is

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
kind of like stick around point that is

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.509 
kind of like stick around point that is
profound<00:03:06.239> thing<00:03:06.650> but<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:07.920> alienating

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
profound thing but it's just alienating

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.840 
profound thing but it's just alienating
you<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> whole<00:03:08.880> time<00:03:10.220> here<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.730> are

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
you the whole time here are there are

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
you the whole time here are there are
quite<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.090> few<00:03:12.180> elements<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.410> show<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:14.010> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
quite a few elements on this show that I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.780
