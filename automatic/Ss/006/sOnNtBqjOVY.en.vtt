the arrow keys accelerate reverse left

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.080 
the arrow keys accelerate reverse left
right<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.530> kind<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> most<00:02:16.310> boring<00:02:16.610> drive

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.339 

some<00:03:33.849> of<00:03:33.969> these<00:03:34.030> tracks<00:03:34.359> I<00:03:34.689> think<00:03:34.989> would<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.260> be

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349

too<00:03:35.560> out<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.739> place<00:03:36.010> in<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.250> game<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.609> say

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
too out of place in the game like say

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.929 
too out of place in the game like say
Mario<00:03:37.659> Kart<00:03:38.049> or<00:03:38.260> Crash<00:03:38.650> Team<00:03:38.680> Racing<00:03:39.040> or<00:03:39.879> a

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing or a

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.849 
Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing or a
game<00:03:40.359> where<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.629> drive<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:40.870> grey<00:03:41.140> sedan<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.769> an

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
game where you drive a grey sedan in an

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.280 
game where you drive a grey sedan in an
oppressed<00:03:42.219> communist<00:03:42.700> city<00:03:43.079> it's<00:03:44.079> like<00:03:44.170> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
oppressed communist city it's like a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.910 
oppressed communist city it's like a
glove

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
glove

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.949 
glove
it<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.189> a<00:03:45.219> bit<00:03:45.489> too<00:03:45.700> loud<00:03:45.969> though<00:03:46.359> but<00:03:46.629> that's<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
it is a bit too loud though but that's a

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.690 
it is a bit too loud though but that's a
positive<00:03:47.170> because<00:03:47.980> then<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.370> don't<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.579> to

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
positive because then you don't have to

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.670 
positive because then you don't have to
hear<00:03:48.939> the<00:03:49.090> god-awful<00:03:49.569> engine<00:03:50.139> noises<00:03:50.290> from

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
hear the god-awful engine noises from

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:01.819

your<00:03:50.829> car<00:03:51.099> listen<00:03:51.939> to<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.150> for<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.420> second

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.960 

speaking<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:02.920> cars<00:04:03.159> you<00:04:03.310> may<00:04:03.459> have<00:04:03.609> noticed

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
speaking of cars you may have noticed

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.210 
speaking of cars you may have noticed
that<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.269> aren't<00:04:04.870> actually<00:04:05.409> racing<00:04:06.010> anybody

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
that you aren't actually racing anybody

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.759 
that you aren't actually racing anybody
in<00:04:06.519> this<00:04:06.639> game<00:04:06.849> yep<00:04:07.540> you're<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.930> only<00:04:08.530> one

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
in this game yep you're the only one

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.800 
in this game yep you're the only one
racing<00:04:09.250> making<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.909> I<00:04:10.060> think<00:04:10.359> a<00:04:10.480> pretty

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
racing making it I think a pretty

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.629 
racing making it I think a pretty
accurate<00:04:11.019> representation<00:04:11.950> of<00:04:12.040> North<00:04:12.250> Korean

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
accurate representation of North Korean

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.250 
accurate representation of North Korean
traffic<00:04:13.030> it's<00:04:13.329> kind<00:04:13.569> of<00:04:13.629> lonely<00:04:13.810> but<00:04:14.109> don't

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
traffic it's kind of lonely but don't

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.809 
traffic it's kind of lonely but don't
you<00:04:14.409> worry<00:04:14.560> cuz<00:04:14.859> there<00:04:15.040> are<00:04:15.069> definitely<00:04:15.700> other

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
you worry cuz there are definitely other

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.550 
you worry cuz there are definitely other
cars<00:04:16.269> on<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.570> street<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.139> you<00:04:17.259> hit<00:04:17.380> three

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
cars on the street and if you hit three

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.289 
cars on the street and if you hit three
of<00:04:17.739> them<00:04:17.859> then<00:04:18.039> traffic<00:04:18.400> lady<00:04:18.579> comes<00:04:18.849> back<00:04:19.090> and

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
of them then traffic lady comes back and

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.150 
of them then traffic lady comes back and
kicks<00:04:19.509> you<00:04:19.630> out<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> game<00:04:20.259> they're<00:04:20.620> really

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
kicks you out of the game they're really

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.800 
kicks you out of the game they're really
sparse<00:04:21.519> though<00:04:21.759> so<00:04:22.060> it's<00:04:22.270> pretty<00:04:22.449> easy<00:04:22.570> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
sparse though so it's pretty easy to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.659 
sparse though so it's pretty easy to
avoid<00:04:23.169> them<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.620> they<00:04:24.009> don't<00:04:24.220> seem<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.550> be

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
avoid them and they don't seem to be

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.290 
avoid them and they don't seem to be
moving<00:04:24.849> all<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.300> fast<00:04:26.039> actually<00:04:27.039> I<00:04:27.300> don't

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
moving all that fast actually I don't
