I just heard of waxing and I noticed

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.080 
I just heard of waxing and I noticed
that<00:05:34.380> my<00:05:34.470> armpits<00:05:34.889> were<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.039> lot<00:05:35.460> lighter<00:05:35.729> like

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
that my armpits were a lot lighter like

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.060 
that my armpits were a lot lighter like
I<00:05:36.330> could<00:05:36.570> just<00:05:36.720> they<00:05:37.199> were<00:05:37.289> just<00:05:37.590> like<00:05:37.860> okay

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
I could just they were just like okay

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.100 
I could just they were just like okay
like<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:38.880> even<00:05:39.330> when<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.659> hair<00:05:39.870> grows<00:05:40.080> back

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
like and even when the hair grows back

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.200 
like and even when the hair grows back
it<00:05:40.500> still<00:05:40.710> looks<00:05:40.919> like<00:05:41.099> because<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.970> hairs

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
it still looks like because the hairs

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.290 
it still looks like because the hairs
are<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.720> thin<00:05:43.349> you<00:05:44.159> can<00:05:44.370> barely<00:05:44.729> even<00:05:44.820> see<00:05:45.120> them

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
are so thin you can barely even see them

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.350 
are so thin you can barely even see them
so<00:05:45.599> my<00:05:46.080> hair<00:05:46.260> can<00:05:46.440> be<00:05:46.560> like<00:05:46.740> hella<00:05:46.979> hairy<00:05:47.360> right

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
won't see a thing so I really recommend

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.409 
won't see a thing so I really recommend
waxing<00:05:53.190> because<00:05:53.250> it<00:05:53.460> takes<00:05:53.639> it<00:05:53.789> right<00:05:54.150> from

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
waxing because it takes it right from

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.290 
waxing because it takes it right from
the<00:05:54.570> root<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:55.139> then<00:05:55.889> I'll<00:05:56.340> definitely

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
the root and then I'll definitely

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.740 
the root and then I'll definitely
exfoliate<00:05:57.960> under<00:05:58.139> there<00:05:58.320> so<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:58.560> don't

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
exfoliate under there so you don't

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.830 
exfoliate under there so you don't
like<00:05:59.430> ingrown<00:06:00.430> hairs<00:06:00.790> and<00:06:01.060> all<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.360> so<00:06:01.660> on<00:06:01.810> a
