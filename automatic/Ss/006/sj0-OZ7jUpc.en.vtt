okay hi and today I'll be showing you
how<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.950> make<00:00:05.359> rubberband<00:00:06.359> gun<00:00:06.390> out<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.140> Lego

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
how to make rubberband gun out of Lego

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.680 
how to make rubberband gun out of Lego
this<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.580> probably<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.269> simplest

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
this is probably one of the simplest

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.880 
this is probably one of the simplest
designs<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.380> know<00:00:11.300> and<00:00:13.400> it's<00:00:14.839> pretty<00:00:15.839> easy<00:00:15.900> okay

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
designs I know and it's pretty easy okay

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050 
designs I know and it's pretty easy okay
start<00:00:17.850> off<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.029> getting<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.529> black<00:00:19.980> piece<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
start off by getting a black piece or it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
start off by getting a black piece or it
doesn't<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.779> black<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.220> piece

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
doesn't have to be black just a piece

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.820 
doesn't have to be black just a piece
that's<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:26.609> length<00:00:27.920> piece<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:30.830> nine

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that's about this length piece it's nine

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.810 
that's about this length piece it's nine
across<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.630> one's<00:00:33.870> nine<00:00:34.820> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
across it I think this one's nine this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.290 
across it I think this one's nine this
one's<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.510> my<00:00:36.870> -<00:00:37.160> it's<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> two<00:00:39.149> by

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
one's for my - it's this one is two by

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
one's for my - it's this one is two by
two<00:00:40.670> and<00:00:42.170> first<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.920> your<00:00:44.450> um<00:00:46.489> 9

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
two and first of all you get your um 9

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.049 
two and first of all you get your um 9
by<00:00:47.700> 2<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:49.079> other<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.879> clip

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
by 2 and your other one and you clip

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.889 
by 2 and your other one and you clip
them<00:00:51.210> together<00:00:51.420> by<00:00:51.840> 4<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> see<00:00:54.780> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
them together by 4 as you can see it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.160 
them together by 4 as you can see it's
for<00:00:56.000> it's<00:00:57.000> they're<00:00:57.149> clipped<00:00:58.430> so<00:01:00.050> once<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
for it's they're clipped so once you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
for it's they're clipped so once you
have<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.910> get<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.090> blue<00:01:03.359> piece<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have this you get your blue piece and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.410 
have this you get your blue piece and
you<00:01:04.500> stick<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> onto<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.240> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you stick it onto the side so it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.800 
you stick it onto the side so it's
sticking<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.950> say<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.810> I'm

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
sticking out on if say if I'm

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.340 
sticking out on if say if I'm
right-handed<00:01:10.700> I'm<00:01:11.700> right-handed<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.960> have

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
right-handed I'm right-handed so I have

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
right-handed I'm right-handed so I have
this<00:01:13.500> sticking<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> left<00:01:14.520> side<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this sticking out on the left side so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
this sticking out on the left side so
that's<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> rubberband<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.710> hook<00:01:16.860> on

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that's what the rubberband can hook on

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's what the rubberband can hook on
to<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> last<00:01:21.030> piece<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> this

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
to so and then the last piece is this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
to so and then the last piece is this
black<00:01:22.020> piece<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.979> goes<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> back

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
black piece and it just goes on the back

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.780 
black piece and it just goes on the back
for<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> group<00:01:25.250> just<00:01:26.250> helps<00:01:26.670> hold<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:29.369> for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
for a group just helps hold it now for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.160 
for a group just helps hold it now for
the<00:01:30.030> loading<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.400> shooting<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:33.630> blue<00:01:33.930> piece

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the loading and shooting that blue piece

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
the loading and shooting that blue piece
that<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> put<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.460> hook<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> around<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that you put on just hook it around the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.789 
that you put on just hook it around the
edge<00:01:37.189> like<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> bring<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> all

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
edge like so and then you bring it all

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
edge like so and then you bring it all
the<00:01:40.829> way<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.360> and<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.420> put<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> right<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the way up and just put it right on the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
the way up and just put it right on the
corner<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> top<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:47.149> right

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
corner on the top so it's just right

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.770 
corner on the top so it's just right
there

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.910 

and<00:01:55.590> then<00:01:55.830> for<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> firing<00:02:00.260> I'll<00:02:01.260> show<00:02:01.860> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and then for the firing I'll show you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.760 
and then for the firing I'll show you
down<00:02:02.220> here<00:02:02.780> firing<00:02:04.670> I'll<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.240> firing<00:02:07.759> at<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
down here firing I'll be firing at that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.980 
down here firing I'll be firing at that
piece<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> wood<00:02:11.070> down<00:02:11.100> there<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.780> good

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
piece of wood down there it's a good

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.820 
piece of wood down there it's a good
angle<00:02:13.230> where<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.890> see<00:02:14.070> me<00:02:14.190> shoot<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.830> I'll

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
angle where you can see me shoot so I'll

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.500 
angle where you can see me shoot so I'll
be<00:02:16.950> firing<00:02:17.190> at<00:02:17.459> three<00:02:17.700> two<00:02:18.510> one

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
be firing at three two one
