00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
you can see first off let's just go in

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.470 
you can see first off let's just go in
here<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.600> bluetooth<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.890> see<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.609> to

here to bluetooth you can see here to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.259 
here to bluetooth you can see here to
power<00:00:27.750> an<00:00:27.960> Apple<00:00:28.349> watch<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.340> iphone<00:00:29.939> go

they're going to have like an Apple
watch<00:00:33.090> app<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.710> then<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:35.309> kind<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> cool

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
watch app and then that's kind of cool

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
watch app and then that's kind of cool
that<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.270> inside<00:00:36.750> their<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> Bluetooth

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that that's inside their of Bluetooth

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
that that's inside their of Bluetooth
when<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.570> software<00:00:39.989> update<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
when you can see here software update I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.240 
when you can see here software update I
was<00:00:40.590> eight<00:00:40.770> pointer<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:43.100> version<00:00:44.100> here

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
was eight pointer and it is version here

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.680 
was eight pointer and it is version here
c<00:00:47.250> 12<00:00:47.969> d<00:00:48.980> 546<00:00:49.980> 1<00:00:50.250> b<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> something<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.660> can

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
c 12 d 546 1 b of something and you can

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.770 
c 12 d 546 1 b of something and you can
also<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.550> storage<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> i

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
also see the storage here kind of i

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.189 
also see the storage here kind of i
don't<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.289> i<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.649> much<00:00:56.840> much<00:00:57.840> stuff

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
don't think i have that much much stuff

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
don't think i have that much much stuff
the<00:00:58.440> adapter<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.100> around<00:00:59.280> 270<00:01:00.030> megabytes

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the adapter it was around 270 megabytes

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.510 
the adapter it was around 270 megabytes
so<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.050> probably<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.620> come<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.160> some<00:01:02.370> bug

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
so it probably would come with some bug

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.969 
so it probably would come with some bug
fixes<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.969> stuff<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.920> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
fixes and stuff like that but you know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
fixes and stuff like that but you know
that<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> was<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.970> something<00:01:06.240> specifically

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that it was not something specifically

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
that it was not something specifically
that<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.860> did<00:01:08.130> list<00:01:09.560> but<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:11.159> could<00:01:11.340> still<00:01:11.369> be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that they did list but it could still be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
that they did list but it could still be
a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.420> fun<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.140> check<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
a little bit fun there to check out the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.050 
a little bit fun there to check out the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
did a video here on the galaxy j 1 which

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.080 
did a video here on the galaxy j 1 which
is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.270> pretty<00:01:22.140> cool<00:01:22.560> new<00:01:23.540> device<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:25.880> low<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is a pretty cool new device here low and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
is a pretty cool new device here low and
64-bit<00:01:27.990> quad<00:01:28.950> core<00:01:29.189> processor<00:01:30.290> will<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.560> can

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
64-bit quad core processor will so i can

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:47.920 
64-bit quad core processor will so i can
zoom<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:33.170> well<00:01:34.170> no<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> can't

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.140 

this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.710> still<00:01:49.220> also<00:01:49.580> kind<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:49.970> weird

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
this is still also kind of weird

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180 
this is still also kind of weird
sometimes<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.350> see<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.560> sometimes<00:01:52.010> I

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
sometimes you can see it sometimes I

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.610 
sometimes you can see it sometimes I
have<00:01:52.430> some<00:01:52.820> apps<00:01:53.060> in<00:01:53.270> multitasking<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:54.260> it

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
have some apps in multitasking and it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.590 
have some apps in multitasking and it
doesn't<00:01:54.980> show<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.220> thumbnail<00:01:55.850> that's<00:01:56.390> it

doesn't show the thumbnail that's it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.530 
doesn't show the thumbnail that's it
that's<00:01:56.780> like<00:01:56.930> annoying<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:57.800> think<00:01:58.460> we<00:01:59.420> also

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
that's like annoying I think we also

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.290 
that's like annoying I think we also
have<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.810> rumors<00:02:00.170> here<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.850> they<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:02.030> going

iOS more for the public at the moment I

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.690 
iOS more for the public at the moment I
was<00:02:08.869> eight<00:02:09.110> point<00:02:09.500> one<00:02:09.560> point<00:02:09.709> three<00:02:10.009> i<00:02:10.310> think

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
was eight point one point three i think

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.600 
was eight point one point three i think
it<00:02:10.820> was<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.290> hopefully<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.010> could<00:02:13.190> come<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
it was so hopefully that could come this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.810 
it was so hopefully that could come this
week<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:14.060> well<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.510> i<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.470> take<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:16.550> bit
