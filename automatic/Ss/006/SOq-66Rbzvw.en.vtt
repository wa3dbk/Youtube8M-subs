remember<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.960> there's<00:01:27.960> definitely

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
remember because there's definitely

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
remember because there's definitely
gonna<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.650> more<00:01:28.860> website<00:01:29.340> forget<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
gonna be more website forget about and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.280 
gonna be more website forget about and
they're<00:01:30.390> probably<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.079> favorite

but<00:01:31.590> we'll<00:01:31.920> start<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.549> cut<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.720> um<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.829> would

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
but we'll start it so cut for um i would

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.670 
but we'll start it so cut for um i would
probably<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.119> strike<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> good<00:01:37.530> map

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
probably say strike I was a good map

quitting<00:03:04.620> I've<00:03:04.920> thought<00:03:05.220> about<00:03:05.280> being<00:03:05.670> less

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
quitting I've thought about being less

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.390 
quitting I've thought about being less
active<00:03:06.450> just<00:03:07.320> because<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.770> how<00:03:07.920> much<00:03:08.130> time

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
active just because of how much time

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.500 
active just because of how much time
this<00:03:08.580> takes<00:03:08.850> up<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.330> me<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.630> now<00:03:10.490> but<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.820> I

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
this takes up for me right now but I I

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.730 
this takes up for me right now but I I
just<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.020> thing<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.440> back<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.710> my

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
just have this thing in the back of my

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.230 
just have this thing in the back of my
mind<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.130> say<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> know<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:14.700> ghost<00:03:14.970> isn't

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
mind just say you know if ghost isn't

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.910 
mind just say you know if ghost isn't
that<00:03:15.480> good<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.960> I<00:03:16.020> don't<00:03:16.200> enjoy<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.680> much

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
that good and I don't enjoy that much

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.940 
that good and I don't enjoy that much
that<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.700> become<00:03:18.150> less<00:03:19.140> active<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.710> little

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
that I will become less active a little

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.300 
that I will become less active a little
bit<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.910> become<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.810> more<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.740> montage<00:03:23.070> guy

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
bit just become a more of a montage guy

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.950 
bit just become a more of a montage guy
again<00:03:23.580> rather<00:03:23.850> than<00:03:24.000> making<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.690> lot<00:03:24.840> more

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
again rather than making a lot more

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.930 
again rather than making a lot more
colleges<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.500> try<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.860> active<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.520> think

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
colleges to try and be active I think

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.640 
colleges to try and be active I think
that's<00:03:27.120> probably<00:03:27.270> what<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> need<00:03:27.900> if<00:03:28.170> ghost

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that's probably what I need if ghost

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.560 
that's probably what I need if ghost
isn't<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.070> good<00:03:29.280> plus<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.000> allows<00:03:30.060> me<00:03:30.270> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
isn't that good plus it allows me to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.170 
isn't that good plus it allows me to
focus<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:31.170> lot<00:03:31.380> more<00:03:31.620> on<00:03:31.830> my<00:03:31.860> education<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.970> yeah

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
focus a lot more on my education so yeah

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.550 
focus a lot more on my education so yeah
hope<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.870> haven't<00:03:34.080> really<00:03:34.290> thought<00:03:34.380> about

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
hope I haven't really thought about

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.260 
hope I haven't really thought about
quitting<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.760> know<00:03:35.880> Eiffel<00:03:36.150> thought

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
quitting but you know Eiffel thought

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.510 
quitting but you know Eiffel thought
about<00:03:36.510> being<00:03:36.690> less<00:03:36.900> active<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.710> that's<00:03:37.950> not

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
about being less active and that's not

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.340 
about being less active and that's not
obviously<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> same<00:03:39.420> thing<00:03:39.450> but<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.080> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
obviously not the same thing but it's a

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.770 
know three years of my life so I thought
I<00:06:14.340> need<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.610> focus<00:06:14.790> on<00:06:15.030> that<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.210> make<00:06:15.600> it<00:06:15.630> a

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
I need to focus on that and make it a

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.800 
I need to focus on that and make it a
montage<00:06:16.140> you<00:06:16.350> always<00:06:16.710> have<00:06:16.919> that<00:06:17.810> just

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
montage you always have that just

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.510 
montage you always have that just
something<00:06:19.140> in<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.440> backe<00:06:19.620> mind<00:06:19.950> thinking<00:06:20.340> you

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
something in the backe mind thinking you

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.700 
something in the backe mind thinking you
know<00:06:20.640> you<00:06:20.790> need<00:06:20.970> to<00:06:21.060> go<00:06:21.210> home<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.630> edit<00:06:22.560> this

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
know you need to go home and edit this

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.020 
know you need to go home and edit this
so<00:06:22.770> you<00:06:23.010> need<00:06:23.160> to<00:06:23.280> get<00:06:23.430> these<00:06:23.580> clips<00:06:23.880> or

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
so you need to get these clips or

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
so you need to get these clips or
something<00:06:24.270> like<00:06:24.360> that<00:06:24.419> he's<00:06:24.660> always

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
something like that he's always

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.960 
something like that he's always
something<00:06:25.350> on<00:06:25.470> your<00:06:25.590> mind<00:06:25.620> trying<00:06:26.070> to<00:06:26.190> think

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
something on your mind trying to think

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.520 
something on your mind trying to think
about<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.300> montage<00:06:27.660> you<00:06:27.870> just<00:06:28.169> don't<00:06:28.350> water

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
about the montage you just don't water

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.650 
about the montage you just don't water
this<00:06:28.950> stage<00:06:29.250> why<00:06:29.520> I<00:06:29.550> don't<00:06:29.850> want<00:06:30.000> to<00:06:30.060> say<00:06:30.419> so<00:06:30.480> I

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
this stage why I don't want to say so I

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.330 
this stage why I don't want to say so I
thought<00:06:30.750> last<00:06:31.230> montage<00:06:31.680> let's<00:06:31.980> make<00:06:32.130> it<00:06:32.160> on

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
thought last montage let's make it on

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.040 
thought last montage let's make it on
black<00:06:33.030> ops<00:06:33.150> 2<00:06:33.330> let's<00:06:33.540> try<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:33.780> make<00:06:33.840> it<00:06:33.900> the

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
black ops 2 let's try and make it the

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.480 
black ops 2 let's try and make it the
best<00:06:34.200> I<00:06:34.350> can

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
best I can

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.219 
best I can
I<00:06:35.550> thought<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.240> thought<00:06:36.330> I<00:06:36.720> don't<00:06:36.900> really<00:06:37.020> want

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
I thought I thought I don't really want

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.439 
I thought I thought I don't really want
to<00:06:37.289> name<00:06:37.470> it<00:06:37.500> something<00:06:37.740> else<00:06:38.009> and<00:06:38.340> is<00:06:39.060> a<00:06:39.090> black

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
to name it something else and is a black

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.330 
to name it something else and is a black
up<00:06:39.569> series<00:06:40.020> so<00:06:40.259> it<00:06:40.380> kind<00:06:40.590> of<00:06:40.710> just<00:06:40.860> work<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:41.310> I

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
up series so it kind of just work so I

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.710 
up series so it kind of just work so I
thought<00:06:41.520> why<00:06:41.729> not<00:06:41.759> call<00:06:42.060> it<00:06:42.180> example<00:06:42.539> for

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
thought why not call it example for

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.930 
thought why not call it example for
let's<00:06:42.930> just<00:06:43.110> do<00:06:43.259> it<00:06:43.289> and<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:43.590> was<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.849> was

let's just do it and that was that was
pretty<00:06:45.120> much<00:06:45.270> for<00:06:45.449> plan<00:06:45.660> so<00:06:45.840> that's<00:06:45.990> why<00:06:46.110> I

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139
