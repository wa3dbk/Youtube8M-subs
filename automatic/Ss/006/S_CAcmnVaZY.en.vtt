00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.000 

this<00:00:11.510> kite<00:00:11.690> was<00:00:11.840> designed<00:00:12.350> to<00:00:12.470> have<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:12.680> lot<00:00:12.980> of

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
this kite was designed to have a lot of

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.339 
this kite was designed to have a lot of
power<00:00:13.250> and<00:00:13.640> give<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:13.880> lot<00:00:14.120> of<00:00:14.150> range<00:00:14.450> because<00:00:15.200> of

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
power and give a lot of range because of

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.689 
power and give a lot of range because of
that<00:00:15.470> who<00:00:15.769> doesn't<00:00:16.010> want<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.160> fly<00:00:16.279> up<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.490> the

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
that who doesn't want to fly up to the

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.580 
that who doesn't want to fly up to the
edge<00:00:16.820> of<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.060> windows<00:00:17.330> -<00:00:17.720> so<00:00:18.019> when<00:00:18.170> I<00:00:18.199> design

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
edge of the windows - so when I design

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.830 
edge of the windows - so when I design
the<00:00:18.920> bridle<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.460> made<00:00:19.940> a<00:00:19.970> bridle<00:00:20.390> that<00:00:20.449> actually

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
the bridle I made a bridle that actually

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.660 
the bridle I made a bridle that actually
wants<00:00:21.110> to<00:00:21.170> fly<00:00:21.470> further<00:00:22.070> out<00:00:22.310> on<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.580> edge<00:00:22.640> of

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
wants to fly further out on the edge of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.760 
wants to fly further out on the edge of
the<00:00:22.880> window<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:23.539> by<00:00:23.690> having<00:00:23.840> the<00:00:24.110> combination

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
the window so by having the combination

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.040 
the window so by having the combination
of<00:00:24.860> a<00:00:24.980> caisson<00:00:25.190> wants<00:00:25.609> to<00:00:25.730> sit<00:00:25.940> back<00:00:26.119> yet<00:00:26.840> with

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050

of a caisson wants to sit back yet with
the<00:00:27.140> bridle<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.590> wants<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:27.920> take<00:00:28.190> it

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
the bridle that wants to take it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.400 
the bridle that wants to take it
forwards<00:00:28.789> have<00:00:29.449> a<00:00:29.510> kite<00:00:29.779> that<00:00:29.930> actually<00:00:30.260> gives

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
forwards have a kite that actually gives

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.960 
forwards have a kite that actually gives
you<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.560> best<00:00:30.830> of<00:00:31.010> both<00:00:31.130> worlds<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.699> gives<00:00:31.850> you

well<00:01:48.950> originally<00:01:49.190> we<00:01:49.460> designed<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.060> prodigy

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
well originally we designed the prodigy

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.600 
well originally we designed the prodigy
has<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.840> as<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:51.320> school<00:01:51.680> kite<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:52.040> as<00:01:52.460> an

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
has a as a school kite as as an

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.870 
has a as a school kite as as an
entry-level<00:01:52.910> kite<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.690> so<00:01:53.930> we<00:01:54.620> made<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.730> kite

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
entry-level kite and so we made the kite

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.730 
entry-level kite and so we made the kite
that<00:01:56.000> had<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.300> be<00:01:56.420> stable<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.290> had<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.530> be<00:01:57.620> easy

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
that had to be stable it had to be easy

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.090 
that had to be stable it had to be easy
to<00:01:57.980> relaunch<00:01:58.310> had<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.730> have<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> wide<00:01:59.150> range<00:01:59.480> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
to relaunch had to have a wide range and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.650 
to relaunch had to have a wide range and
