rio and Harry to be honest and I think

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.910

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
experience there in Richard Rio and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.770 
experience there in Richard Rio and
Clinton<00:00:45.829> he's<00:00:46.829> 35<00:00:47.399> years<00:00:47.700> old<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.149> what's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
Clinton he's 35 years old but what's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
Clinton he's 35 years old but what's
important<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> balance<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
important here is the balance of this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
important here is the balance of this
squad<00:00:50.730> yeah<00:00:51.570> very<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.289> think<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
squad yeah very much so and I think that

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.139 
squad yeah very much so and I think that
I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:53.219> fan<00:00:53.430> shouldn't<00:00:53.730> get<00:00:53.789> too<00:00:53.850> carried

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I think fan shouldn't get too carried

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.720 
I think fan shouldn't get too carried
away<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.699> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
away with you know it's not about one of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
away with you know it's not about one of
the<00:00:56.850> others<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.780> we'd<00:00:58.050> gone<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.469> nine

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the others if we'd gone with nine

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.420 
the others if we'd gone with nine
signings<00:00:59.609> over<00:00:59.760> 35<00:01:00.270> role<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.719> you'd<00:01:01.530> say<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
signings over 35 role then you'd say you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
signings over 35 role then you'd say you
know<00:01:02.550> boy<00:01:03.059> what's<00:01:03.899> attorney<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> team

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.730 
know boy what's attorney in and the team
doing<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.950> 920<00:01:07.950> arose<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:09.740> think

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
doing if we go with 920 arose I think

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.980 
doing if we go with 920 arose I think
people<00:01:10.890> would<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.189> say<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
people would also say you know are you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.850 
people would also say you know are you
nuts<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> balance<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:15.740> we've<00:01:16.740> got

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
nuts so there's a balance and we've got

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.109 
nuts so there's a balance and we've got

turns out but gotta say I'm in a much
better<00:02:03.770> feeling<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.100> doing<00:02:05.280> we're

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
better feeling what we're doing we're

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.410 
better feeling what we're doing we're
talking<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.640> four<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:05.939> five<00:02:06.030> players

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
talking about four or five players

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.610 
talking about four or five players
really<00:02:06.659> they'll<00:02:06.869> come<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
really they'll come in and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.640 
really they'll come in and
hopefully<00:02:08.630> strengthen<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:10.110> very<00:02:10.320> good<00:02:10.470> squad

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
hopefully strengthen the very good squad

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.710 
hopefully strengthen the very good squad
we<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.890> already<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.970> does<00:02:12.210> seem<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.630> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
we have already it does seem to be a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.570 
we have already it does seem to be a
very<00:02:12.780> different<00:02:13.260> approach<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
very different approach in that the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
very different approach in that the
squad<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.120> place<00:02:15.360> let's<00:02:15.690> add<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.110> rather

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
squad is in place let's add to it rather

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.130 
squad is in place let's add to it rather
than<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:17.190> build<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.700> squat<00:02:17.940> yeah<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.990> know

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the season is about stability it's about

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.840

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
squad together and added to it so that's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.000 
squad together and added to it so that's
what<00:02:38.820> we<00:02:38.910> try<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.450> year<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.770> seem

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
what we try to do this year you do seem

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.490 
what we try to do this year you do seem
very<00:02:41.430> relaxed<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.510> transfer<00:02:42.960> window<00:02:42.990> has

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
very relaxed in this transfer window has

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.400 
very relaxed in this transfer window has
that<00:02:43.680> come<00:02:44.070> from<00:02:44.190> experience<00:02:44.820> yeah<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.570> has<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
that come from experience yeah it has it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.600 
that come from experience yeah it has it
has<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:48.260> think<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.320> messages<00:02:49.830> we're<00:02:50.520> not

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
has and I think the messages we're not

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.520 
has and I think the messages we're not
going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.790> wait<00:02:50.910> for<00:02:50.940> any<00:02:51.210> player<00:02:51.470> there<00:02:52.470> are

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
does seem the most important ingredient

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.050 
does seem the most important ingredient
is<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> player<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> wants<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.130> play<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:11.370> QPR
