 further after that there will be a screensaver therefore 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.649
 plus the next 10 seconds you have a shorter 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.649
 everything starting 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.630
 first thing i want to tell you 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.550
 This is what I dyed my hair but not that 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.200
 to be colored them brightened and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.330
 this is not done on the whole head 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.940
 starting from about here you probably don't 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 notice the difference special can and only 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.240
 experienced if a teen girl or but if i 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.240
 will do so 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.830
 it feels like both of you 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.290
 gold plated is really cool 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.950
 Generally not and yellow hair not red they 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.710
 just not 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.590
 golden and many asked me Masha 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.950
 something my head why are you so hair 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.680
 shine really secret is a simple pit 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.870
 different shampoos and my hair 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.090
 normal but scalp especially 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.950
 lately it has become very gentle 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 sensitive I don't know what to do 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.910
 so follow me some 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.130
 balm or mask that will lead him 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.830
 skin is a normal condition because 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.470
 In general, I have a straight skin 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.320
 As for shampoos, I already said that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.420
 shampoo and different for him are different brands 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.400
 for different types of each individual 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.200
 shampoo each has different hair 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.670
 hair and scalp structure 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.230
 therefore, in general, we inflate advise 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.210
 nothing can therefore quarrel 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.610
 By the way, can you notice that in the back 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.380
 plan are my two bro this is mikhail and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.480
 Bunny dangerous Gadget and today they are well 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.700
 just stand behind the hashtag I as always 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.220
 all so that's about the shampoo and I have nothing 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.370
 I can advise but my hairdresser gave 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.420
 I try these 2 shampoos and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.850

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.580
 it was still advised me oil for 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.700
 I heard his hair I saw somewhere 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.920
 other bloggers fund shorter damn I'm not 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.310

 if at all priest rarely for cosmetics 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.110
