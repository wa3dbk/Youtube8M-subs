when I need to brew I wear virtus and I
and<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.289> blue<00:02:10.530> because<00:02:11.009> instead<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.120> hundred

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and I blue because instead of a hundred

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.780 
and I blue because instead of a hundred
and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and

that's only 14 special movement points
for<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.189> hill<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.120> combine<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.049> with<00:02:41.129> virtus

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
for a hill and combine that with virtus

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.490 
for a hill and combine that with virtus
that's<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.359> nice<00:02:43.540> combination<00:02:43.870> order

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
that's really a nice combination order

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.250 
that's really a nice combination order
to<00:02:44.680> stop<00:02:44.920> bottom<00:02:45.370> spirit<00:02:46.060> game<00:02:46.299> then<00:02:47.019> heal

to stop bottom spirit game then heal

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.949 
to stop bottom spirit game then heal
myself<00:02:47.549> then<00:02:48.549> switch<00:02:48.939> back<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.599> range

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
myself then switch back to the range

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.140 
myself then switch back to the range
gear<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.829> continue<00:02:51.340> killing<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.879> you've
