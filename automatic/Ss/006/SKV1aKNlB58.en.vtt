00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
and going into a couple things I like to

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.380 
and going into a couple things I like to
put<00:00:59.019> them<00:00:59.140> close<00:00:59.710> but<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.400> always<00:01:00.670> try<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.150> put

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
put them close but I always try to put

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.530 
put them close but I always try to put
my<00:01:01.510> decoys<00:01:01.960> at<00:01:02.470> between<00:01:02.830> 12<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.400> 15<00:01:03.940> yards<00:01:04.180> I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
my decoys at between 12 to 15 yards I

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.349 
my decoys at between 12 to 15 yards I
feel<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.790> distance<00:01:07.780> from<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.350> blind

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
feel that that distance from the blind

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.249 
feel that that distance from the blind
allows<00:01:10.469> the<00:01:11.469> hunter<00:01:11.859> to<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.990> great<00:01:13.990> shot

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
allows the hunter to have a great shot

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.469 
allows the hunter to have a great shot
even<00:01:14.530> if<00:01:14.649> that<00:01:14.740> bird<00:01:14.950> hangs<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.520> at<00:01:15.789> 30<00:01:16.090> yards

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
even if that bird hangs up at 30 yards

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.240 
even if that bird hangs up at 30 yards
he's<00:01:16.930> still<00:01:17.259> within<00:01:17.439> range<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.130> can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
he's still within range and you can

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.069 
he's still within range and you can
still<00:01:18.490> pull<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.180> trigger<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.630> drop<00:01:19.869> them

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
still pull the trigger and drop them

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.039 
still pull the trigger and drop them
effectively<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.619> going<00:01:23.859> on<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:25.049> I'll

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.110 
I'll take my decoy steak and all
electrical<00:02:10.720> tape<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.650> joint<00:02:11.680> where<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.880> pops

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
electrical tape the joint where it pops

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.110 
electrical tape the joint where it pops
together<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:14.230> at<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.470> top<00:02:14.769> I'll<00:02:15.159> wrap

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
together and then at the top I'll wrap

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.410 
together and then at the top I'll wrap
it<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.280> last<00:02:18.730> loop

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it and then on that last loop

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.930 
it and then on that last loop
of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:20.470> electrical<00:02:20.950> tape<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.280> flipping<00:02:21.819> around

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
of the electrical tape I flipping around

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.780 
of the electrical tape I flipping around
to<00:02:22.300> where<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.599> sticky<00:02:22.900> sides<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:24.580> this

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
to where the sticky sides out what this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.070 
to where the sticky sides out what this
does<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.450> when<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:26.530> put<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.489> into<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.180> decoy<00:02:28.569> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
does is when I put it into the decoy it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.540 
does is when I put it into the decoy it
sticks<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.550> when<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:31.420> sitting<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.840> it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
sticks so when it's sitting there it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.010 
sticks so when it's sitting there it
won't<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.940> won't<00:02:34.150> move<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> when<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.220> get<00:02:36.459> that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
won't it won't move so when you get that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.840 
won't it won't move so when you get that
big<00:02:38.020> gust<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.500> went<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.950> D<00:02:39.190> coil<00:02:39.459> move<00:02:39.730> a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
big gust of went the D coil move a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.340 
big gust of went the D coil move a
little<00:02:40.120> bit<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.660> not<00:02:40.720> going<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.050> spin

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
little bit but it's not going to spin

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.880 
little bit but it's not going to spin
around<00:02:41.380> which<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.819> allow<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.739> your

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
around which will allow you to for your

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.830 
around which will allow you to for your
bird<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.310> you're<00:02:45.459> calling<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.269> see<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
bird that you're calling in to see that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.660 
bird that you're calling in to see that
the<00:02:46.930> decoy<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.470> moving<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.400> it's<00:02:48.550> not

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
the decoy is moving but it's not

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.660 
the decoy is moving but it's not
spinning<00:02:48.880> around<00:02:49.260> here<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.410> come<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:51.040> they

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
spinning around here they come and they

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.430 
spinning around here they come and they
that<00:02:51.970> might<00:02:52.209> be<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> different<00:02:52.989> difference

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
that might be the different difference

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.910 
that might be the different difference
from<00:02:53.590> your<00:02:53.709> bird<00:02:53.950> being<00:02:54.280> at<00:02:55.350> 50<00:02:56.350> yards<00:02:56.500> 30

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
from your bird being at 50 yards 30

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.150 
from your bird being at 50 yards 30
yards<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:57.549> 15<00:02:58.000> yards<00:02:58.420> pull<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> trigger<00:02:59.739> you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
yards then 15 yards pull the trigger you

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.910 
yards then 15 yards pull the trigger you
harvested<00:03:00.580> your<00:03:00.760> bird
