dirt and stuff from the stud part of the
stabilizer<00:01:58.329> links<00:01:58.689> just<00:01:59.470> helps<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.460> then

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
stabilizer links just helps and then

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.580 
stabilizer links just helps and then
you'll<00:02:01.630> probably<00:02:01.750> wanna<00:02:02.020> spray<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.380> down<00:02:02.530> with

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
you'll probably wanna spray it down with

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.719 
you'll probably wanna spray it down with
some<00:02:02.770> penetrating<00:02:03.310> oil<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:05.740> are<00:02:06.039> 17

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
some penetrating oil these are 17

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.199 
some penetrating oil these are 17
millimeter<00:02:07.210> bolts<00:02:07.570> on<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.840> originals<00:02:08.369> or<00:02:09.369> I'm

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
millimeter bolts on the originals or I'm

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.759 
millimeter bolts on the originals or I'm
sorry<00:02:10.420> there's<00:02:10.660> 17<00:02:10.989> millimeter<00:02:11.349> nuts

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
sorry there's 17 millimeter nuts

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.920 
sorry there's 17 millimeter nuts
so<00:02:12.310> put<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.519> 17<00:02:12.910> millimeter<00:02:13.269> socket<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.720> there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
so put a 17 millimeter socket on there

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
so put a 17 millimeter socket on there
make<00:02:14.800> sure<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.069> goes<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.430> well<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:18.010> I'm

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
make sure it goes on well and then I'm

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.520 
make sure it goes on well and then I'm
going<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.880> use<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.269> ratchet<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:20.319> going<00:02:20.470> to

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
going to use a ratchet and I'm going to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.170 
going to use a ratchet and I'm going to
use<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.650> piece<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.950> pipe<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.430> well<00:02:21.610> give<00:02:21.940> me<00:02:22.030> some

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
use a piece of pipe as well give me some

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:37.770 
use a piece of pipe as well give me some
extra<00:02:22.390> leverage<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:24.549> loosen<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.830> nut<00:02:36.780> now

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
extra leverage to loosen up the nut now

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
extra leverage to loosen up the nut now
I'll<00:02:37.930> put<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> 19<00:02:38.500> millimeter<00:02:38.650> wrench<00:02:39.220> on<00:02:39.549> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I'll put a 19 millimeter wrench on the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.750 
I'll put a 19 millimeter wrench on the
backside<00:02:40.780> there's<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.380> nut<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.579> hold

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
backside there's a nut that you can hold

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.970 
backside there's a nut that you can hold
on<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.480> can<00:02:43.599> see<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:44.620> wrenches

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
on to and you can see that wrenches

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.370 
on to and you can see that wrenches
going<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.190> start<00:02:45.370> moving<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.480> I'll<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.230> up

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
going to start moving so I'll get it up

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.630 
going to start moving so I'll get it up
and<00:02:47.680> get<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:49.290> strut<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> hold<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.769> for<00:02:51.340> me<00:02:51.489> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
and get the strut to hold it for me and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.000 
and get the strut to hold it for me and
then<00:02:52.180> loosen<00:02:52.630> up<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.959> nut<00:02:58.620> nuts<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.799> nylon

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
then loosen up that nut nuts have nylon

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
then loosen up that nut nuts have nylon
locks<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.640> them<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.940> they<00:03:01.060> tend<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.329> come<00:03:01.600> out<00:03:01.750> a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
locks on them so they tend to come out a

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.599 
locks on them so they tend to come out a
little<00:03:01.930> bit<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> locks<00:03:03.100> will

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
little bit and then the locks will

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.360 
little bit and then the locks will
engage<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.510> it'll<00:03:05.290> stop<00:03:05.560> turning<00:03:05.889> so<00:03:06.250> you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
engage and it'll stop turning so you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.180 
engage and it'll stop turning so you
actually<00:03:07.290> tighten<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.380> back<00:03:08.470> up<00:03:08.530> spray<00:03:09.100> it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
actually tighten it back up spray it

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.190 
actually tighten it back up spray it
down<00:03:09.310> with<00:03:09.370> some<00:03:09.549> penetrating<00:03:10.060> oil<00:03:10.239> and<00:03:10.569> after

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
down with some penetrating oil and after

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.449 
down with some penetrating oil and after
a<00:03:11.230> few<00:03:13.019> kind<00:03:14.019> of<00:03:14.109> rounds<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.650> doing<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.130> they

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
a few kind of rounds of doing that they

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.059 
a few kind of rounds of doing that they
usually<00:03:15.790> come<00:03:16.120> right<00:03:16.329> off<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:18.010> is

usually come right off and this is

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.559 
usually come right off and this is
usually<00:03:18.280> what<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.700> professionals<00:03:19.329> avoid

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
usually what the professionals avoid

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.110 
usually what the professionals avoid
