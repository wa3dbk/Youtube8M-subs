00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.750
 how about friends welcome to ch fitness 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.389
 mexico this time I bring you the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.020
 form one of the easiest ways to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.120
 cooking and the most delicious in this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.350
 occasion is I'm going to teach you how to prepare 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.570
 chicken in barbeque sauce and how to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.610
 preparing it is very simple is the most 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.329
 simple of all there is no easier way 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 that 's for sure there's no easier way 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.309
 and what we are going to occupy this is what 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 following 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.990
 first the chicken that on this occasion 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.690
 I bought a poultry shop if you like 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.660
 they can cut off the fats that are left 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.880
 around here how are you if this time 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.460
 I'm not going to cut them so that the video 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.430
 I will continue to use this barbecue sauce 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 and the water and what I'm going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.830
 to know is this is a cooking pot 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.830
 slow is electric has two speeds 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.119
 low and high are only the only two 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.220
 speeds at high speed it takes you 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:21.009
 four hours bake and in the speed 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:24.490
 low it takes six hours to cook well 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 only thing to do is take the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.180
 chicken 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.010
 a chicken 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 and put it in the pot 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.380
 and ready 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.770
 once we pour them the only thing that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.250
 you have to make it very simple to add the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 sauce 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.720
 and you have to leave it there so that I know 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.540
 just go emptying it will take 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 because I'm going to sew it in the speed 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.960
 high 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 It will take 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.550
 around 4 hours 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.460
 some indications that came with the 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.400
 pot once the tapas as is 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.330
 slow cooking is very low cooking 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.270
 the fire 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.830
 good heat what you do not want to do 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.440
 this is for no because the uncovering does not 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.350
 heat is lost and it takes a long time 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.180
 I'm going to recover that heat again 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.409
 that temperature 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.109
 well already stirred the breasts and I got him 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.140
 the sauce to the bottom and I stirred it 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.189
 Now the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.469
 determine what speed he wants 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.469
 choose which in this case will be 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.410
 Y 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.190
 cover it 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.230
 ready 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.270
 it's the only thing you have to do with a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.270
 speed plug and wait 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.600
 after 4 hours the chicken is already there 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.740
 check is already cooked the only thing there 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.740
 what to do is turn off 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.680
 and let it cool a bit but for 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.050
 video reasons I'm not going to get it like that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.810
 as is 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.200
 now I'm going to show you how it is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.200
 the chicken 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.450
 it cooks barbeque sauce and on its own 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.450
 of your own juice 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.549
 then the only thing they have to do is 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.120
 crumble it as you see there is no center 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.180
 pink because it's already cooked 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.879
 and the taste that I tell you about the flavor 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.599
 simmered for that reason already that of 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.599
 slow cooking 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.360
 and as for the extra calories from the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.550
 barbeque sauce there is not much of what 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.510
 worry because most stay here 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.410
 inside you decide if after 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.040
 this grabs 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.420
 and they empty the chicken a little more for 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.420
 to stay with more flavor 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.390
 but friends I hope this recipe will 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.620
 I liked it was very simple one more 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.360
 empty chicken empty larvik sauce and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.690
 leave it to fire good not fire but in 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.430
 the high speed four hours if what 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.380
 you put in the low speed it takes 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.650
 around six hours but it remains 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.070
 still a little better 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.870
 and after that you decide that 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.120
 they make it crumble and they can do 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.919
 sandwiches can make burritos can 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.979
 do what they want with it is chicken 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.380
 crumbled with an excellent good taste 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.960
 you decide if they do 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.300
 inform us we have a comment 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.300
 doubt and many thanks 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.240
 and you
