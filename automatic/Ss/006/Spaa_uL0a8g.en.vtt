00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.599
 so after the feeding part 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.639
 shoe accessories an element too 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.799
 important is the tachometer a little 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.110
 like in a car and for that there is 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.690
 tools called gps watch in 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.960
 the sport so explain to us what that 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.580
 serves as it serves also the sportsman 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.040
 so the gps watch is an element to my 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.030
 quite important sense especially when as 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.370
 most marathoners on 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.170
 train a little bit alone it can be a 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.760
 little bit a reference why because 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.590
 that we will know in instant the 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.770
 speed at which one runs and the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.420
 distance that one travels exactly so 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 there on this model there we swim in a gps 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.079
 have that works with tomtom 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.220
 so we have instantaneous speed to 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.050
 which current is in minutes and 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.520
 seconds to kilometer in kilometers 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.690
 hour so that's important to manage 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.079
 his race regardless of the level of the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 runner 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.230
 regardless of the current level was 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.700
 also the heart rate aspect so 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.980
 it's one with a belt that have the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.110
 place at the level of the plexus and who want 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.120
 give some data a little bit 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.440
 more to his heart especially for 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.550
 training to know where we are 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.720
 where is the training exactly 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.520
 for people who work with 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.830
 with the more it is important 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.060
 if not me what I think the most 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.890
 important is especially the speed to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.180
 which one will run because by 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 compared to its nav marathon we will 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 set a pace will be able to split 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.620
 work on this look here it is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.730
 people who know a little 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.050
 training and then how do 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.910
 prepare for a marathon and how are we going 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.710
 run the marathon is to stall 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 a speed and then to respect his 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.860
 board exactly for whom 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 wants to run around 3h 3:15 of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.550
 marathon that will run after a pace 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.080
 from 4-10 to 4 kilometers which 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.400
 represents roughly 14 8 km hour there 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.320
 will have the data directly on his 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.450
 shows he the only one will allow to speak 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.800
 too fast or too slow compared to his 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.510
 then often look what can do 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.100
 fear is the price we can call back 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.750
 there are a few products 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.850
 differences range we find gps to 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.930
 price low enough so if I really got 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.060
 we really have for everyone so 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 for the customer who does not want too much 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.290
 will invest who would simply like 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 a watch 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 for the longer cardiac which 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.010
 So there is really only 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.720
 cardiac data 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.160
 so here we are saved the world that is going 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.990
 to go from 80 to 100 euros 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.460
 on the other hand for the clan who is on a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770
 little more pleasure and who will want 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.090
 have gps data 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.860
 there we will be a hand on a watch 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.630
 which will go from 150 to 200 euros 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 the gps gives the guarantee to have a 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.220
 accuracy in the mileage and well 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 sure then there it is we really have 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.400
 data really accurate because if there is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.840
 purpose via satellite so that will be really 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.700
 to the nearest meter 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.870
 really the distance that the runner is going 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 browse that's why sometimes a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.370
 runner so a marathon that was 42 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.930
 km 195 x current is going to have a little bit 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 more or a little less 7 depending 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.040
 in a trajectory that will take but 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 on products like that we're on 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.459
 products at between 150 and 200 euros after 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.230
 on customers who want to make themselves 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.299
 little more fun we can climb up 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 400 500 euros but here we really have 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.260
 data - 2 different ones with a 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.170
 virtual training partner a 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.989
 cartography altimeter barometer etc 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 but that's not necessarily what the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.230
 runner needs to be successful 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.989
 on marathon so the gps the gps watch 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 not essential but a good tool that 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.220
 really bring real services not 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.970
 indispensable but it's the little more 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.500
 who can make a difference 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.500
 very well thank you karl thank you
