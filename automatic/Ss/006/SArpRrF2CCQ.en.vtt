00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.490
 do not 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.540
 do not 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.040
 hello to all kids who are is 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.650
 commenting and I bring as a kind of 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.160
 tutorial for where to put the turrets 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.340
 in the cartilage in the stand-up maps 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.380
 the right and the look so come I 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.689
 explaining a little to little good that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.730
 We are in need of this secure site 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.250
 that you already know everyone to read and 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.340
 this team attracted that site with everything 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.290
 we do it in this apart from the map that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.170
 It is very important because if it is not yet 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.690
 here on the back of that controls you 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.910
 very good auto site is this one 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.950
 I would be of the mind and change 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.940
 because everyone who goes up here stays 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.220
 brakes ok and then there's the third 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.900
 site that is very important 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.980
 it's worth it that this is here 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.560
 that can destroy us unless 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.720
 have a big one there is very very 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.580
 important because when you reappear here you 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.159
 he charges everyone to all who cross 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.780
 that 's what load and good here in rail 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.780
 ok I think there is one of the most 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.430
 important because it covers you what I've 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.130
 said before a response 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.179
 both looking from here et cetera as 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.740
 here it went up in Peru &amp; it's worth it 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.479
 this issue and therefore because it covers you 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.359
 answer this side and also take the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.770
 medium but all the most important bad 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.229
 be able to put turrets in all 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.170
 ports are more important and here in 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.439
 slum are these two key sites that I 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.990
 I've seen what they are though from the tower 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.479
 also in perfect here is the tower 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.060
 is here on this site and in the microwave 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.389
 now toaster on the other side because 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.939
 I do not know but inside from the base 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.630
 come on, it's good for me that also 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.340
 what I said 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.340
 you can change the order put the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.700
 microwave up there and bring you scÃ¨ne 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.399
 they have down here 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.020
 and like that can swell kill 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:10.619
 easily and nothing if you liked this 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.540
 gotten without repeating iodine and others I 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.400
 I'm ready on another video with the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.160
 other maps where you can put is in 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.840
 turret and where you can take a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.640
 good streak so nothing is not there 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.800
 favorites and all that subject and I just 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.800
 kids and see you later
