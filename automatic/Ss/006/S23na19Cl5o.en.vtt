00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone with you ds and in this video you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.379
 talk about how to transmit 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.250
 music files from phone to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.140
 computer disk computer to phone 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.320
 first way first way is 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.690
 in transferring music to phone as on 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.439
 normal flash drive for this we should 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.619
 connect the phone via usb cable to 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.619
 computer 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.290
 connected further go to the folder 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.810
 computer 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.940
 windows phone portable device 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.110
 background and music music folder 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.510
 as you can see there are four folders and one 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.360
 music file that I have stored 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.809
 on the phone, you can safely reset it 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 or dragged to the computer in the right place well 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.430
 like a regular flash drive 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.379
 here he appeared excellent 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.170
 just as you can transfer from your computer 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:07.280
 on the phone and the transfer happens very 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.950
 quickly see what shoots in 3 seconds 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.640
 general all and let's talk about the second 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.770
 the way 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.990
 the second way is 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 using windows phone application 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.909
 I run the application requires to connect 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.770
 my phone is already connected 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.280
 but his you 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.439
 those computer music I have here is empty well 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.340
 probably you have the same thing here 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:38.140
 to add music to this app 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.979
 need to go to the library computer 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.979
 and music 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 here it should be added 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.130
 foot or update existing 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 choosing an example the place where it is stored 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.960
 me all music is c music disc 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.960
 click add folder 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.830
 although I still have a stand but 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:10.040
 so it will be more convenient to add a folder in this 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.040
 Ricky good bang 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.760
 see in this library there is this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.500
 folder containing the music that there is something there is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.020
 how would a sync spot 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.790
 and now in this application appeared 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.030
 all music 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.240
 there is in this folder that's because 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.420
 and now in order to sync 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.110
 all the music with the phone you need to press 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.790
 sing own music and press tink and wait 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.790
 I started synchronization 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.450
 just as you can drink 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.000
 laying phone phone and see 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.930
 existing songs on the phone and them too 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.930
 can also 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.930
 synchronize 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.370
 which but now is going to retake 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.370
 transfer I am not a museum 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.370
 25 left 20 20 fast enough 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.370
 is transmitted 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.920
 three two one great Viti immediately 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.800
 appeared all the tracks on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.960
 the phone 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.730
 and here is the example of the songs you wanted 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.250
 throw in order to throw me 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.620
 have to 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.690
 tick them off the same way 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.170
 here to delete on the phone and you can 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.490
 save to the computer zazhilsya them then 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.080
 computer 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.170
 and now they owe me somewhere 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.370
 will appear 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:58.209
 but the classics folder itself 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.209
 she appeared 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.520
 You can also control the music here. 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.970
 you can transfer individual files 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.970
 mark and press and 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.940
 and the third way is 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.940
 views of music in the skydrive cloud need 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.970
 go to live.com log in with your 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.970
 account 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.940
 and go from which 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:35.680
 create an example of any folder I will call 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:40.430
 folder with the name of the music will be 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.439
 go into it and upload this music 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.039
 which I really want is not 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.039
 convenient way 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:55.040
 because to load this oven 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.360
 one for the whole example 15 megabytes needed 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.360
 have a very fast internet connection 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.150
 there is one track at 50 60 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.150
 kilobytes per second is very risky 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.340
 and in principle the place of sky drive is not so 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.340
 and a lot of only about seven apples 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.750
 waiting bye 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.210
 the track will load 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.949
 he can no longer wait and, in principle 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:36.830
 go to the phone i'm on the phone and now 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.830
 can unplug usb cable from it 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:45.439
 first of all we transmitted music at 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.180
 help ordinary conductor 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.860
 but even with the windows application 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.479
 phone 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.990
 all this music is stored in the music player 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.990
 + video 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:07.669
 here are all the songs that were transmitted here 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.870
 they appeared in this player 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.240
 what did i drop into the music folder 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:20.389
 and also use the windows application 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:23.729
 phone is fine but I downloaded the song 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.979
 skydrive passing skydrive for this 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.979
 use a special application 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:40.830
 Now there is a music folder and you can 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:44.879
 will this music open as you see it 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:51.210
 Immediately loaded to save it for now 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:53.629
 what does not work by the way I wonder how 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.599
 transfer music 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:07:00.120
 skydrive phones now I'll stop go 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:13.310
 on the composition 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:13.310
 Here's an example so it does not work and if so 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.600
 you can send the same through 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.810
 mail 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:27.950
 download download fails 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.970
 Basically this is not necessary and of all 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.320
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:36.040
 if you have any questions ask 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.040
 thank you all bye
