00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
gonna take the front end of that circle

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.930 
gonna take the front end of that circle
with<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.810> outside<00:03:21.810> color<00:03:22.370> facing<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:25.050> eyes

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
with the outside color facing the eyes

with the outside color facing the eyes
just<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:30.739> up<00:03:32.060> through<00:03:33.060> that

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
just like that and then up through that

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.260 
just like that and then up through that
now<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> point<00:03:35.670> probably<00:03:36.060> about

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
now if you get to a point probably about

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.030 
now if you get to a point probably about
halfway<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.140> can't<00:03:37.410> really<00:03:37.680> pull<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
halfway that you can't really pull the

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.630 
halfway that you can't really pull the
circle<00:03:38.400> anymore<00:03:38.640> I'm<00:03:39.450> gonna<00:03:39.600> flip<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.110> inside

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
circle anymore I'm gonna flip it inside

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.050 
circle anymore I'm gonna flip it inside
out<00:03:43.400> then<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.930> kind<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.290> already<00:03:46.680> in<00:03:46.770> place

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
out then it's kind of already in place

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.090 
out then it's kind of already in place
and<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:50.270> carry<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.840> way<00:03:52.110> when

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
and you can just carry on this way when

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.530 
and you can just carry on this way when
you<00:03:53.190> get<00:03:53.370> all<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.700> way<00:03:53.790> around<00:03:54.090> your<00:03:54.270> circle

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you get all the way around your circle

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.320 
you get all the way around your circle
tie<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.230> off<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.190> order<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.520> do<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> we're

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
tie it off and in order to do that we're

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.940 
tie it off and in order to do that we're
just<00:03:57.480> gonna<00:03:57.660> go<00:03:57.959> back<00:03:58.230> through<00:03:58.530> our<00:03:58.560> very

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
just gonna go back through our very

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.060 
just gonna go back through our very
first<00:03:59.370> stitch<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.300> then<00:04:00.560> back<00:04:01.560> through<00:04:01.860> with

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
first stitch and then back through with

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.500 
first stitch and then back through with
that<00:04:02.250> loop<00:04:03.410> pull<00:04:04.410> tight<00:04:04.940> back<00:04:05.940> through<00:04:06.330> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that loop pull tight back through that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.410 
that loop pull tight back through that
loop<00:04:06.780> hold<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.100> one<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.850> pull<00:04:09.150> tight

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
loop hold on to this one and pull tight

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.660 
loop hold on to this one and pull tight
and<00:04:09.450> then<00:04:09.810> all<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:11.010> way<00:04:11.100> through<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.519> loop

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
and then all the way through that loop

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.200 
and then all the way through that loop
clip<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.690> off<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.950> can<00:04:14.100> trim<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.430> excess<00:04:14.820> or

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
clip it off you can trim the excess or

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.640 
clip it off you can trim the excess or
not<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.690> doesn't<00:04:15.990> really<00:04:16.080> matter<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:16.560> gonna
