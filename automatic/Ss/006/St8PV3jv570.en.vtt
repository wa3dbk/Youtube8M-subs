00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.920
 4 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.920
 she 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.660
 the series is not a fantasy with a third tournament for 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.470
 developers like humans on the strategy of his universe 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.730
 to an active complicity it was not only beautiful but also very good 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 does but in addition to struggling to understand it he is smart 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.749
 with his class system 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.409
 his twists and turns and these memorable characters he had what 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.980
 he spent hours without realizing it 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 the boring thing is that you have to stay in a chain that can read newspapers 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.500
 it's the strike 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.520
 and then nicolas douchez square enix put themselves in the lead to make the game 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.309
 family so we hit a version completely then direction means 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.570
 meant for all the good it's the name of the first qualified added piles of 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.960
 tricks treating like judges 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 the hero to present the show all Europe by maxime zuber 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.450
 I know it will remain my game there was enough to be very frustrated in front of the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.070
 mess that square enix had done 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 the rest happens on ds and one wonders if it will succeed not raised 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.980
 level 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.870
 so that's okay 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.600
 at the time the states that it would be stupid not to cumulate 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 in bars of this type 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.700
 his look on game boy advance the player could lose all hope of good 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
 the first battle that was nothing but a battle he's leading 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.980
 right now in the bath dallas we do not deal with a few things 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.220
 roman pool 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.600
 a small and arrogant client dem that do not listen to adults and who 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.710
 only thinks we will not see that no one will embody 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.180
 made 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.300
 and that is by arranging the library that would find arranged on a table 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.660
 but the only woman in the library 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.840
 nobody else 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.990
 the purpose according to areva then the blog 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 firefighters fighting by ippon 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 the story revolves around the game of the euro and those back in his 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.649
 world very quickly it will become largely secondary 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:12.499
 and then will not be 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.979
 the minister's statements to the chain 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.979
 square enix killed three people 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.499
 while the credibility of the game has already taken a big hit when we 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.429
 realizes that the badger who acts as a hero manages to wield the sword the 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:36.089
 magic the fighting techniques of ninjas in landlord of supporters of the left 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.139
 in less than six hours 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.849
 we must remedy 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.540
 we will be between ubisoft kind of bitch of the same age that will serve 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.069
 of sentimental connection the story of the film the co-creative roundup had done in 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.999
 his time with not a fantasy 7 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.759
 he mentioned implicitly we feel clearly that there was want to shoot 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.569
 painlessly to hide the lack of consistency of the scenario and then 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.359
 now 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 as if they realized that some players who lived 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.669
 there was no one in front of hannah montana 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.709
 some pros players attention 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.819
 to form but when we look at the form we should not hesitate to 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.819
 preventive title 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.439
 by lobbying like Hamburg we are too soon its limits 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.229
 taking into account the monumental wanks to any form of adversity also if the 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.189
 can it appear and to the words that the game quickly enough the story 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.629
 however, is not resources 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.030
 it's just an idea that is lacking so we balance states and heaps 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.620
 of missions that are alike we propose options that are not used to 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.199
 nothing and fighter classes so useful for Team 2 in 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.859
 January 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.139
 it's simple there we see all the classes offered to players 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.199
 there are at least half who are alike a good third who offers 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:42.510
 power there is no function of conservatives who use them another 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.789
 third for state operations which we do not care royally since we 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.079
 are favorites will be given oracle knee and still a small part that 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.169
 was good on paper but that would be miserably fart 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.269
 when his father 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.359
 it remains so 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.009
 3,300 people 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.399
 and then you have to find them always to be illustrated then there I 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.639
 knew also did something good au gratin like for the game version 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.569
 boy advance it's the men who want the abilities so it avoids 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.539
 to always have to walk to claim the summer for example and his fortune 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.909
 player tried everything 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.099
 can have more complete units possible 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.139
 but when you want small country 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.359
 it is already necessary to predict on the merchants propose 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.989
 to note the skills that can be gained 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.799
 in a press the characteristics of the character 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.430
 see site used tears and skill what's up in the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
 merchant buy bordaxar equipped the unit 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.189
 I did not vote to the highest degree 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.539
 anyway a good technique is to buy more merchants 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.539
 propose because Argentina for a fee for the round 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.090
 the twin 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.090
 you find and why not create a fund 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.410
 so we could say that it's a good initiative that brings together 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.259
 continuity with the episode before but the two young people do not have the slightest 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.340
 souvenir control 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.449
 it's supposed to be the same places but apart from a few rare 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.880
 years ago there is nothing that also proves that both adventures 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.389
 even basing where m it feels more the wanking team who did not want 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.809
 not too much 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.779
 it remains pleasing to the eye but the decorations are not so many that it 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
 and we will very soon have the impression of always seeing the same 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.620
 but we will follow him 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.910
 the bastards none and gives practical lessons - wall street that evokes 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.910
 also a criticism 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.809
 my father 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.929
 ok it's not dangerous it appears in the sector as a whole if 

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:53.929
 everything is happening like paris date 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.200
 it because jousting statistics that ultimately only count on March 29 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.440
 beyond 2008 and supporter of the vast majority of classes that 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.080
 pollute the game we will quickly realize that the best strategy 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.700
 would be to run into the pile simply by getting fed up with 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.589
 healer warriors in the lot 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.439
 it gives good results 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.860
 we move to the sides we are so we will practically 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.899
 always at 99% chance of success there is only the number of health points 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.009
 how did he do it 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.099
 the computer with this rare ability to play like a human being 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.990
 can these absences not have dissipated is that very rarely 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.759
 worry 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.909
 he does not concentrate his costs his unit is weak he does not expect 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.900
 consistent defensive they always use the same table runners and 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.779
 it does not take into account the characteristics of each 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.779
 and then there is the return of the laws 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.119
 it is forbidden to use the power of the Templars 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.949
 the euro area has reached this class 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.000
 if we compare with that open to the outputs on something not very 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.419
 strong business expertise absolutely not 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:07.589
 however you have to recognize some power 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.930
 when we look at the time I spent on it scary 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.009
 the institute eventually it may not be that bad
