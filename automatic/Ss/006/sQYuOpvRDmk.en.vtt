fish<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> boat<00:02:59.260> or<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.990> think<00:03:01.990> the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
fish to the boat or so I think the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.920 
fish to the boat or so I think the
fights<00:03:02.410> been<00:03:02.620> off<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:02.800> little<00:03:03.100> bit<00:03:03.280> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.590 
fantastic we're gonna have a lot of fun
and<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.680> mean<00:03:12.430> no<00:03:12.610> we're<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.210> having<00:03:13.570> fun

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.630 
and I mean no we're not having fun
that's<00:03:13.990> right<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:15.100> we<00:03:15.130> still<00:03:15.280> had<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> lot<00:03:15.520> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
that's right but we still had a lot of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160 
that's right but we still had a lot of
water<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.970> cover<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.480> hopefully<00:03:16.870> we'll<00:03:17.020> get

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
water to cover so hopefully we'll get

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.510 
water to cover so hopefully we'll get
back<00:03:17.350> with<00:03:17.560> some<00:03:17.710> action<00:03:18.040> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.250> end<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
back with some action on the end of the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.410 
back with some action on the end of the
line<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:22.450> right<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:24.490> got<00:03:24.640> Greg<00:03:24.880> into<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.210> fish

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
line all right we got Greg into a fish

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.770 
line all right we got Greg into a fish
here<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.850> minute<00:03:28.180> today<00:03:28.300> we've<00:03:28.630> been

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
here one a minute today we've been

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.090 
here one a minute today we've been
working<00:03:29.110> hard<00:03:29.140> Adam<00:03:29.680> but<00:03:29.830> they've<00:03:29.950> been

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
working hard Adam but they've been

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.730 
working hard Adam but they've been
coming<00:03:30.600> they've<00:03:31.600> been<00:03:31.720> coming<00:03:31.930> we're<00:03:32.230> kind<00:03:32.710> of

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
coming they've been coming we're kind of

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.220 
coming they've been coming we're kind of
sitting<00:03:32.920> in<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.220> big<00:03:33.430> riffle<00:03:33.790> here<00:03:34.230> definitely

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
sitting in a big riffle here definitely

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.950 
sitting in a big riffle here definitely
seems<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.920> nymphs<00:03:36.280> have<00:03:36.430> been<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.960> the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
seems like the nymphs have been a the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.300 
seems like the nymphs have been a the
way<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.170> go<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.710> far<00:03:38.920> today

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
way to go so far today

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.760 
way to go so far today
I<00:03:40.020> think<00:03:41.020> that's<00:03:41.170> going<00:03:41.320> a<00:03:41.410> little<00:03:41.440> bit<00:03:41.710> deeper

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
I think that's going a little bit deeper

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.840 
I think that's going a little bit deeper
a<00:03:42.340> little<00:03:42.880> lower<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.450> little<00:03:43.600> slower

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.830 

like<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.940> said<00:03:48.120> they've<00:03:48.270> been<00:03:48.300> coming<00:03:48.540> they've

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
like I said they've been coming they've

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.450 
like I said they've been coming they've
been<00:03:48.960> coming<00:03:49.140> slow<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:49.920> surely<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:51.740> just<00:03:52.740> had

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
been coming slow but surely I just had

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.010 
been coming slow but surely I just had
one<00:03:53.640> just<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.880> few<00:03:54.060> moments<00:03:54.360> before<00:03:54.420> gray<00:03:54.810> got

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
one just a few moments before gray got

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.760 
one just a few moments before gray got
this<00:03:55.200> one<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.590> we<00:03:55.710> switched<00:03:55.980> up<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.460> rods<00:03:56.790> I

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.350 

think<00:04:01.770> we've<00:04:01.890> got<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.040> big<00:04:02.550> hairs<00:04:02.850> hair<00:04:03.090> on

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
think we've got a big hairs hair on

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.449 
think we've got a big hairs hair on
there<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.780> then<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.860> know<00:04:04.890> some<00:04:05.160> sort<00:04:05.370> of

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
there and then you know some sort of

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.550 
there and then you know some sort of
hatching<00:04:05.850> pupa<00:04:06.300> gluing<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.470> you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
hatching pupa gluing to all of you

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:26.330 
hatching pupa gluing to all of you
merger<00:04:07.920> type<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.250> thing<00:04:25.070> any<00:04:26.070> thing<00:04:26.220> about

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
merger type of thing any thing about

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.600 
merger type of thing any thing about
being<00:04:26.669> over<00:04:26.880> here<00:04:26.910> say<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.270> never<00:04:27.510> know<00:04:28.610> what

know<00:05:40.430> like<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.700> said<00:05:40.910> we've<00:05:41.060> been<00:05:41.210> hitting<00:05:41.390> them

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
know like I said we've been hitting them

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.020 
know like I said we've been hitting them
slow<00:05:41.960> but<00:05:42.200> steady<00:05:42.410> all<00:05:42.680> day<00:05:42.890> and<00:05:43.130> we<00:05:43.730> still<00:05:43.820> got

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
a lot of water to cover too so we'll see

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.210 
a lot of water to cover too so we'll see
