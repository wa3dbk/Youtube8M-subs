00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.430
 Welcome here to this new video 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 and well it 's a weird video because 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.279
 well I have information about the new 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.990
 Dragon Ball movie with a gameplay 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.960
 of revolution because I do not have any 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
 game of dragon ball then we are not going to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.779
 talk about this information that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.390
 well you know that a new one was revealed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 movie that will be for 2015 in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.509
 japan what good 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.929
 the movie is about what it is 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.300
 well in long ens and what good was revealed 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.489
 what is good in an image and in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.870
 the translation says the worst wish of the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.680
 history is the beginning of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.640
 despair 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.590
 yenlong the eternal dragon ok in this case 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.900
 a lot of information was revealed 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.670
 I believe important and it is that good 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.220
 we have the fact that good is going to be 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.690
 again produced by tony animation 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.490
 so well let's see what's coming 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.370
 being both drawings and animation very 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.090
 similar to the movie that came out 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.150
 previously that of the battle of the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.310
 gods and well then in addition to all this 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.079
 Well that information instead I 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.000
 it seemed important and that's what they say 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.650
 which is a sequence a sequel to the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.930
 movie however it is not known if it is 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.270
 a merely numerical sequel or the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 fact that the story is going to be 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.530
 a direct continuation of the movie 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 of the battle of the gods in this case 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 I think it's going to be a continuation 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.509
 direct of what is the battle of light and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.219
 I know that good was reported about 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.590
 probably a new series that was going 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.240
 to work from this not then 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.579
 it would not be too crazy to think that it's going to be 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.319
 a continuation before the new series 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.549
 that is going to produce not here I'm going to 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.860
 show what the two saying 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 images that appear on the website of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.450
 dragon ball and good for you the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.429
 check or they are not as I say there are not many 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.069
 there are only two I liked the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.420
 Drawings of the drawing style and good is 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.450
 possible that what is being the 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.909
 movie is dubbed into our language 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 we know the success so impressive that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.539
 had the battle of the gods at least 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 here in mexico and what good 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.679
 obviously we want if we want 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.099
 to continue working in this way in 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.239
 which give us quality dubbing 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.860
 with the original voices 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.869
 you simply have to support the product 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.509
 I do not and I think the Abbe videos 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.819
 he supported me pretty well in mexico I went 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.040
 to the premiere however good I think I 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.829
 that a lot of people were watching it and so on 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.600
 and supported quite not then in this 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.350
 good case we can wait 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.150
 I hope I hope it's done now 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.680
 do such a good dubbing job 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.420
 as it was done in what was the abbot of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.670
 the gods and how good I think a lot 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.880
 people are happy with this 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.410
 in this case good what is to say 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.180
 that the creator of dragon ball is going to be 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.010
 in charge of what is let 's say the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.600
 supervision of the film so 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.250
 we can hope that he has a little 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.710
 of quality I do not think there's any 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.350
 problem with respect to that and good 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.390
 In addition to all this, I think that a 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.060
 people are giving you again as a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.650
 space in everything that fits dragon 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.410
 ball we do not know that in a certain way 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.970
 Well, he is not half dead because 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.830
 well that is not the term however 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.660
 Well, a lot of people were already starting it 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.910
 to forget in Japan how good is the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.710
 birthplace of the series because good 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.090
 there were new productions and so on and so 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.100
 dragon ball as you want already has its 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.470
 not years but in this case good 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.210
 are giving more life to what it is that so 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.530
 that the series in this case with the 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.630
 movies and with the new series that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.950
 probably come out and good people 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.810
 leave me here tell us what you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.640
 they think about this not calling them 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.340
 the attention or you who think with the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.560
 title not of what is the worst dense of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 the story to see what it is 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.370
 remember that people are not earning from the 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.660
 story really and that does not count is 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.610
 Good people, because here I'm fired 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.610
 us the next and bye 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.030
 all right
