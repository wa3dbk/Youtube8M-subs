00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
streak that right there was actually a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.230 
streak that right there was actually a
really<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.540> idea<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.990> my<00:01:28.080> personal<00:01:28.320> opinion

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
really good idea in my personal opinion

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.550 
really good idea in my personal opinion
one<00:01:30.240> thing<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> say<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.200> his<00:01:31.320> class

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
one thing I do have to say but his class

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
one thing I do have to say but his class
setup<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.430> quite<00:01:32.670> sure<00:01:32.700> why<00:01:33.030> he

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
setup is that I'm not quite sure why he

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
setup is that I'm not quite sure why he

runs scavengers till late newest streak

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
runs scavengers till late newest streak
I<00:01:35.460> always<00:01:35.909> thought<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> bad

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
I always thought I was kind of a bad

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240 
I always thought I was kind of a bad
thing<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> guess<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.040> can't<00:01:38.220> be

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
thing to do that but I guess it can't be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
thing to do that but I guess it can't be
that<00:01:38.340> bad<00:01:38.640> considering<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.689> does

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that bad considering you know he does

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.840 
that bad considering you know he does
okay<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> always<00:01:41.070> liked<00:01:41.310> scavenger

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
okay with it I always liked scavenger

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
okay with it I always liked scavenger
within<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.659> perk<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.290> or<00:01:43.560> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
within my first perk or two or I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.200 
within my first perk or two or I
actually<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> run<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.640> starting<00:01:45.000> perk

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
actually like to run as my starting perk

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.480 
actually like to run as my starting perk
when<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.450> used<00:01:45.600> specialist<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.380> i<00:01:46.409> am<00:01:47.280> was

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
when I used specialist that way i am was

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
when I used specialist that way i am was
never<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.759> problem<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:48.869> guess<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.259> comes

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
never a problem but i guess it all comes

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.690 
never a problem but i guess it all comes
down<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.680> preference<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.369> guess<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.509> yeah<00:01:52.700> like

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
down to preference I guess but yeah like

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
down to preference I guess but yeah like
I<00:01:53.820> said<00:01:54.119> um<00:01:54.689> right<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.710> he's<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
I said um right here I think he's just

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.319 
I said um right here I think he's just
trying<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> play<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.790> defensive<00:01:57.210> he

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
trying to play a bit defensive he

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
trying to play a bit defensive he
realized<00:01:57.689> he's<00:01:57.840> had<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> specialist<00:01:58.530> bonus<00:01:58.740> for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
realized he's had a specialist bonus for

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.350 
realized he's had a specialist bonus for
a<00:01:58.979> bit<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.250> he's<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> streak<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
a bit so he's on a bit of a streak and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.969 
a bit so he's on a bit of a streak and
by<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.899> point<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.380> he's<00:02:01.530> thinking

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
by this point in the game he's thinking

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
by this point in the game he's thinking
well<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:02.670> lab<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.119> might<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.420> able<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.719> a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
well my lab I might be able to get a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
well my lab I might be able to get a
MOAB<00:02:04.079> sooner<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.530> later<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.570> he's<00:02:06.570> playing<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
MOAB sooner or later so he's playing a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.479 
MOAB sooner or later so he's playing a
little<00:02:06.930> more<00:02:07.140> cautious<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:08.099> thing<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
little more cautious one thing that I

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
little more cautious one thing that I
would<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.060> prefer<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.629> he<00:02:09.690> did<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.110> pick

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
would kind of prefer that he did is pick

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.440 
would kind of prefer that he did is pick
up<00:02:10.500> more<00:02:10.649> tags<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.819> played<00:02:12.270> with

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
up more tags now I have played with

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.380 
up more tags now I have played with
screaming<00:02:12.900> bam<00:02:13.050> bam

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
screaming bam bam

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.699 
screaming bam bam
before<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:16.110> realized<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.500> debt

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
before and I I realized kind of debt

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:18.900 
before and I I realized kind of debt
it's<00:02:18.040> nothing<00:02:18.220> he<00:02:18.459> doesn't<00:02:18.700> play<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
it's nothing he doesn't play the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.750 
it's nothing he doesn't play the
objective<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:20.080> him<00:02:20.290> walk<00:02:20.500> by<00:02:20.770> tags

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
objective but I see him walk by tags

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.059 
objective but I see him walk by tags
every<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.300> often<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.350> can't<00:02:23.620> help<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
every so often and I can't help it you

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.380 
every so often and I can't help it you
know<00:02:24.160> well<00:02:24.459> sometimes<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.090> don't<00:02:25.150> need<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
know well sometimes you don't need to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.790 
know well sometimes you don't need to
pick<00:02:25.510> up<00:02:25.630> every<00:02:25.930> tag<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.319> if<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> bit

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
pick up every tag and if you have a bit

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.199 
pick up every tag and if you have a bit
of<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.980> lead<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.430> fine<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.880> kill<00:02:28.030> confirmed

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
of a lead it's fine and kill confirmed

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.230 
of a lead it's fine and kill confirmed
and<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:30.340> know<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.850> really<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.090> big

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
and you know it's not really a big

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.670 
and you know it's not really a big
problem<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.170> bit<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.470> close

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
problem but if it's a bit of a close

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380 
problem but if it's a bit of a close
game<00:02:32.920> like<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.400> right<00:02:33.550> now<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:34.000> think<00:02:34.030> it'd

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
game like it is right now I think it'd

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.390 
game like it is right now I think it'd
be<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.540> better<00:02:35.140> idea<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.709> here<00:02:35.890> pick<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
be a better idea if here pick up a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
be a better idea if here pick up a
couple<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.820> tags<00:02:37.060> like<00:02:37.330> he<00:02:37.450> does<00:02:37.600> there

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
couple of the tags like he does there

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050 
couple of the tags like he does there
which<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.200> always<00:02:38.380> good<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.760> always<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
which is always good but it's always a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.790 
which is always good but it's always a
good<00:02:40.239> thing<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.600> just<00:02:40.720> remind<00:02:41.140> him<00:02:41.260> because<00:02:41.680> I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
good thing and just remind him because I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.140 
good thing and just remind him because I
know<00:02:41.830> he's<00:02:42.100> probably<00:02:42.280> walking<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.850> watch<00:02:43.000> this

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
know he's probably walking to watch this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.790 
know he's probably walking to watch this
video<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.900> always<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.230> really<00:02:44.380> good<00:02:44.590> thing<00:02:44.620> to

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
video it's always a really good thing to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.650

pick<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:45.280> tags<00:02:45.489> because<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.000> realize<00:02:46.510> you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
instead of going through the middle you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.880

that was really good and really smart he

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.610 
that was really good and really smart he
does<00:03:44.950> seem<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.459> some<00:03:45.840> map<00:03:46.840> knowledge<00:03:47.350> and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
does seem to have some map knowledge and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.199 
does seem to have some map knowledge and
it<00:03:47.739> really<00:03:47.980> did<00:03:48.160> pay<00:03:48.370> off<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> got<00:03:48.940> small

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it really did pay off so you got small

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.940 
it really did pay off so you got small
things<00:03:49.450> like<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:50.320> either<00:03:50.560> make<00:03:50.769> or

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
things like that can either make or

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.400 
things like that can either make or
break<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.190> game<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.870> right<00:03:52.870> there<00:03:53.110> really
