mr. Z Rollins has a question about
competition<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:08.480> want<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> know<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.170> if

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
competition I want to know is it if

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.200 
competition I want to know is it if
there's<00:00:10.740> any<00:00:10.950> way<00:00:11.099> possible<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.120> on

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
there's any way possible I can do it on

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.690 
there's any way possible I can do it on
my<00:00:12.330> own<00:00:12.360> own<00:00:12.840> other<00:00:13.679> than<00:00:13.950> getting<00:00:14.099> posing

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
my own own other than getting posing

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.550 
my own own other than getting posing
training<00:00:15.139> yes<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.470> think<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.580> possible<00:00:18.560> if

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
training yes I think it's possible if

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
training yes I think it's possible if
you<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.220> your<00:00:20.430> research<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.210> your

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
you do your research and you do your

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.920 
you do your research and you do your
homework<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.609> have<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> good<00:00:23.939> nutrition

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
homework and you have a good nutrition

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.710 
homework and you have a good nutrition
plan<00:00:25.369> set<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.359> don't<00:00:27.570> cheat

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
plan set up and you don't cheat

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.229 
plan set up and you don't cheat
nutrition<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> biggest<00:00:32.239> part

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
nutrition is I think the biggest part

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.729 
nutrition is I think the biggest part
and<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> whole<00:00:33.750> thing<00:00:34.020> training<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and the whole thing training is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
and the whole thing training is
important<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> cardio<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> important

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
important and the cardio is important

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.410 
important and the cardio is important
but<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:37.230> you're<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.590> being<00:00:38.070> yourself<00:00:38.420> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but if you're not being yourself the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.440 
but if you're not being yourself the
right<00:00:39.629> amount<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> protein<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.649> stay<00:00:40.890> full<00:00:41.450> but

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
right amount of protein to stay full but

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
right amount of protein to stay full but
you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.600> yet<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.620> lean<00:00:43.860> while<00:00:44.399> you're

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you know yet get lean while you're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
you know yet get lean while you're
getting<00:00:44.789> ready<00:00:46.070> especially<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.250> guys<00:00:47.370> if

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
getting ready especially for guys if

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.220 
getting ready especially for guys if
you're<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:47.969> hard<00:00:48.270> enough<00:00:48.360> you're<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.020> going

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you're not hard enough you're not going

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.740 
you're not hard enough you're not going
to<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.469> well<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:51.710> if<00:00:52.710> you're<00:00:52.860> too<00:00:53.360> too<00:00:54.360> thin

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to do well and if you're too too thin

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
to do well and if you're too too thin
you're<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.789> want

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you're not going to do well so you want

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
you're not going to do well so you want

full and if you have good symmetry on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.340 
full and if you have good symmetry on
top<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> you're<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.170> really

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.730 

okay<00:01:20.160> here's<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:21.030> 30<00:01:21.690> Carmen<00:01:24.470> hi<00:01:25.470> cooked

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
okay here's one from 30 Carmen hi cooked

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.500 
okay here's one from 30 Carmen hi cooked
up<00:01:25.860> what's<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> difference<00:01:26.430> between<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:27.120> and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
up what's the difference between way and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.810 
up what's the difference between way and
egg<00:01:28.080> white<00:01:28.440> protein<00:01:28.470> you're<00:01:29.280> using<00:01:29.550> way<00:01:30.510> right

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
egg white protein you're using way right

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.800 
egg white protein you're using way right
this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.060> egg<00:01:33.330> white<00:01:33.540> protein<00:01:35.180> does<00:01:36.180> egg<00:01:36.600> white

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this is egg white protein does egg white

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
this is egg white protein does egg white
protein<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:37.410> you<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.800> be<00:01:38.010> what<00:01:38.580> do<00:01:38.700> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
protein make you all be what do you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.660 
protein make you all be what do you
think<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.200> j<00:01:40.200> raw<00:01:40.440> protein<00:01:40.710> I've<00:01:41.460> never

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think about j raw protein I've never

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.380 
think about j raw protein I've never
heard<00:01:41.910> of<00:01:42.060> j<00:01:42.300> raw<00:01:42.510> protein<00:01:43.760> yeah<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.000> use

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
heard of j raw protein yeah I just use

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.800 
heard of j raw protein yeah I just use
oh<00:01:45.750> oh<00:01:46.440> whey<00:01:47.040> protein<00:01:50.180> basically<00:01:51.180> anyway
