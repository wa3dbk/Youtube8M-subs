happier it was a long process to find
exactly<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.329> combination<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.399> changes

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
exactly the right combination of changes

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
exactly the right combination of changes
to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> drum<00:00:48.059> sound<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:48.989> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to make the drum sound the way we do but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.490 
to make the drum sound the way we do but
a<00:00:49.620> couple<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.460> highlights<00:00:51.020> right<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.199> it's

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
a couple of highlights right now it's

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.910 
a couple of highlights right now it's
got<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> 10<00:00:53.100> ply<00:00:53.340> shell<00:00:53.969> all<00:00:54.270> maple

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
got a 10 ply shell all maple

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
got a 10 ply shell all maple
there's<00:00:56.399> no<00:00:56.610> filler<00:00:56.910> applies<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there's no filler applies at all this so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.920 
there's no filler applies at all this so
it's<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.070> same<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.730> wood<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.750> 10

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's all the same kind of wood for 10

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.500 
it's all the same kind of wood for 10
plies<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.489> solid<00:01:03.059> aluminum<00:01:03.840> tubes

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
plies it's got solid aluminum tubes

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.870 
plies it's got solid aluminum tubes
connecting<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> top<00:01:06.840> rim<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> bottom<00:01:07.619> rim

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
connecting the top rim to the bottom rim

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
connecting the top rim to the bottom rim
it's<00:01:08.880> got<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.510> ten<00:01:09.750> ply<00:01:09.990> shell<00:01:10.500> allows<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's got the ten ply shell allows it to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.300 
it's got the ten ply shell allows it to
get<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> sharper<00:01:12.030> bearing<00:01:12.420> edge<00:01:12.570> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> bottom

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
get a sharper bearing edge at the bottom

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
get a sharper bearing edge at the bottom
and<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> tubes<00:01:14.939> being<00:01:15.299> solid<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and with the tubes being solid the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.870 
and with the tubes being solid the
vibrations<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.860> sent<00:01:17.100> across<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> drum<00:01:17.700> more

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
vibrations are sent across the drum more

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
vibrations are sent across the drum more
and<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.299> you'll<00:01:18.659> notice<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.409> drum

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and so you'll notice that the drum

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.270 
and so you'll notice that the drum
resonates<00:01:20.130> much<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.890> sort<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> same

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
resonates much more sort of the same

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
resonates much more sort of the same
philosophy<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.000> principles<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
philosophy and principles of some of the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.649 
philosophy and principles of some of the
high-end<00:01:26.100> concert<00:01:26.640> snare<00:01:26.909> drums<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.540> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and the fade and and we're you know

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
and the fade and and we're you know
trying<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.229> come<00:01:34.380> up<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.680> some<00:01:34.890> some<00:01:35.460> classic

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
trying to come up with some some classic

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
trying to come up with some some classic
looks<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> drum<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:38.130> couldn't<00:01:38.340> be

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
looks for the drum and we couldn't be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:02:09.320 
looks for the drum and we couldn't be
happier
