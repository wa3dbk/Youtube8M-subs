00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
actual control arm slides out of here

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.750 
actual control arm slides out of here
gotta<00:01:24.710> put<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> lot<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.190> pressure<00:01:25.340> on<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.610> though

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
gotta put a lot of pressure on it though

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.560 
gotta put a lot of pressure on it though
to<00:01:25.820> get<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.120> out<00:01:30.550> see<00:01:31.550> how<00:01:31.580> bad<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.910> looks<00:01:32.240> that

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
to get it out see how bad it looks that

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:41.020 
to get it out see how bad it looks that
old<00:01:32.750> piece<00:01:32.990> came<00:01:33.290> off<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:38.630> one's<00:01:38.869> bad<00:01:40.030> and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
old piece came off that one's bad and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.660 
old piece came off that one's bad and
then<00:01:41.210> let's<00:01:41.510> see<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.869> one<00:01:42.399> this<00:01:43.399> one's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
then let's see this one this one's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.420 
then let's see this one this one's
relatively<00:01:44.210> alright<00:01:44.560> it's<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:45.800> solid

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
relatively alright it's pretty solid

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.600 
relatively alright it's pretty solid
you<00:01:47.300> can't<00:01:47.509> move<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.869> much<00:01:48.460> no<00:01:49.460> worse

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
you can't move with that much no worse

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.540 
you can't move with that much no worse
nowhere<00:01:50.149> near<00:01:50.360> as<00:01:50.509> close<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.899> moving<00:01:51.140> this<00:01:51.259> one

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
nowhere near as close to moving this one

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.730 
nowhere near as close to moving this one
this<00:01:52.550> one<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.970> just<00:01:53.380> totally<00:01:54.380> shot<00:01:56.740> they're

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
this one is just totally shot they're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.900 
this one is just totally shot they're
just<00:01:57.950> sort<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.160> cool<00:01:58.340> how<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:58.580> see<00:01:58.790> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
just sort of cool how you see the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.450 
just sort of cool how you see the
control<00:01:59.270> arm<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.630> one<00:02:00.560> solid<00:02:01.100> piece<00:02:01.130> of

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
control arm is one solid piece of

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.420 
control arm is one solid piece of
aluminum<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.530> guess<00:02:03.530> these<00:02:03.649> are<00:02:03.710> for<00:02:03.979> weight

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
aluminum I guess these are for weight

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.090 
aluminum I guess these are for weight
savings<00:02:05.619> this<00:02:06.619> is<00:02:06.800> for<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:09.320> like<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.470> DSC

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
savings this is for the it's like a DSC

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.400 
savings this is for the it's like a DSC

it's<00:02:19.610> bolted<00:02:19.880> into<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.360> because<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.470> tells

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
it's bolted into there because it tells

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.229 
it's bolted into there because it tells
the<00:02:21.769> position<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.640> control<00:02:22.790> arm<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:26.030> the

these<00:02:44.269> are<00:02:44.390> actually<00:02:44.660> built<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.190> when<00:02:46.280> you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
these are actually built in so when you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.060 
these are actually built in so when you
buy<00:02:46.459> new<00:02:46.670> control<00:02:47.030> arm<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.330> comes<00:02:47.510> with<00:02:47.660> this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
buy new control arm it comes with this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.150 
buy new control arm it comes with this
and<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> comes<00:02:49.370> with<00:02:49.489> this<00:02:50.290> if<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.440> go<00:02:51.560> back<00:02:51.769> to

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and it comes with this if you go back to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.050 
and it comes with this if you go back to
this<00:02:52.910> side<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.890> right<00:02:55.130> there<00:02:55.400> that's<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this side and right there that's a

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.100 
this side and right there that's a
separate<00:02:56.480> component<00:02:58.450> yeah<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.480> replaced<00:02:59.959> it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
separate component yeah I replaced it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.890 
separate component yeah I replaced it
and<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.709> results<00:03:01.130> for<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.400> were<00:03:01.900> pretty

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and the results for this were pretty

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.440 
and the results for this were pretty
pretty<00:03:03.260> impressive<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.910> whole<00:03:05.120> suspension

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
pretty impressive the whole suspension

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
pretty impressive the whole suspension
tightened<00:03:05.989> up<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.769> car<00:03:06.980> basically

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
tightened up and the car basically

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.210 
tightened up and the car basically
performed<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.030> lot<00:03:08.120> better<00:03:08.360> on<00:03:08.450> turns

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
performed a lot better on turns

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.319 
performed a lot better on turns
especially<00:03:10.220> around<00:03:10.280> turns<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.850> are<00:03:10.940> you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
especially around turns that are you

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.819 
especially around turns that are you
know<00:03:11.420> full<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.750> bumps<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.110> potholes<00:03:12.500> and

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
know full of bumps like potholes and

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.660 
know full of bumps like potholes and
whatnot<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:14.750> definitely<00:03:15.170> helps<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.470> out

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
whatnot it definitely helps it out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.540 
whatnot it definitely helps it out
but<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.880> tell<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:19.550> German

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
but you can tell just a German

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.190 
but you can tell just a German
engineering<00:03:21.000> behind<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.480> control<00:03:21.930> arm<00:03:22.110> is

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
engineering behind this control arm is

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.010 
engineering behind this control arm is
amazing<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.920> American<00:03:25.920> cars<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.430> like

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
amazing that American cars have like

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.420 
amazing that American cars have like
they<00:03:28.020> have<00:03:28.200> sheet<00:03:28.740> metal<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.220> like

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
they have sheet metal that's like

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.070 
they have sheet metal that's like
pressed<00:03:29.820> into<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.210> kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.480> shape<00:03:30.780> it's<00:03:30.990> not

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
pressed into this kind of shape it's not

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.800 
pressed into this kind of shape it's not
a<00:03:31.170> solvent<00:03:31.770> block<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.160> aluminum<00:03:32.550> this<00:03:33.480> isn't

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
a solvent block of aluminum this isn't

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.120 
a solvent block of aluminum this isn't
this<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.050> solid<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:34.740> all<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.040> way

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
this is solid right here all the way

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.060 
this is solid right here all the way
through<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.520> just<00:03:35.580> solid<00:03:36.000> aluminum<00:03:37.070> it's

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
through it's just solid aluminum it's

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.640 
through it's just solid aluminum it's
probably<00:03:38.370> worth<00:03:38.580> like<00:03:38.880> $10<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:39.750> aluminum<00:03:40.440> just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
probably worth like $10 in aluminum just

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.590 
probably worth like $10 in aluminum just
the<00:03:40.830> raw<00:03:41.010> metal<00:03:43.280> yeah<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.030> this<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.570> a

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the raw metal yeah so this is this is a

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.360 
the raw metal yeah so this is this is a
failed<00:03:45.960> control<00:03:46.500> arm<00:03:47.240> that<00:03:48.240> was<00:03:48.390> replaced

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
failed control arm that was replaced

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.680 
failed control arm that was replaced
took<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.430> lot<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.580> effort<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.150> finally

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
took a lot of effort but finally

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.680 
took a lot of effort but finally
replaced<00:03:52.020> it<00:03:53.480> all<00:03:54.480> right<00:03:56.210> I'd<00:03:57.210> recommend

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
replaced it all right I'd recommend

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.910 
replaced it all right I'd recommend
anyone<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:58.830> a<00:03:58.860> BMW<00:03:59.460> e46<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.360> replace<00:04:00.920> the
