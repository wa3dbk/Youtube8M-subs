a week now since I wash my hair in twice
a<00:00:43.980> week<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.700> or<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.289> it's

really just a conditioner but I really
think<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.690> something<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
think it has something to do with the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
think it has something to do with the
conditioner<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.370> literally<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> put

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
conditioner because literally when I put

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
conditioner because literally when I put
the<00:00:51.899> conditioner<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.620> hair<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.219> after<00:00:53.520> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that I just took this week on my hair

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
that I just took this week on my hair
straighten<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> shirt<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.310> have

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
straighten now now the shirt that I have

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 
straighten now now the shirt that I have
on<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> same<00:01:54.390> shirt<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.250> measured<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
on is the same shirt and I measured it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.300 
on is the same shirt and I measured it
while<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.020> from<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.890> gray

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
while I have it on and from my one gray

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.810 
while I have it on and from my one gray
line<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.600> other<00:02:00.810> gray<00:02:01.259> line<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.920> two

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
line to the other gray line is two

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.639 
line to the other gray line is two
inches<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.630> between<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.140> has<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
inches and in between it has like a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.639 
inches and in between it has like a
strip<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.219> olive<00:02:05.909> green<00:02:06.210> line<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.049> basically

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
strip of olive green line so basically

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.270 
strip of olive green line so basically
from<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.160> grade<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.459> another<00:02:08.789> grades

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
from one grade to another grades

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.600 
from one grade to another grades
so<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> olive<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.750> like<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.170> mid<00:02:11.650> marker<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.460> I'm

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
so the olive is like a mid marker so I'm

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.910 
so the olive is like a mid marker so I'm
guessing<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.780> know<00:02:13.900> point<00:02:14.260> 75

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
guessing it's like you know point 75

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.410 
guessing it's like you know point 75
inches<00:02:15.880> or<00:02:16.090> something<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:18.420> get

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
inches or something like that so you get

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.260 
inches or something like that so you get
to<00:02:19.570> see<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:20.530> much<00:02:20.590> my<00:02:20.920> hair<00:02:21.130> has<00:02:21.340> grown<00:02:21.550> in<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
to see how much my hair has grown in the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.260 
to see how much my hair has grown in the
month<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.810> I've<00:02:22.930> been<00:02:23.080> using<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.280> my<00:02:25.000> hair

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
month that I've been using it so my hair

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.630 
month that I've been using it so my hair
is<00:02:25.540> straight<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.200> my<00:02:26.470> roots<00:02:26.830> for<00:02:27.160> some<00:02:27.340> reason

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
is straight but my roots for some reason

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.920 
is straight but my roots for some reason
once<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:27.940> hair<00:02:28.180> gets<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> certain<00:02:28.660> amount<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
once my hair gets a certain amount of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.130 
once my hair gets a certain amount of
new<00:02:29.170> growth<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:30.580> never<00:02:30.820> get<00:02:31.180> my<00:02:31.510> roots<00:02:31.840> like
