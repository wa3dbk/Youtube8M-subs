00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.060 
not entirely sure on how to do things
shibe<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:00.720> not<00:05:00.870> fall<00:05:01.050> in<00:05:01.169> lava<00:05:01.380> when<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:01.949> go

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
shibe and not fall in lava when I go

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.129 
shibe and not fall in lava when I go
into<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.340> nether<00:05:02.520> I'm<00:05:03.419> not<00:05:03.570> sure<00:05:03.750> if<00:05:03.960> that's

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
into the nether I'm not sure if that's

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:11.060 
into the nether I'm not sure if that's
possible<00:05:04.380> though<00:05:09.289> yeah<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.410> then<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.680> makes<00:05:10.860> a

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
possible though yeah and then it makes a

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.909 
possible though yeah and then it makes a
portal<00:05:11.520> for<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.820> here<00:05:12.590> then<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.770> get

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
portal for you here then you get

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.820 
portal for you here then you get
obsidian<00:05:14.280> farming<00:05:19.310> another<00:05:20.310> rack<00:05:20.580> which

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
obsidian farming another rack which

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.480 
obsidian farming another rack which

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.390 

guys<00:05:39.990> when<00:05:40.380> you're<00:05:40.560> mining<00:05:40.919> something<00:05:41.250> like

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
guys when you're mining something like

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.909 
guys when you're mining something like
mushrooms<00:05:41.880> just<00:05:42.389> like<00:05:42.599> mine<00:05:42.840> underneath<00:05:43.229> it

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:06:01.459 

wouldn't<00:05:46.919> fit<00:05:47.340> really<00:06:00.349> here<00:06:01.349> when

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
wouldn't fit really here when

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:02.899 
wouldn't fit really here when
you're<00:06:01.590> mining<00:06:01.889> stuff<00:06:02.159> like<00:06:02.340> mushroom<00:06:02.820> or

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
you're mining stuff like mushroom or

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.540 
you're mining stuff like mushroom or
saplings<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:03.990> planted<00:06:04.349> mind<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.400> block

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
saplings that you planted mind the block

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.990 
saplings that you planted mind the block
underneath<00:06:06.000> them<00:06:06.419> there'd<00:06:06.900> be<00:06:07.080> my<00:06:07.289> advice

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
underneath them there'd be my advice

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.540 
underneath them there'd be my advice
because<00:06:09.000> then<00:06:09.599> you<00:06:10.199> get<00:06:10.409> two<00:06:10.650> blocks<00:06:11.990> because

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
because then you get two blocks because

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.540 
because then you get two blocks because
yeah<00:06:14.550> or<00:06:15.060> maybe<00:06:15.479> not<00:06:15.719> with<00:06:15.840> saplings<00:06:16.400> if<00:06:17.400> you

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
yeah or maybe not with saplings if you

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.209 
yeah or maybe not with saplings if you
like<00:06:17.729> getting<00:06:18.360> rid<00:06:18.719> of<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.870> sapling<00:06:19.380> yeah<00:06:19.740> you

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
like getting rid of the sapling yeah you

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.070 
like getting rid of the sapling yeah you
only<00:06:20.639> need<00:06:20.909> one<00:06:21.180> use<00:06:21.360> of<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.630> item<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:22.050> are

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
only need one use of the item you are

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.730 
only need one use of the item you are
using<00:06:22.320> it's<00:06:22.830> more<00:06:23.280> efficient<00:06:24.530> now<00:06:25.530> I'm

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
using it's more efficient now I'm

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.959 
using it's more efficient now I'm
probably<00:06:26.009> a<00:06:26.159> news<00:06:26.340> until<00:06:26.520> I<00:06:26.699> have<00:06:26.789> a<00:06:26.849> whole

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
probably a news until I have a whole

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.629 
probably a news until I have a whole
staff<00:06:27.180> with<00:06:27.509> number<00:06:27.780> ugh<00:06:28.280> because<00:06:29.280> maverick

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
staff with number ugh because maverick

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.790 
staff with number ugh because maverick
is<00:06:29.789> actually<00:06:30.120> very<00:06:30.150> useful<00:06:30.750> because<00:06:31.050> you<00:06:31.710> can

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
is actually very useful because you can

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.010 
is actually very useful because you can
light<00:06:32.009> it<00:06:32.039> on<00:06:32.219> fire<00:06:32.330> which<00:06:33.330> I<00:06:33.690> should<00:06:33.990> probably

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
light it on fire which I should probably

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.140 
light it on fire which I should probably
do<00:06:35.210> in<00:06:36.210> my<00:06:36.860> display<00:06:37.860> world<00:06:38.159> so<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.760> think<00:06:38.880> I'm

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
do in my display world so I think I'm

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.950 
do in my display world so I think I'm
gonna<00:06:39.240> film

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
gonna film

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.700 
gonna film
the<00:06:40.050> first<00:06:40.460> received<00:06:41.460> my<00:06:41.580> let's<00:06:41.850> play<00:06:42.710> after

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
first to find and whether you can farm

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.400 
first to find and whether you can farm
obsidian<00:07:08.190> from<00:07:08.340> here<00:07:08.780> the<00:07:09.780> way<00:07:09.900> I<00:07:09.930> look<00:07:10.080> that

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
obsidian from here the way I look that

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.310 
obsidian from here the way I look that
you<00:07:10.560> can<00:07:13.099> yeah<00:07:14.210> not<00:07:15.210> very<00:07:15.240> efficiently<00:07:16.080> but

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.320 
you can yeah not very efficiently but

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.810 
you can yeah not very efficiently but
you<00:07:16.500> can<00:07:17.360> ya<00:07:18.360> blue<00:07:19.199> stern<00:07:19.560> father<00:07:20.099> left<00:07:20.610> I

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:37.349 
and finish this episode off then I'll do

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:41.350 
and finish this episode off then I'll do
a<00:07:37.680> let's<00:07:37.919> play<00:07:38.190> episode<00:07:38.310> so<00:07:38.940> see<00:07:39.150> you<00:07:39.240> around

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.180 

now<00:07:42.360> then<00:07:42.569> we<00:07:42.659> simulate<00:07:43.169> the<00:07:43.289> bar<00:07:43.500> for<00:07:43.710> a<00:07:43.770> bit

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.189 

then<00:07:47.690> we<00:07:48.690> give<00:07:48.930> ourselves<00:07:49.020> a<00:07:49.620> block<00:07:49.979> portal

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 
then we give ourselves a block portal

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:57.050 
then we give ourselves a block portal
it's<00:07:52.199> more<00:07:52.409> of<00:07:52.500> a<00:07:52.560> panel<00:07:52.949> really<00:07:53.930> yeah<00:07:55.909> and<00:07:56.909> it

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060 
it's more of a panel really yeah and it

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.060 
it's more of a panel really yeah and it
has<00:07:57.210> gone<00:07:57.650> so<00:07:58.650> i'm<00:07:59.610> shifting
