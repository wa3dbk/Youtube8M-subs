00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hey guys it's Jacqueline here so today I

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey guys it's Jacqueline here so today I
wanted<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.020> do<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> video<00:00:04.740> on<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.930> favorite

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
wanted to do a video on my favorite

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.990 
wanted to do a video on my favorite
lipsticks<00:00:07.410> at<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.830> moment<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.370> they're

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
lipsticks at the moment and they're

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.790 
lipsticks at the moment and they're
actually<00:00:09.179> all<00:00:09.510> gonna<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.929> Revlon<00:00:10.410> because<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
actually all gonna be Revlon because I

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.150 
actually all gonna be Revlon because I
thought<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.460> would<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.700> better<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:13.160> categorize

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
thought it would be better to categorize

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.430 
thought it would be better to categorize
it<00:00:14.190> by<00:00:14.400> brand<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:15.719> kind<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> easier<00:00:16.289> to

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it by brand so it's kind of easier to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
it by brand so it's kind of easier to
determine<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.190> know<00:00:17.310> where<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.330> them<00:00:18.570> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
determine you know where to get them and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.290 
determine you know where to get them and
how<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.740> are<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.279> absolutely<00:00:20.820> love

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
how much they are I absolutely love

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
how much they are I absolutely love
lipsticks<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.020> think<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.470> they<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.650> really
