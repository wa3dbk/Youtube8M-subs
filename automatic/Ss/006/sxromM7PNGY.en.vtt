run dry and break the spring what will

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.890 
run dry and break the spring what will
happen<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.560> incident<00:00:17.310> comes<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.630> it's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
happen is this incident comes up it's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.000 
happen is this incident comes up it's
got<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.380> umbrella<00:00:19.770> shape<00:00:20.220> pop<00:00:20.670> over<00:00:22.010> and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
got a little umbrella shape pop over and

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.920 
got a little umbrella shape pop over and
when<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> folks<00:00:23.670> against<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.269> spring<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
when it folks against this spring it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.910 
when it folks against this spring it
opens<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.619> little<00:00:25.890> punk<00:00:26.099> grill<00:00:26.369> about<00:00:27.920> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
opens that little punk grill about and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
opens that little punk grill about and
what<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.189> does<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.789> changes<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.650> position

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
what it does is it changes the position

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.240 
what it does is it changes the position
of<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.369> piston<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.829> stroke

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of this piston so it's in the up stroke

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.450 
of this piston so it's in the up stroke
becomes<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.440> folks<00:00:37.440> against<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> spring

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
becomes up folks against the spring

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.170 
becomes up folks against the spring
opens<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> valve<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.980> pressurizes<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
opens a valve up now it pressurizes the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.529 
opens a valve up now it pressurizes the
top<00:00:42.450> side<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.230> we've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> Vista

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
top side of this we've got this Vista

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.900 
top side of this we've got this Vista
which<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:45.750> forces<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> system<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.789> me

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
which now forces the system to going me

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.270 
which now forces the system to going me
down<00:00:48.180> we're<00:00:48.570> stroke

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
down we're stroke

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
down we're stroke
so<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.880> three<00:00:51.180> Hendrick<00:00:51.780> racer<00:00:52.260> gets<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so this three Hendrick racer gets to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.790 
so this three Hendrick racer gets to
fray<00:00:52.920> us<00:00:53.130> this<00:00:53.940> piston<00:00:54.630> comes<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.440> top

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
fray us this piston comes up on the top

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.530 
fray us this piston comes up on the top
stroke<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:56.790> strive<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:59.010> spring<00:00:59.540> it

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
stroke and can't strive this spring it

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.900 
stroke and can't strive this spring it
tops<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.290> enough<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.100> never<00:01:02.280> tells<00:01:02.580> it'd<00:01:02.760> be

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
tops out enough that never tells it'd be

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.830 
tops out enough that never tells it'd be
nice<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:03.450> down

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
nice to go back down

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.139 
nice to go back down
that's<00:01:06.380> one<00:01:06.710> one<00:01:07.130> thing<00:01:07.369> all<00:01:07.549> these<00:01:07.820> through

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
that's one one thing all these through

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.569 
that's one one thing all these through
cost<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.380> never<00:01:09.560> want<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.009> let<00:01:10.250> these

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:10.579 
cost is you never want to let these

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.660 
cost is you never want to let these
punks<00:01:11.210> run<00:01:11.540> dry<00:01:12.790> when<00:01:13.790> they<00:01:13.939> run<00:01:14.270> driving<00:01:14.899> pump

punks run dry when they run driving pump

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.730 
punks run dry when they run driving pump
really<00:01:16.670> fast<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.930> they're<00:01:18.140> hammering

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
really fast and they're hammering

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.179 
really fast and they're hammering
against<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:19.430> spring<00:01:20.200> every<00:01:21.200> top<00:01:21.530> stroke<00:01:21.950> is

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
against this spring every top stroke is

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.810 
against this spring every top stroke is
hammering<00:01:22.820> this<00:01:23.149> ring<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.500> will<00:01:24.830> break<00:01:25.310> this

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
hammering this ring you will break this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.480 
hammering this ring you will break this
spring<00:01:26.299> with<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.929> hammering<00:01:27.560> action

spring with the hammering action

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.200 
spring with the hammering action
so<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.659> very<00:01:29.960> important<00:01:30.759> did<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:31.850> run

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
so this is very important did you run

this<00:04:25.930> piece<00:04:26.260> here<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.650> what<00:04:27.160> makes<00:04:27.430> contact

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
this piece here is what makes contact

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.720 
this piece here is what makes contact
with<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:30.450> spring<00:04:32.100> when<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.220> makes<00:04:33.430> contact

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
with this spring when it makes contact

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.750 
with this spring when it makes contact
with<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.240> spring<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.950> good<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.310> will<00:04:36.520> back

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
with the spring so good this will back

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.170 
with the spring so good this will back
up<00:04:36.970> up<00:04:37.120> up<00:04:37.389> up<00:04:37.870> reach<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> bottom<00:04:38.440> here<00:04:39.060> see<00:04:40.060> it

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
up up up up reach the bottom here see it

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.890 
up up up up reach the bottom here see it
moving<00:04:41.370> that's<00:04:42.370> closed<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.200> bottom

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.100 

so<00:04:47.530> when<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.890> is<00:04:47.950> closed<00:04:48.480> this<00:04:49.480> piston<00:04:49.990> is

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
so when this is closed this piston is

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.460 
so when this is closed this piston is
actually<00:04:50.590> able<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.100> move<00:04:52.090> up<00:04:52.510> because<00:04:52.870> it's<00:04:53.260> my

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
actually able to move up because it's my

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.530 
actually able to move up because it's my
hairs<00:04:53.740> being<00:04:54.010> pressurized<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.060> bottom

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
hairs being pressurized on the bottom

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.290 
hairs being pressurized on the bottom
portion<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.230> gold<00:04:56.650> ring<00:04:56.980> this<00:04:57.910> driving

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
portion of this gold ring this driving

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.810 
portion of this gold ring this driving
this<00:04:58.600> piston<00:04:59.050> up<00:04:59.200> now<00:04:59.860> when<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.250> gets<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.700> the

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
this piston up now when it gets to the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.420 
this piston up now when it gets to the
top<00:05:01.060> stroke<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:02.170> it<00:05:02.350> bumps<00:05:02.740> up<00:05:02.860> against<00:05:03.280> this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
top stroke and it bumps up against this

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.000 
top stroke and it bumps up against this
spring<00:05:03.790> it<00:05:04.060> pushes<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.720> down<00:05:05.140> which<00:05:05.560> opens

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
spring it pushes this down which opens

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.970 
spring it pushes this down which opens
that<00:05:06.160> valve<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:06.790> we<00:05:07.480> closes<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.200> top<00:05:08.470> side<00:05:08.800> of

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
that valve and we closes the top side of

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.290 
that valve and we closes the top side of
this<00:05:09.070> valve<00:05:09.400> off<00:05:09.760> which<00:05:10.180> now<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:11.080> hair<00:05:11.350> is

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
this valve off which now the hair is

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.510 
this valve off which now the hair is
pressurizing<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.540> top<00:05:13.810> side<00:05:14.200> of<00:05:14.440> this<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.370> the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
pressurizing the top side of this of the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.270 
pressurizing the top side of this of the
cylinder<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:17.050> pushing<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:17.590> piston<00:05:18.070> back

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
cylinder and pushing this piston back

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.030 
cylinder and pushing this piston back
down<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:21.550> pretty<00:05:21.970> simple<00:05:22.660> maybe<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.710> was<00:05:23.860> able

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
down it's pretty simple maybe I was able

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.720 
down it's pretty simple maybe I was able
to<00:05:24.220> see<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.700> operate<00:05:25.650> be<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.680> lot<00:05:26.890> lot<00:05:27.190> easier<00:05:27.550> to

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
to see it operate be a lot lot easier to

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.700 
to see it operate be a lot lot easier to
explain<00:05:27.850> but<00:05:28.240> it's<00:05:28.420> very<00:05:28.720> it's<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.080> very<00:05:29.290> simple

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
explain but it's very it's a very simple

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.950 
explain but it's very it's a very simple
mechanism<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:31.210> very<00:05:31.360> important<00:05:31.930> that

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
mechanism but it's very important that

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.650 
mechanism but it's very important that
this<00:05:32.140> spring<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:33.070> in<00:05:33.100> working<00:05:33.910> condition

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
this spring is in working condition

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.690 
this spring is in working condition
because<00:05:35.470> if<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.650> reaches<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.130> top<00:05:36.400> and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
because if it reaches the top and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.630 
because if it reaches the top and
doesn't<00:05:37.240> bump<00:05:37.510> against<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.080> spring<00:05:38.530> it's<00:05:39.370> not

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
doesn't bump against the spring it's not

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.300 
doesn't bump against the spring it's not
going<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.000> know<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.510> open<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.200> valve<00:05:41.530> up<00:05:41.980> to

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
going to know to open this valve up to

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.140 
going to know to open this valve up to
go<00:05:42.610> into<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:43.060> down<00:05:43.420> stroke<00:05:44.370> or<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.400> door<00:05:45.880> and

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
go into the down stroke or the door and

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.120 
go into the down stroke or the door and
they<00:05:46.270> distrust<00:05:46.630> oh<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.140> it's<00:05:47.410> very<00:05:47.620> important

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
they distrust oh so it's very important

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.690 
they distrust oh so it's very important
that<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.340> spring<00:05:48.730> isn't<00:05:48.910> working<00:05:49.390> order
