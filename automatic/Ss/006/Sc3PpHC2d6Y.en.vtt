m1216 does not have a lot of range so
you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.210> sure<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.510> stay<00:00:36.719> indoors

not end up in a long line of sight

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.569 
not end up in a long line of sight
because<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> happens<00:00:43.739> chances<00:00:44.430> are

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
because if that happens chances are

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
because if that happens chances are
extremely<00:00:45.300> likely<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.289> not

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
extremely likely that you will not

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440 
extremely likely that you will not
survive<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.890> anyway<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> next<00:00:48.120> thing<00:00:48.360> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
survive that anyway the next thing you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.639 
survive that anyway the next thing you
should<00:00:48.660> keep<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.930> mind<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> should

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
should keep in mind is that you should

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
should keep in mind is that you should
always<00:00:49.800> fire<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.610> full<00:00:50.879> burst<00:00:51.149> basically

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
always fire one full burst basically

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.299 
always fire one full burst basically
when<00:00:52.230> you're<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> gunfight<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
when you're in a gunfight you want to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709 
when you're in a gunfight you want to
make<00:00:53.460> sure<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> fire<00:00:54.090> every<00:00:54.480> four

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
make sure that you fire every four

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.630 
make sure that you fire every four
bullets<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.199> he<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.559> fire<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
bullets that he can fire because when I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
bullets that he can fire because when I
actually<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> use<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.750> m1216<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
actually tried to use the m1216 for the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually tried to use the m1216 for the
first<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.460> used<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
first time I used it kind of like the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
first time I used it kind of like the
r870<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.199> tried<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.129> close<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> my

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
r870 I tried to get as close to my

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
r870 I tried to get as close to my
enemies<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.180> possibly<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.140> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
enemies as I possibly could what you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
enemies as I possibly could what you
should<00:01:04.439> still<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> shouldn't<00:01:05.820> fire

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
should still do but you shouldn't fire

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.760 
should still do but you shouldn't fire
just<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.600> bullet<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
just one bullet that is actually what I

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
just one bullet that is actually what I
did<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.159> only<00:01:08.310> fired<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:09.030> bullet<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.960> hope

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
did I only fired one bullet in the hope

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
did I only fired one bullet in the hope
that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.619> get<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.040> one-hit<00:01:11.490> kill<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> this

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
that I would get a one-hit kill and this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750 
that I would get a one-hit kill and this
is<00:01:12.360> incredibly<00:01:13.200> ineffective<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.070> ended<00:01:14.670> up

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
is incredibly ineffective I ended up

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
is incredibly ineffective I ended up
getting<00:01:14.939> quite<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> few<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.780> markets<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
getting quite a few hit markets and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.570 
getting quite a few hit markets and
because<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.890> actually<00:01:17.040> ended<00:01:17.460> up

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
because of that I actually ended up

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
because of that I actually ended up
dying<00:01:17.880> quite<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> few<00:01:18.479> times<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
dying quite a few times so you want to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
these perks why use these attachments

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.749 
these perks why use these attachments
etcetera<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.680> first<00:01:52.890> off<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> me<00:01:53.520> take

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a look at the attachments we took once

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
a look at the attachments we took once
again<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.159> long<00:01:56.460> barrel<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> laser

again the long barrel and the laser

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
again the long barrel and the laser
sight<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> long<00:01:58.560> barrel<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
sight and the long barrel for those of

sight and the long barrel for those of
you<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.670> simply<00:02:00.119> increases

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you that don't know simply increases

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560 
you that don't know simply increases
your<00:02:00.960> effective<00:02:01.469> range<00:02:01.710> by<00:02:01.890> 15%<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
your effective range by 15% now this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.999 
your effective range by 15% now this
means<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.259> keep<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.500> one-hit

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
means that you will keep that one-hit

guns that do not have a lot of range the
long<00:02:11.520> rail<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.819> actually<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.599> bed

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930

attachments<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.680> could<00:02:13.950> possibly<00:02:14.370> use

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
attachments that you could possibly use

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.819 
attachments that you could possibly use
and<00:02:14.849> then<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> laser<00:02:15.659> side<00:02:16.019> just<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.469> tighten

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
and then the laser side just to tighten

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.589 
and then the laser side just to tighten
my<00:02:16.920> hipfire<00:02:17.340> spread<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:18.209> those<00:02:18.329> of<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.540> that

my hipfire spread for those of you that

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.360 
my hipfire spread for those of you that
don't<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.930> these<00:02:19.230> shotguns<00:02:19.680> literally<00:02:20.189> are

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
don't know these shotguns literally are

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.800 
don't know these shotguns literally are
the<00:02:20.519> most<00:02:20.790> accurate<00:02:21.060> when<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.510> aiming

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the most accurate when you're aiming

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.660 
the most accurate when you're aiming
down<00:02:21.930> sights<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.650> pretty<00:02:23.010> accurate<00:02:23.280> at

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
down sights they are pretty accurate at

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.119 
down sights they are pretty accurate at
close<00:02:24.030> range<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.689> terms<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.049> hip<00:02:25.200> firing<00:02:25.439> but

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
close range in terms of hip firing but

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.860 
close range in terms of hip firing but
the<00:02:26.250> laser<00:02:26.519> side<00:02:26.849> will<00:02:27.060> definitely<00:02:27.480> improve

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the laser side will definitely improve

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.929 
the laser side will definitely improve
hipfire<00:02:28.319> performance<00:02:28.349> by<00:02:29.189> quite<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> bit<00:02:29.639> so

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
hipfire performance by quite a bit so

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.399 
hipfire performance by quite a bit so
that's<00:02:30.060> why<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.269> use<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.200> then<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.379> course

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
that's why I use that and then of course

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.459 
that's why I use that and then of course
d5<00:02:32.010> 795<00:02:32.909> seven<00:02:33.389> is<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:33.870> or<00:02:34.049> less<00:02:34.079> kind<00:02:34.409> of

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
d5 795 seven is more or less kind of

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.410 
d5 795 seven is more or less kind of
like<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> backup<00:02:34.859> weapon<00:02:35.189> like<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:36.000> said<00:02:36.209> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
like a backup weapon like I said this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.879 
like a backup weapon like I said this
gun<00:02:36.689> or<00:02:36.900> any<00:02:37.019> shotgun<00:02:37.379> for<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.650> matter<00:02:37.769> is

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
gun or any shotgun for that matter is

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.740 
gun or any shotgun for that matter is
horrible<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.579> terms<00:02:38.909> of<00:02:39.120> long<00:02:39.450> range

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
horrible in terms of long range

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
horrible in terms of long range
engagements<00:02:40.079> and<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.099> five-seven<00:02:41.700> is

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
engagements and the five-seven is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.309 
engagements and the five-seven is
actually<00:02:42.090> one<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.299> those<00:02:42.389> pistols<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.019> works

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
actually one of those pistols that works

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually one of those pistols that works
pretty<00:02:43.620> well<00:02:43.859> at<00:02:44.040> long<00:02:44.280> range<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.730> medium

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
pretty well at long range and medium

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
pretty well at long range and medium
range<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.359> well<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.169> is<00:02:46.260> why<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.409> use<00:02:46.769> that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
range as well so that is why I use that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.619 
range as well so that is why I use that
but<00:02:47.159> if<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.760> type<00:02:47.939> of<00:02:48.000> player<00:02:48.389> is

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
but if you are the type of player is

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.210 
but if you are the type of player is
literally<00:02:49.079> just<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.680> pick<00:02:49.859> up<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.159> on

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
literally just going to pick up and on

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.099 
literally just going to pick up and on
the<00:02:50.310> weapon<00:02:50.639> actually<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.659> did<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
the weapon actually just like I did in

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.539 
the weapon actually just like I did in
this<00:02:52.200> gameplay<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> fire<00:02:53.159> except<00:02:53.430> it's

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
this gameplay then the fire except it's

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.250 
this gameplay then the fire except it's
not<00:02:53.639> something<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.239> will<00:02:54.389> need<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:55.139> in

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
not something that you will need and in

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.929 
not something that you will need and in
that<00:02:55.439> case<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.889> would<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:56.159> recommend<00:02:56.639> you

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
that case I would actually recommend you

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:58.909 
that case I would actually recommend you
to<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.239> for<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.540> EMP<00:02:57.840> grenade<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.469> impunity

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
to go for the EMP grenade the impunity

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.709 
to go for the EMP grenade the impunity
goes<00:02:59.219> hand-in-hand<00:02:59.549> with<00:02:59.669> the<00:03:00.000> engineer<00:03:00.480> perk

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
goes hand-in-hand with the engineer perk

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.899 
goes hand-in-hand with the engineer perk
and<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.500> give<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.889> ton<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.370> experience

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
and will give you a ton of experience

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.940 
and will give you a ton of experience
points<00:03:03.239> anyway<00:03:03.959> my<00:03:04.079> first<00:03:04.319> perk<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.799> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
points anyway my first perk is the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.319 
points anyway my first perk is the
lightweight<00:03:05.159> now<00:03:05.489> lightweight<00:03:05.909> first<00:03:06.180> I'll

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
lightweight now lightweight first I'll

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.970 
lightweight now lightweight first I'll
get<00:03:06.510> rid<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.810> any<00:03:07.049> fall<00:03:07.349> damage<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.889> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
get rid of any fall damage that you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.949 
get rid of any fall damage that you
would<00:03:08.099> usually<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.639> without<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.239> perk<00:03:09.450> but

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
would usually get without the perk but

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.539 
would usually get without the perk but
the<00:03:10.109> main<00:03:10.260> reason<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:10.680> actually<00:03:10.859> using<00:03:11.189> it<00:03:11.430> is

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
the main reason I'm actually using it is

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.309 
the main reason I'm actually using it is
because<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.000> increases<00:03:12.120> movement<00:03:12.930> speed<00:03:13.139> by

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
because it increases movement speed by

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.550 
because it increases movement speed by
7%<00:03:13.939> after<00:03:14.939> some<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.329> 7%<00:03:15.930> might<00:03:16.139> not<00:03:16.319> seem

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
7% after some of you 7% might not seem

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
7% after some of you 7% might not seem
like<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.769> lot<00:03:17.069> but<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:17.340> you're<00:03:17.489> using<00:03:17.699> it<00:03:17.940> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
like a lot but when you're using it you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.520 
like a lot but when you're using it you
will<00:03:18.209> definitely<00:03:18.449> notice<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.049> difference

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
will definitely notice a difference

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.619 
will definitely notice a difference
between<00:03:19.709> are<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.129> using<00:03:20.310> lightweight<00:03:20.639> or<00:03:21.060> not

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
between are you using lightweight or not

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.599 
between are you using lightweight or not
using<00:03:21.840> lightweight<00:03:22.199> anyway<00:03:23.040> at<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> start<00:03:23.549> of

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
using lightweight anyway at the start of

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.189 
using lightweight anyway at the start of
this<00:03:23.699> video<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.030> said<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.659> this<00:03:24.810> gun<00:03:25.049> you

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
this video I said that with this gun you

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.229 
this video I said that with this gun you
want<00:03:25.409> to<00:03:25.560> make<00:03:25.709> sure<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.519> get<00:03:26.669> as<00:03:26.819> close<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
want to make sure you get as close to

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.819 
want to make sure you get as close to
your<00:03:27.329> enemies<00:03:27.629> as<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.959> possibly<00:03:28.349> can<00:03:28.620> and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
your enemies as you possibly can and

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.649 
your enemies as you possibly can and
lightweight<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.669> simply<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> help<00:03:30.510> you

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
lightweight is simply going to help you

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.509 
lightweight is simply going to help you
do<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.049> little<00:03:31.590> bit<00:03:31.709> faster<00:03:31.979> so<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.400> is

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
do that a little bit faster so that is

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.490 
do that a little bit faster so that is
why<00:03:32.639> I<00:03:32.669> use<00:03:32.879> them<00:03:33.180> now<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.720> scavenger<00:03:34.290> not

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
why I use them now you scavenger not

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.140 
why I use them now you scavenger not
because<00:03:34.919> I<00:03:34.949> feel<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.609> I'm<00:03:35.760> going<00:03:35.939> to<00:03:36.060> be

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
because I feel like I'm going to be

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.759 
because I feel like I'm going to be
running<00:03:36.359> out<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.569> ammo<00:03:36.780> with<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.109> m1216

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
running out of ammo with the m1216

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.379 
running out of ammo with the m1216
because<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.310> usually<00:03:38.639> don't<00:03:38.909> really<00:03:39.209> run<00:03:39.329> out

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
because I usually don't really run out

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.030 
because I usually don't really run out
of<00:03:39.510> ammo<00:03:39.689> with<00:03:39.870> these<00:03:40.019> shotguns<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:40.709> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
of ammo with these shotguns but I

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.530 
of ammo with these shotguns but I
actually<00:03:41.189> use<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.699> just<00:03:41.879> to<00:03:42.030> make<00:03:42.180> sure<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.479> I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
actually use it just to make sure that I

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.360 
actually use it just to make sure that I
can<00:03:42.750> get<00:03:42.900> my<00:03:43.019> c4<00:03:43.229> over<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:43.949> over<00:03:44.159> and<00:03:44.310> over

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
can get my c4 over and over and over

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.939 
can get my c4 over and over and over
again<00:03:44.609> after<00:03:45.359> usually<00:03:45.509> for<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> ton<00:03:46.530> lately
