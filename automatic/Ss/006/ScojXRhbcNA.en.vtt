underneath that combination though

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.649 
underneath that combination though
because<00:01:51.609> this<00:01:51.789> is<00:01:51.999> more<00:01:52.299> of<00:01:52.359> a<00:01:52.450> yellow

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
because this is more of a yellow

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.529 
because this is more of a yellow
undertone<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.169> this<00:01:53.529> is<00:01:53.679> more<00:01:53.919> of<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.539> purple

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
undertone and this is more of a purple

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.449 
undertone and this is more of a purple
so<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.049> like<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.409> use<00:01:56.590> my<00:01:56.649> Urban<00:01:57.009> Decay<00:01:57.039> under
