00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.360
 Hello friends in the name, she is from 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.200
 bonsai say today I chose a theme too 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.639
 very interesting, I'll talk about 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.639
 to choose 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.590
 we know that bonsai which is composed of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.600
 four pages 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:33.350
 we can say lead and trunk 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.210
 the structure of primary expenditures and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.380
 because he chose the front because the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.520
 front has to be a side what you see 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:51.830
 the bonsai yet you see all these 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.620
 four matches and sometimes when the good 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:01:00.530
 site made yesterday can be a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.879
 closed scar 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.240
 So you hide behind your back in the 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.350
 You can not see the 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.790
 leaders hide their weaknesses 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.760
 so I 'll cite five points that will 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:33.729
 help us choose the front first 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:38.390
 better view of the baby will lead to 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:42.950
 reasonable but when you take it you see 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.780
 this shortage is lacking and more 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.850
 certainly this root you guided in a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:02:00.469
 moment of planting the seedling it is 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:04.280
 back and know if it went well but ahead 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:08.229
 you 're going to hide it a little 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.229
 defect then it would 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:19.450
 then better view of the second snowfall 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:22.939
 best view of the cone town of tron 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.329
 teams in need of exchange is 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.459
 when it starts grossi is tuning 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.739
 gradually as it approaches the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.250
 after 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.920
 so let's look at this plant 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:42.470
 balance the amount of 11 you get to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:51.170
 people observe is like this is practically the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:54.319
 same years of remarkable age 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.010
 front could not be that what you 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.849
 I would be seeing this remarkable community 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.500
 I said first better vision nor will it 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.370
 second best view of the tron ​​community 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.930
 is now the 3rd best view of the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.980
 tron 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.090
 so if you have to have a curve in the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.430
 trunk 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.669
 if you look for example you have this 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:27.500
 Curl you are not seeing the cogitá you 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:30.639
 can see this curve is better vision 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.629
 of the trump movement 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:40.910
 now the better view of the structure of 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:43.220
 twigs closed 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.299
 You can not see the cocks there. 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.120
 inside 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.239
 so it's practically a topiary is 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:57.709
 because we have to get these four 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:04:00.889
 parts that is bali trunk better vision 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.370
 of the cost reduction must be seen in the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.340
 front 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.920
 your website and lastly a better view 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.860
 dead wood, right? 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.510
 we are seeing here that simon leaves us 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.760
 30 on the ground 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.180
 it is not advisable to justify 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.760
 pointing to you because you are 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 almost imperceptible 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.260
 So I both feel so much charm and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.990
 wall should be seen in profile is sometimes 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.520
 you have to have a motorcycle so much 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.669
 big the trunk pull for you you only 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.729
 It's good in the dead part. 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.389
 The interesting thing is you see the dead part 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.460
 and also below life and the one is 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.150
 It is interesting that gold is not 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
 a different service because you have the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.900
 bottom 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.780
 sometimes when you put it profile 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.270
 you have a sense of depth 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.100
 so when you have a wood shows 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.520
 show everything should turn around 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.660
 that way death then ahead of 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:17.990
 your good site is to have a vision 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:26.440
 better this way, like rice 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:32.349
 He represents the family of his sister as 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:36.199
 Father can teach us to choose the front 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:39.070
 we are like the works we have to 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:48.800
 our front of our figurative back 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:51.470
 would our backs would be everyone 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.289
 want to put ahead of the side you see 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:01.610
 the best part of our trend is 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:05.960
 look at people only the defects have 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.090
 many qualities that outweigh the 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.810
 of them performance 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.080
 I live, so let's now look at the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.780
 people also look for the 5th look at the 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.770
 qualities of people who often 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.710
 get over your hands it's a touch I wanted 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.290
 pass on to you about power ahead 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.919
 I hope you have enjoyed it very much. 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.919
 thank you
