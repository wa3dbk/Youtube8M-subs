00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
again I don't know if it was the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.300 
again I don't know if it was the
pressure<00:03:04.780> or<00:03:05.050> what<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.470> but<00:03:06.040> nonetheless

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
going to win but I think it's going to

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.440 
going to win but I think it's going to
be<00:07:01.770> close<00:07:02.070> I<00:07:02.370> think<00:07:03.060> it's<00:07:03.150> going<00:07:03.240> to<00:07:03.330> happen

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:03.450 
be close I think it's going to happen

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.790 
be close I think it's going to happen
when<00:07:03.690> that<00:07:03.870> nag<00:07:04.080> ease<00:07:04.230> the<00:07:04.350> Luck's<00:07:04.560> going<00:07:04.740> to

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
when that nag ease the Luck's going to

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.040 
when that nag ease the Luck's going to
run<00:07:04.860> out<00:07:05.010> he's<00:07:05.700> going<00:07:06.060> to<00:07:06.210> finally<00:07:06.720> start

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
run out he's going to finally start

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.600 
run out he's going to finally start
again<00:07:07.500> if<00:07:07.620> they<00:07:07.770> do<00:07:07.830> lose<00:07:08.190> its<00:07:08.400> going<00:07:08.550> to

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
again if they do lose its going to

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.070 
again if they do lose its going to

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
because Matt negi feels the pressure

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.690 
because Matt negi feels the pressure
Columbus<00:07:10.890> feels<00:07:11.100> the<00:07:11.220> pressure<00:07:11.400> and<00:07:11.640> they

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
Columbus feels the pressure and they

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.120 
Columbus feels the pressure and they

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
up I think it's just gonna be a matter

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.810 
up I think it's just gonna be a matter
of<00:07:19.200> them<00:07:19.410> being<00:07:19.680> there<00:07:19.920> been<00:07:20.370> there<00:07:20.520> done<00:07:20.790> that

of them being there been there done that

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.400 
of them being there been there done that
kind<00:07:21.180> of<00:07:21.300> thing<00:07:21.540> they're<00:07:21.930> not<00:07:22.050> going<00:07:22.200> to<00:07:22.290> make

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
kind of thing they're not going to make

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.590 
kind of thing they're not going to make
the<00:07:22.470> jittery<00:07:23.250> first<00:07:23.610> quarter<00:07:23.910> mistakes<00:07:24.330> and<00:07:24.540> I

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
the jittery first quarter mistakes and I

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.670 
the jittery first quarter mistakes and I
think<00:07:24.780> they're<00:07:24.870> going<00:07:24.960> to<00:07:25.020> be<00:07:25.170> their<00:07:25.290> toes<00:07:25.500> in

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
think they're going to be their toes in

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.410 
think they're going to be their toes in
on<00:07:25.860> the<00:07:25.920> fourth<00:07:26.130> quarter<00:07:26.370> and<00:07:26.880> I<00:07:26.970> think<00:07:27.180> San

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
on the fourth quarter and I think San

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.510 
on the fourth quarter and I think San
Jose<00:07:27.810> is<00:07:28.020> going<00:07:28.500> to<00:07:28.620> pull<00:07:28.800> it<00:07:28.830> out<00:07:29.010> but<00:07:29.220> again
