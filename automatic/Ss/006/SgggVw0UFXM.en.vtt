heat up when used in sunlight I often

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.969 
heat up when used in sunlight I often
like<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:57.149> my<00:01:57.420> iPad<00:01:57.840> outdoors<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.740> when

like to take my iPad outdoors and when

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340 
like to take my iPad outdoors and when

I'm in the Sun the gen 1 iPad would

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
I'm in the Sun the gen 1 iPad would

often overheat and shut down making it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.080 
often overheat and shut down making it
entirely<00:02:04.380> useless<00:02:04.710> however<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> white

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
entirely useless however with a white

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 
entirely useless however with a white
bezel<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:07.140> mitigate<00:02:07.590> glare<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.099> overheating

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
bezel to mitigate glare and overheating

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.210 
bezel to mitigate glare and overheating
this<00:02:08.970> might<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.780> best<00:02:10.050> ipad<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.800> outdoor

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
this might be the best ipad for outdoor

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
this might be the best ipad for outdoor
use<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> end<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> could<00:02:12.510> argue

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
use in the end I think you could argue

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730 
use in the end I think you could argue
the<00:02:13.080> case<00:02:13.260> for

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
the case for

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.370 
the case for
either<00:02:13.890> color<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.330> me<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.570> wine<00:02:15.720> iPad<00:02:16.170> is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
either color but for me the wine iPad is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.020 
either color but for me the wine iPad is
unique<00:02:16.710> attractive<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.520> functionally

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
unique attractive and functionally

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.600 
unique attractive and functionally
superior<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> black<00:02:19.230> iPad<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> I

superior to the black iPad so for that I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.030 
superior to the black iPad so for that I
can<00:02:21.090> wholeheartedly<00:02:21.330> recommend<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.770> white

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
