00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
remember in fifth grade we did a

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.250 
remember in fifth grade we did a
week-long<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.470> little<00:02:51.100> study<00:02:51.430> session<00:02:51.880> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
week-long a little study session of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.050 
week-long a little study session of
geography<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.590> united<00:02:53.920> states<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.310> 13

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
geography in the united states and 13

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.300 
geography in the united states and 13
colonies<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.510> all<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.750> crap<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.200> there<00:02:57.160> was

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
colonies and all that crap and there was

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.010 
colonies and all that crap and there was
this<00:02:57.459> song<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.239> they<00:02:58.330> played<00:02:58.540> once<00:02:58.780> or<00:02:58.930> twice

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
this song that they played once or twice

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.520 
this song that they played once or twice
that<00:02:59.470> had<00:02:59.920> all<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.610> 50<00:03:01.270> states<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.140> think

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
that had all of the 50 states so I think

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.930 
that had all of the 50 states so I think
that<00:03:02.739> might<00:03:02.890> be<00:03:02.950> where<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.280> picked<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.640> up<00:03:03.730> but

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
that might be where I picked it up but

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.820 
that might be where I picked it up but
I'm<00:03:04.060> not<00:03:04.209> quite<00:03:04.390> sure<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:05.320> gonna<00:03:05.440> do<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
I'm not quite sure so I'm gonna do that
