00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.630
 hey people i am timo wermeyer of 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.259
 skateboards today there is new tutorial 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.129
 and that slideshow with my setup is 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:22.430
 the committee summer with 44 recognizable 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:25.010
 trucks about the release and scripts so 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.750
 now comes the sixth position 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.510
 do you imagine already like a 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.090
 new way sets the mark and with the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.780
 I am therefore the rear foot 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.300
 left behind with me a little further 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.750
 about it so he just build up pressure 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.750
 So can the change slideshow with 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.420
 you need the normal backside 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.570
 boardslide and the only thing you do 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 If there is a little kick here, if so 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 you just feel sorry for us 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.590
 this turns it on and if it does 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.450
 has turned so far that is again 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.269
 then just down the hill rolls 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.960
 just jump back and that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.960
 It was a shot 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:14.259
 so now comes the french jobs 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:18.039
 like a normal frontside 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.710
 boardslide and maybe one behind 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.179
 a bit further at all with the heel 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.179
 so that you can fill it again 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:28.350
 pressure can build up for frontex step 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.850
 Do you have the numbers despite politicians 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.289
 just like the bag since the way 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.329
 just with the back foot one 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.219
 little kick 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.789
 that's why I'm turning that and yahoo will 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.799
 to land on it again 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.340
 Here must try that you the deck 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.689
 that's about as far as it expresses 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.090
 it will probably end up on it again 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.670
 and then you end up with that 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.819
 First foot first and pull the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.979
 back and here tastes best 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.659
 to end up where I will please stand 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.799
 if not it is not bad either 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.750
 just put it back like that 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.710
 down 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 the only thing you are actually wrong 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.050
 that is too much or too much for her 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 so little out puts that that covers 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 either too far or too long 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.580
 little so you will not be back 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.780
 can reasonably land on it and then 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.200
 just not just go down the mountain 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.920
 can 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.840
 I hope we did not help 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.600
 if that is so then gives the thumb 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.600
 go up and subscribe said
