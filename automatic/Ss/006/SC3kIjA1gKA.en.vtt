 Hello! 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.310
 I offer a recipe for very tasty, soft and airy 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.379
 cupcakes with bananas. 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.940
 We will need: two ripe bananas, 100 g of butter, a glass 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.310
 sugar, two eggs, two teaspoons of baking powder, two 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.410
 cups of flour. 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.879
 Bananas peel, chop, knead the pulp. Important 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 use ripe bananas that are easily crumpled. 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:58.470
 Grind butter with sugar and beat. Add eggs 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:14.280
 and beat. Add baking powder to the sifted flour. Add 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.400
 flour and bananas. We beat them up so that the mass is airy. Dough 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:39.520
 lay out in oiled molds, set 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.450
 in the oven heated to 180 degrees for 15-20 minutes. 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.880
 Cool the ready-made muffins and sprinkle with powdered sugar. 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.780
 appetite!
