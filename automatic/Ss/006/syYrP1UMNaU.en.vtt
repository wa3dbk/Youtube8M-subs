00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.179 
bike works so I've spawned some items to
basically<00:00:22.199> go<00:00:22.380> through<00:00:22.560> how<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.800> works<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
first you can find the mini bike for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.040 
first you can find the mini bike for
dumb<00:00:25.529> shits<00:00:25.859> ok<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.359> pretty<00:00:27.570> funny<00:00:27.810> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

you read that and that's gonna make the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.760 
you read that and that's gonna make the
mini<00:00:33.300> bike<00:00:33.510> chassis<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.140> all<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.380> stuff<00:00:34.530> pop

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
mini bike chassis and all that stuff pop

it to make the chassis it takes bars
iron<00:00:50.969> bars<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> SI<00:00:51.989> likes<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
iron bars to make the SI likes that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
iron bars to make the SI likes that
takes<00:00:52.590> cotton<00:00:53.430> short<00:00:54.120> iron<00:00:54.270> pipes

going to spawn in the handlebars really
quick<00:01:25.159> responds<00:01:26.159> better<00:01:26.490> chassis<00:01:27.000> anyways

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
quick responds better chassis anyways

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.560 
quick responds better chassis anyways
and<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.390> read

the book it has a little icon above it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.969 
the book it has a little icon above it
so<00:01:32.909> ok<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.500> got<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> chassis

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so ok so now that you got the chassis

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.410 
so ok so now that you got the chassis
you're<00:01:35.729> gonna<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.479> need<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.740> forgot<00:01:38.100> a

damage it does to zombies I'm assuming

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.719

and I haven't tested it just yet I'm

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.679 
and I haven't tested it just yet I'm
sure<00:06:02.930> I<00:06:03.200> could<00:06:03.349> spawn<00:06:03.650> something<00:06:03.979> but
