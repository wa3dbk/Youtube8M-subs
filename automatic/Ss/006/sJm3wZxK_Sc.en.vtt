okay<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:53.030> primary<00:03:53.270> function<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.870> because

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
okay the primary function that because

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.840 
okay the primary function that because
he<00:03:54.530> has<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.860> game<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.250> she<00:03:55.400> carries<00:03:55.700> this

he has in the game and she carries this
wrench<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> wrench<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.410> used<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:57.770> many

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
wrench and the wrench is used for many

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.170 
wrench and the wrench is used for many
different<00:03:58.010> things<00:03:58.340> one<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.820> things<00:03:59.030> that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
different things one of the things that

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.600 
different things one of the things that
the<00:03:59.270> wrench<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.570> used<00:03:59.720> for<00:03:59.870> us<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.110> turn<00:04:00.350> these

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
the wrench is used for us to turn these

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.800 
the wrench is used for us to turn these
devices<00:04:01.610> so<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.000> basically<00:04:02.150> grab<00:04:02.540> with<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
devices so you basically grab with the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.110 
devices so you basically grab with the
wrench<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.380> then<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.250> twist<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:04.730> controller

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
wrench and then you twist the controller

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.840 
wrench and then you twist the controller
around<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.840> it'll<00:04:06.350> move<00:04:07.220> different<00:04:07.700> things

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
around and it'll move different things

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.780 
around and it'll move different things
in<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> game<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.330> i'll<00:04:08.390> shake<00:04:08.630> my<00:04:08.810> box<00:04:09.020> free

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
in the game so i'll shake my box free

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.460 
in the game so i'll shake my box free

like what you'll do today to collect
jiggies<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.370> don't<00:04:34.580> just<00:04:34.790> get<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.930> GE<00:04:36.110> you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
jiggies you don't just get the GE you

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.880 
jiggies you don't just get the GE you
get<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.370> jiggy<00:04:37.700> out<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.600> game<00:04:38.930> world<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.500> put

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890

get the jiggy out of game world and put
into<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.430> jiggy<00:04:40.700> dispenser<00:04:41.150> at<00:04:41.480> first<00:04:42.050> it's

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
into the jiggy dispenser at first it's

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.080 
into the jiggy dispenser at first it's
simple<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.830> just<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.340> come<00:04:43.460> over<00:04:43.640> here<00:04:43.700> I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
carry it over to that and it sticks the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.810 
carry it over to that and it sticks the
jiggies<00:04:54.080> up<00:04:54.260> into<00:04:54.560> this<00:04:54.680> device<00:04:55.190> this<00:04:55.640> is

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
jiggies up into this device this is

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.820 
jiggies up into this device this is
showing<00:04:56.000> 100<00:04:56.510> because<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.229> cheated<00:04:57.530> my<00:04:57.800> way

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
showing 100 because I cheated my way

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.370 
showing 100 because I cheated my way
right<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.180> just<00:04:59.479> carry<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.960> jiggy<00:05:00.200> here

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
right so you just carry the jiggy here

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.159 
right so you just carry the jiggy here
and<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.560> floats<00:05:00.860> up<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.360> number<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.780> jiggy's

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
and it floats up the number of jiggy's

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.930 
and it floats up the number of jiggy's
you<00:05:03.350> have<00:05:03.560> determines<00:05:04.400> which<00:05:04.520> one<00:05:04.760> of<00:05:04.790> these

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
you have determines which one of these

you have determines which one of these
doors<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:06.500> doors<00:05:06.530> that<00:05:06.919> are<00:05:06.950> LUP<00:05:07.190> see<00:05:07.490> there's

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
doors the doors that are LUP see there's

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.300 
doors the doors that are LUP see there's
one<00:05:07.700> right<00:05:07.910> there<00:05:07.970> there's<00:05:08.720> one<00:05:08.780> over<00:05:08.990> there

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
one right there there's one over there

one right there there's one over there
those<00:05:10.310> have<00:05:10.490> jiggy<00:05:10.910> requirements<00:05:11.570> kind<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
those have jiggy requirements kind of

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.530 
those have jiggy requirements kind of
like<00:05:11.960> banjo<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.530> banjo<00:05:12.860> tooie<00:05:13.040> so<00:05:13.880> your<00:05:14.330> very
