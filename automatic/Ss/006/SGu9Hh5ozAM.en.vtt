life<00:00:31.329> plus<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:31.779> we<00:00:32.020> can<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:33.430> 1000<00:00:34.270> charge

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.780 
life plus so we can do 1000 charge
cycles<00:00:34.930> so<00:00:35.680> i<00:00:35.710> think<00:00:35.829> that's<00:00:36.100> possible<00:00:36.310> with

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
cycles so i think that's possible with

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.509 
cycles so i think that's possible with
like<00:00:37.090> every<00:00:37.720> battery<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.530> world<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:39.430> we

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
like every battery in the world and we

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.939 
like every battery in the world and we
also<00:00:39.760> have<00:00:39.910> a<00:00:40.079> locking<00:00:41.079> system<00:00:41.500> with<00:00:41.620> keyboard

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
also have a locking system with keyboard

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
nice so a quick look around the device

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.240

we<00:02:05.069> have<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> front<00:02:05.609> camera<00:02:05.880> over<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:07.250> there's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
we have a front camera over here there's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.880 
we have a front camera over here there's
a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.459> button<00:02:09.560> they<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.799> switch<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> apps

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
