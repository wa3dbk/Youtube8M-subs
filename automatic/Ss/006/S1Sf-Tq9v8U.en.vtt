00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.040
 Hello, how are we back? 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.770
 again to the isopixel channel in this 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.509
 occasion for a small tutorial a 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:21.710
 hanson how ssd speakers work 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:23.860
 they are wireless and with a very 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.189
 nice it's a horn 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.790
 wireless of plus or minus 6 centimeters 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.790
 per side 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.210
 at the top we can find 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.120
 the power button the button 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.520
 volume up volume down and an icon 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 of phone that works like hands 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.020
 free through this speaker we're going to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.420
 to be able to receive calls also through 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.520
 of an integrated microphone when a 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.430
 call between our cell phone 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.230
 the audio is going to stop and we will be able to 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.079
 answer like that is that there is no 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:02.920
 problem why at the bottom 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.920
 of our horn we will find 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.570
 some slots also some spaces 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.790
 first we have the micro usb slot for 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.890
 to be able to charge our horn too 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.110
 we have an auxiliary cable input 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.470
 so we can also connect there 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.460
 some device a reset button and a 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.970
 button 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.670
 here is the space for a strap 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.800
 gel so we can take it to all 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.090
 sides already properly that's all the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.550
 truth is that it does not have much science 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.009
 then we will find what it is 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.970
 properly the speakers the speakers 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.360
 It has three exits and its operation 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.700
 it's very very very simple let's match 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.550
 the right now with a phone or with me 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.780
 cell phone so they see how how 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.630
 it works and really this so that you see 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.920
 that has no greater science first 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.830
 what are we going to do is 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.159
 to turn on our bluetooth I have it 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.000
 usually off for questions 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.690
 of security 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.620
 and once this is on 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.440
 we are also going to light our kitchen 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.360
 they heard that sound that tells us that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.220
 the horn is already on as well as 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 that lights a light down here 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.709
 good once the phone and the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.709
 horn are found 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.239
 it automatically connects you are already 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.890
 matched now yes what are we going to 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.280
 do is go to our application of 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.230
 favorite audio here I already have youtube 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.019
 in a song that I like 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.390
 and yet I love you joaquin 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.390
 sabina and we're going to put it 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.609
 there you hear 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.760
 let's lower the volume 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.760
 now we are going to increase the volume 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.160
 but baby 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.530
 there we can hear the song 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.510
 well let's lower it a bit to 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.170
 keep commenting on about the envelope 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.050
 the speaker let the audio in a volume 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.070
 acceptable where you can listen to it 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.070
 let me hear my voice 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.290
 as you can see it is a horn 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.599
 wireless if you as I appreciate 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.329
 very few wires in your space 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.870
 really work this office can be 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.770
 a very good option we are going to put you 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.000
 stop 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.640
 on the phone so it does not make us bigger 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.640
 noise and focus on our speaker 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.530
 I told them that it is wireless and I 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 I love it because I hate having cables in 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.890
 the office 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.260
 and the design looks really good the truth 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.860
 is that this looks pretty good in 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.000
 any space and finally what 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.490
 The only thing I have to tell you is that if 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.040
 you have to find a dog to this 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.250
 office is your cost that goes from 1,100 to 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.170
 1,400 pesos depending on the store there 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.630
 have to play a little and look for the best 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.430
 offer and the second one is that we do not have 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.680
 way to know the load of the speaker if 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.230
 is that we will have to be loading them 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.810
 recurrently so that we do not go to 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.870
 leave without power so we are 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.690
 transporting well then that's all with 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.980
 regarding this srx horn this rs x 11 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.560
 of are and the truth is that the 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.640
 nomenclature does not help much remember 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.460
 which is 10 watts has a one output 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.030
 very interesting audio measures 6 x 6 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.210
 centimeters is wireless and gives us 12 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.610
 hours of autonomy with full load 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.720
 until next time with this hanson we 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.720
 we see on the next occasion
