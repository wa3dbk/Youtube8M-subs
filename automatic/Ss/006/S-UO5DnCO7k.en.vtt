 the first day and open only to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 Press was not open to the public I 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.440
 brought a quick video with 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.140
 some recordings that I did there from the fair 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.780

 recording audio in more detail. 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.850
 not very good due to i to noise 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 to the sound it's rolling music so I preferred 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.799
 remove the original audio from the video leaves 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.830
