00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
something like that and I didn't watch

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
ya so volatile player kelly actually had

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.060 
ya so volatile player kelly actually had
a<00:04:40.780> really<00:04:40.840> good<00:04:41.170> point<00:04:41.350> last<00:04:41.620> night<00:04:41.770> on<00:04:41.980> the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
a really good point last night on the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.280 
a really good point last night on the
stream<00:04:42.310> when<00:04:42.490> she<00:04:42.610> said<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.270> builds<00:04:44.170> and

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
stream when she said that the builds and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.930 
stream when she said that the builds and
things<00:04:44.320> don't<00:04:44.920> laugh<00:04:45.100> at<00:04:45.250> that<00:04:45.400> I'm<00:04:45.520> serious

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
things don't laugh at that I'm serious

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.670 
things don't laugh at that I'm serious
she<00:04:46.150> she<00:04:46.510> said<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.900> builds<00:04:47.230> and<00:04:47.350> everything

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
she she said the builds and everything

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.140 
she she said the builds and everything
that<00:04:47.740> they<00:04:47.890> see<00:04:47.950> in<00:04:48.190> code<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.520> are<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:48.940> much<00:04:49.120> more

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
that they see in code a are so much more

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.930 
that they see in code a are so much more
unique<00:04:49.720> than<00:04:50.320> code<00:04:51.190> s<00:04:51.340> where<00:04:51.550> everything<00:04:51.820> is

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
unique than code s where everything is

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.780 
unique than code s where everything is
kind<00:04:52.060> of<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.300> same<00:04:52.540> all<00:04:53.200> around<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:54.640> I<00:04:54.730> think

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
kind of the same all around and I think

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.100 
kind of the same all around and I think
that<00:04:54.940> really<00:04:55.090> has<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.480> lot<00:04:55.570> of<00:04:55.690> truth<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:55.960> it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
that really has a lot of truth to it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.360 
that really has a lot of truth to it
because<00:04:56.290> last<00:04:56.440> night<00:04:56.560> we<00:04:56.770> saw<00:04:56.920> some<00:04:57.130> stuff

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
because last night we saw some stuff

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.910 
because last night we saw some stuff
that<00:04:57.450> probably<00:04:58.450> isn't<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.750> best<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.440> people

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
that probably isn't the best but people

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.380 
that probably isn't the best but people
are<00:05:00.010> trying<00:05:00.250> more<00:05:00.610> things<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.180> it's<00:05:01.270> always

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
are trying more things and it's always

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.210 
are trying more things and it's always
good<00:05:01.600> to<00:05:01.630> see<00:05:01.810> kind<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.050> experimentation<00:05:02.620> in<00:05:03.100> a

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
good to see kind of experimentation in a

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.700 
good to see kind of experimentation in a
game<00:05:03.910> like<00:05:03.940> starcraft<00:05:04.510> ii<00:05:04.600> or<00:05:04.750> any<00:05:04.870> RTS<00:05:05.410> but

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
game like starcraft ii or any RTS but

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.060 
game like starcraft ii or any RTS but
speaking<00:05:06.490> of<00:05:06.670> code<00:05:07.060> s<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:08.350> about<00:05:08.650> i<00:05:09.010> think

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
speaking of code s and about i think

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.860 
speaking of code s and about i think
about<00:05:09.670> two<00:05:09.970> hours<00:05:10.120> from<00:05:10.270> now<00:05:10.450> maybe<00:05:10.600> an<00:05:10.780> hour

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
about two hours from now maybe an hour

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.450 
about two hours from now maybe an hour
and<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.050> half<00:05:11.170> from<00:05:11.290> now<00:05:11.380> they<00:05:12.190> are<00:05:12.280> going<00:05:12.400> to

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
and a half from now they are going to

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.060 
and a half from now they are going to
have<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.730> code<00:05:13.030> s<00:05:13.180> round<00:05:13.480> of<00:05:13.600> 32<00:05:13.720> day<00:05:14.230> 3<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.710> we

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
have the code s round of 32 day 3 and we

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.350 
have the code s round of 32 day 3 and we
have<00:05:15.190> one<00:05:15.400> group<00:05:15.640> left<00:05:15.670> it's<00:05:16.090> going<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.300> be

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
have one group left it's going to be

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.230 
have one group left it's going to be

Zenith first which if he doesn't win
that<00:05:23.430> he'll<00:05:24.430> probably<00:05:24.700> start<00:05:25.120> crying<00:05:25.210> on<00:05:25.690> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
that he'll probably start crying on the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.900 
that he'll probably start crying on the
6th<00:05:26.080> rahim<00:05:26.440> because<00:05:26.980> he<00:05:27.100> should<00:05:27.340> elderly

will<00:05:30.340> probably<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.670> pretty<00:05:30.790> good<00:05:30.910> TBT

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
will probably a pretty good TBT

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.480 
will probably a pretty good TBT
definitely<00:05:32.800> gonna<00:05:32.890> be<00:05:33.010> interesting<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> see

boxer and ensnare would probably get

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.640 
boxer and ensnare would probably get
some<00:05:37.420> good<00:05:37.570> games<00:05:37.750> from<00:05:37.870> that<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.290> tune<00:05:38.470> in<00:05:38.560> to

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
some good games from that so tune in to
