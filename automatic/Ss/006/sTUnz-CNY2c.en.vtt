00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.100
 to this dirtyh sector 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.470
 that's what's exciting 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.130
 at the palace November 17, 2010 welcome to the head of dried apples know 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.819
 that the paternal family 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.089
 so we can see if it is clear 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.219
 they are installed above the hand 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.560
 in fact the idea is to put apples contracts passed in the garden 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.699
 it has dried and thanks to the natural warmth of the hand is what the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.009
 report of return and if I can I will learn a lot how 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.690
 we prepare its forms so once we have selected them in custody that those 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.880
 who are fat enough who are not rotten 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.190
 thanks to this peace must report note of biotechnology 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.140
 we will have the center of the band removed, that is to say, I do not 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 worry we look 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.600
 see and 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 however how does the center 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.970
 but if I'm a substitute 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 we take the door and suddenly we have the same to hear 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.130
 so we try to do the same regular theme 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.460
 depending on the form of training will cross it's fine 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.850
 once we've done it's the same 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 we are here for a reminder around 7 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.180
 in the southwest yesterday that I cut 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.220
 I certainly have not perfect so now if you approach three 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.760
 strong heads 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 we fix 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 it's not on the side of the pudding and then up 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.350
 a thank you to the camera my mom 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 good actually I'm in good health it's okay to show 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730
 so I will set every morning 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.700
 harare master koffi koffi n'guessan 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.040
 we have to be able to think because I like having a distribution 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.350
 nearly homogeneous 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.359
 yet done 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.320
 each small slats 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.260
 and clear enough to dry a beach in the wrong way 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.300
 but it's more for the movie 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.820
 here is the reading we leave a beautiful perf in three chapters slices of 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.530
 apples 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 for this track to properly 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.680
 here but after about a week of drying for two thirds the apples 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.940
 dried
