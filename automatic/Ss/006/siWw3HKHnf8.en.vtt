00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
here and wanted to share some ideas with

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.310 
here and wanted to share some ideas with
you<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:11.969> some<00:00:12.000> white<00:00:12.330> sand<00:00:12.630> squats<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
you with some white sand squats a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
you with some white sand squats a
powerlifter<00:00:13.830> squat<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.700> one<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> things

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
powerlifter squat and one of the things

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.330 
powerlifter squat and one of the things
I<00:00:15.690> remember<00:00:16.080> from<00:00:16.320> dangreen<00:00:16.740> seminar<00:00:17.160> was

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
I remember from dangreen seminar was

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
I remember from dangreen seminar was
that<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.699> know<00:00:17.789> widening<00:00:18.300> your<00:00:18.510> stance<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.930> bit

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
that you know widening your stance a bit

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.810 
that you know widening your stance a bit
increases<00:00:19.770> your<00:00:19.949> leverage<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
increases your leverage because it

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
increases your leverage because it
reduces<00:00:21.119> your<00:00:21.390> range<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.689> motion<00:00:21.800> but<00:00:22.800> people

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
reduces your range of motion but people

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.750 
reduces your range of motion but people
lack<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> mobility<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:25.250> do<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> wide<00:00:26.519> stance

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
lack the mobility to do a wide stance

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
lack the mobility to do a wide stance

squat days my second squat day of the
week<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.080> gonna<00:00:31.230> mess<00:00:31.410> around<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:31.890> these

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
wide stance squats as you can see I'm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.650 
wide stance squats as you can see I'm
using<00:00:33.809> some<00:00:34.320> toe<00:00:35.100> shoes<00:00:35.430> Byron<00:00:35.940> Vibram

using some toe shoes Byron Vibram
FiveFingers<00:00:36.930> Vibram<00:00:37.739> shoes<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
FiveFingers Vibram shoes and it's a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
FiveFingers Vibram shoes and it's a
definitely<00:00:39.750> uncomfortable<00:00:40.079> position<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
definitely uncomfortable position of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.590 
definitely uncomfortable position of
being<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.340> advantage<00:00:41.879> though<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> wide

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
being one advantage though of this wide

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.970 
being one advantage though of this wide
stance<00:00:42.870> squat<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.710> really

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
stance squat is that if you have really

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.410 
stance squat is that if you have really
bad<00:00:44.100> ankle<00:00:44.489> mobility<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> way<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
bad ankle mobility it's a way to

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.900 
bad ankle mobility it's a way to
mitigate<00:00:45.690> ankle<00:00:46.500> mobility<00:00:46.730> meaning<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
mitigate ankle mobility meaning that you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
mitigate ankle mobility meaning that you
don't<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.450> dorsiflexion<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.190> also

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
don't need as much dorsiflexion you also

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.630 
don't need as much dorsiflexion you also
make<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.300> hit<00:00:51.449> parallel<00:00:51.930> exactly

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
make it so that you hit parallel exactly

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
make it so that you hit parallel exactly
here's<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:53.879> you'll<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.960> another<00:00:55.079> video

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
here's some you'll see in another video

I'm gonna have some some side views and
you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> look<00:00:58.530> at<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.370> can

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you can take a look at that and you can

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.650 
you can take a look at that and you can
tell<00:00:59.579> me<00:00:59.640> opinion<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.149> I'm<00:01:00.270> getting<00:01:00.449> low

tell me opinion if I'm getting low

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.100 
tell me opinion if I'm getting low
enough<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.640> powerlifters<00:01:03.110> powerlifting

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
meet because I think that sometimes I'm

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
meet because I think that sometimes I'm
not<00:01:05.549> getting<00:01:05.850> low<00:01:06.000> enough<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.560> feels

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
not getting low enough it just feels

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
not getting low enough it just feels
really<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.400> tight<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.510> gonna

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
really really tight and I'm just gonna

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.719 
really really tight and I'm just gonna
be<00:01:10.439> patient<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> time<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> learn

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
be patient and take the time to learn

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
be patient and take the time to learn
this<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.689> reasons<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.290> gonna

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this because two reasons one is gonna

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.990 
this because two reasons one is gonna
help<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:13.710> mobility<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.280> general<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
help my mobility in general so this is a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
help my mobility in general so this is a
way<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> stretch<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> improve<00:01:16.259> my

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
way to stretch and improve my

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
way to stretch and improve my
flexibility<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.240> other<00:01:18.450> things<00:01:18.780> maybe<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
flexibility for other things maybe if I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
flexibility for other things maybe if I
want<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> sumo<00:01:19.890> deadlift<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> future<00:01:21.080> but

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
want a sumo deadlift in the future but

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.560 
want a sumo deadlift in the future but
also<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.590> helps<00:01:22.890> allow<00:01:23.159> me<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> just

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
also it helps allow me to just

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
also it helps allow me to just
strengthen<00:01:24.990> my<00:01:25.140> adductors<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.680> shrink<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.310> my

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
strengthen my adductors and shrink in my

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
strengthen my adductors and shrink in my
external<00:01:26.880> rotators<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> lot<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
external rotators a lot more because I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.219 
external rotators a lot more because I
find<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.820> quads<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.479> work<00:01:30.659> nearly<00:01:30.930> as

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
find that my quads don't work nearly as

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.890 
find that my quads don't work nearly as
hard<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.220> knee<00:01:32.280> does<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.759> bother<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:33.689> at

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
hard and my knee does not bother me at

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.480 
hard and my knee does not bother me at
all<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.259> feels<00:01:34.710> ridiculously

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
all it just feels ridiculously

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
all it just feels ridiculously
uncomfortable<00:01:36.119> because<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.810> stiff<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
uncomfortable because I'm so stiff and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
uncomfortable because I'm so stiff and
very<00:01:37.590> tight<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.220> position<00:01:38.729> Here<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.600> am

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
very tight in this position Here I am

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.230 
very tight in this position Here I am
doing<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.079> box<00:01:40.320> squats<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.189> went<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> box

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889 
class because I was feeling really
basically<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> wuss<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.600> felt<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.869> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
basically like a wuss I felt like a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.410 
basically like a wuss I felt like a
 because<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.490> could<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.850> squat

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
 because I just could not squat

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.580 
 because I just could not squat
well<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.259> felt<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
well with this it just felt so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.389 
well with this it just felt so
uncomfortable

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
uncomfortable

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
uncomfortable
so<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> way<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.869> regress<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so this is a way to go regress the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
so this is a way to go regress the
movement<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.850> still<00:01:54.840> handle

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
movement so that way I can still handle

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.300 
movement so that way I can still handle
some<00:01:55.770> weight

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
some weight

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.609 
some weight
but<00:01:56.790> feel<00:01:57.000> confident<00:01:57.689> about<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:57.990> position<00:01:58.530> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
but feel confident about my position I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.310 
but feel confident about my position I
didn't<00:01:58.770> want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> lose<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.810> proper<00:02:00.810> posture<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
didn't want to lose my proper posture I

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
didn't want to lose my proper posture I
don't<00:02:01.500> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> irritate<00:02:02.130> anything<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
don't want to irritate anything and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.840 
don't want to irritate anything and
overall<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.200> feels<00:02:04.229> fairly<00:02:05.130> good<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.549> far<00:02:05.759> as

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
overall it feels fairly good as far as

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
overall it feels fairly good as far as
the<00:02:05.939> movement<00:02:06.149> meaning<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.380> doesn't<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the movement meaning that it doesn't I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.469 
the movement meaning that it doesn't I
don't<00:02:08.250> feel<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.489> my<00:02:08.610> knees<00:02:08.759> bothering<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
don't feel like my knees bothering me I

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
don't feel like my back is bothering me

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.309 
don't feel like my back is bothering me
I<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.910> feel<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.209> hips<00:02:12.540> are<00:02:12.750> frickin

Haight<00:02:13.469> and<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.829> totally<00:02:14.189> uncomfortable

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
Haight and it's totally uncomfortable

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.640 
Haight and it's totally uncomfortable
and<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.780> thing<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.959> understand<00:02:16.319> about<00:02:16.349> this

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and one thing to understand about this

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.020 
and one thing to understand about this
stance<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.159> that<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.459> squat<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:17.969> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
stance is that if you squat like this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
stance is that if you squat like this
and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.599> sumo<00:02:19.019> deadlift<00:02:19.409> I'm<00:02:19.920> pretty<00:02:20.310> sure

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and you sumo deadlift I'm pretty sure

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
and you sumo deadlift I'm pretty sure
you<00:02:20.549> can<00:02:20.700> tell<00:02:20.969> how<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.299> will<00:02:21.480> carry<00:02:21.840> over

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you can tell how this will carry over

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.020 
you can tell how this will carry over
into<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.499> sumo<00:02:22.950> deadlift<00:02:23.310> string<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:23.879> if<00:02:23.939> you

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
into a sumo deadlift string so if you

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.399 
into a sumo deadlift string so if you
can<00:02:24.180> squash<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.719> little<00:02:24.749> weight<00:02:25.049> like<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
can squash a little weight like this

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.739 
can squash a little weight like this
it's<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.400> carry<00:02:26.730> over<00:02:26.819> into<00:02:27.209> deadlift<00:02:27.659> and

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
it's gonna carry over into deadlift and

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.390 
it's gonna carry over into deadlift and
this<00:02:27.840> makes<00:02:28.019> me<00:02:28.079> understand<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.799> realize<00:02:28.950> why

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this makes me understand and realize why

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.879 
this makes me understand and realize why
people<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.780> Ben<00:02:30.989> rice<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.319> an<00:02:31.469> example<00:02:31.799> you

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
people like Ben rice as an example you

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.670 
people like Ben rice as an example you
see<00:02:32.040> him<00:02:32.189> squat<00:02:32.549> his<00:02:33.209> squat<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:33.900> his<00:02:34.200> deadlift

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
see him squat his squat and his deadlift

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.619 
see him squat his squat and his deadlift
stance<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.219> very<00:02:35.459> very<00:02:35.700> similar<00:02:35.939> a

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
stance is very very similar a

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.390 
stance is very very similar a
competition<00:02:37.500> style<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.950> same<00:02:38.099> thing<00:02:38.280> with

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
competition style the same thing with

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.129 
competition style the same thing with
Dan<00:02:38.519> greens<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.419> reason<00:02:39.659> why<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:40.049> don't

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
Dan greens and the reason why they don't

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.270 
Dan greens and the reason why they don't
have<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.349> deadlift<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.769> whole<00:02:40.919> lot<00:02:41.099> because

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
have to deadlift a whole lot because

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.520 
have to deadlift a whole lot because
they<00:02:41.909> do<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> lot<00:02:42.359> of<00:02:42.419> squatting<00:02:42.989> which<00:02:43.139> carries

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
they do a lot of squatting which carries

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.080 
they do a lot of squatting which carries
over<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:43.919> del<00:02:44.280> F<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.609> they<00:02:44.669> don't<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:44.969> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
over into del F and they don't have to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.720 
over into del F and they don't have to
spend<00:02:45.419> nearly<00:02:45.599> as<00:02:45.780> much<00:02:45.900> time<00:02:46.169> trying<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.730> work

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
spend nearly as much time trying to work

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.490 
spend nearly as much time trying to work
and<00:02:47.939> then<00:02:48.180> live<00:02:48.389> as<00:02:48.569> far<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:48.840> from<00:02:49.169> a<00:02:49.260> strength

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
and then live as far as from a strength

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.409 
and then live as far as from a strength
aspect<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> they<00:02:50.549> work<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.969> on<00:02:51.060> technique

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
aspect and they work more on technique

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.110 
aspect and they work more on technique
and<00:02:51.659> they<00:02:51.750> build<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.049> strength<00:02:52.349> from<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:53.000> squat

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and they build a strength from a squat

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.119 
and they build a strength from a squat
anyways<00:02:54.389> that's<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.719> my<00:02:54.870> opinion<00:02:55.010> like<00:02:56.010> you
