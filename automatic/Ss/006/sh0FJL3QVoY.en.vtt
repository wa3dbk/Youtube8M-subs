00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.870
 Hello, my young and not so 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.150
 padawans greet you on bright 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.440
 side with you vilsakoma is star wars 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.929
 knights of the old republic in 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.939
 there is not even an exclusive version for ipad 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.630
 Options for iphone pro android, I generally 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.520
 keep quiet 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.010
 I'd like to believe that this is the first but 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.470
 not the last fruit of love fighting mobile 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.470
 platforms I have been waiting for these ports for a long time 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.269
 whole hit pantry in end games pise 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.310
 90th of the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.510
 may the force be with a let's watch 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.550
 what is it? 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.550
 and whether it is possible to play at all flew 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.879
 discounts to all subscribers from a partner and 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.320
 apple store jizo.ru 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.269
 I love star wars and a universe 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 I love the old republic even more 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.949
 so I can be biased 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 which came out in 2003 won 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.440
 bafta event award is forty centuries 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.409
 before what we used to see in films 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.080
 agree a lot on the mechanics is old 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 old school hardcore if you want lpg in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 which nobody will be behind the handle 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 force jack in the ass and and ran to choose 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.960
 appearance classes look like me I 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
 was blunt- headed blonde imbecile though 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.990
 Who am I kidding 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.550
 a huge number of attributes of skills 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.170
 characteristics that you will need 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.880
 choose at the start and afterwards they 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 will affect including your 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 character that's all i'm like old 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.630
 oldschoolhack just adore but the most 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.630
 main star wars ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.900
 1 day after the release of the port on the ipad 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 conquered the first line again Russian 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.500
 appstore and not only Russian that 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.900
 I'm really very happy with the game 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.990
 noticeable your device is 2 and 3 gigabytes 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.890
 It costs 10 dollars or 329 rubles and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.410
 works on ipad 2 ipad mini lp 3 4 1 not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.060
 iphone ipod touch supported in general 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.800
 probably not stated correctly because 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 that on a small little screen would play 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 quite uncomfortable so what 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.810
 wonderful 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.970
 the port was very very very 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.570
 quality in general, like in general 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.120
 everything 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:21.890
 and the work is done very cool and here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.050
 at this place many will suffer bitterness and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.910
 disappointment only english 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.740
 there is no Russian localization but the language is here 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.900
 quite simple so you should all 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.580
 understand without any problems if you know 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.680
 level at least at a level slightly higher 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.110
 medium as for graphics a lot 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.010
 I heard that the graphics are a little awful 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 and ps version 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.270
 And this is for comparison the maximum 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.330
 write version settings yes better 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.770
 smoothing the lighting texture means 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.690
 society of the game you are so deep 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.820
 immerse yourself in the process that stops you 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.050
 worry how many triangles in 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.100
 the very place you are thinking about 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.570
 if with how the game looks 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.060
 really no questions no more 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.800
 that very very very decent 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.959
 performance even on ipad mini 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.400
 What can we say about the older brothers 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.700
 But with the mechanics with a huge amount 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.040
 menu and game features like on 1 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.750
 minus 40 gouging about this head and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.120
 I really faced with the fact that forced 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.670
 yourself to play at all through the knee but after 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.950
 how the whole story and twirled the plot 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.019
 even though it was probably well 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.120
 one and a half times exactly for light because 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.260
 dark here if such an opportunity 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.390
 you start getting general when you 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.610
 start studying lacquer 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.960
 and remember this feeling when 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.910
 come know nothing all 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.730
 annoying and then hop hop every 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.300
 corner familiar hello Sith patrol 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.150
 by the way? you bunch as you like best 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.740
 write in the comments and start after 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.770
 managed to remember some gaming 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.320
 elements including hero characters and 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.830
 I really remembered the plot but this is real 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.320
 the buzz 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.840
 of course you liked how 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.050
 adapted the interface under the ipad 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.060
 changed him a little bit and ? porting 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.550
 whether you need to refresh the interface elements 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.970
 because all the same game of 2003 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.640
 since then much water has passed and probably 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.400
 that's right although many will say it 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.080
 not the case should be all that's one hundred percent like 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.780
 it was then but again write to 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 comments your thoughts 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.630
 management is not certain but very 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.430
 comfortable i get a little accustomed and 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.320
 you can run around comfortably enough 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.020
 the game world is not here as such 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.460
 Defo yes where they clicked there and ran into 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.560
 timely computer could 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.960
 control mouse and keyboard 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.610
 and the game was ported to x-box and 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.770
 This is the abundance of options apparently 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
 allowed to implement on ipad 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.160
 as much as possible 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.080
 available comfortable option already m it 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.240
 so all other operations are done 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.760
 through huge piktogramki including 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.460
 on pause do not get need to try 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:58.640
 so the control on the mechanics of the game 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:05:00.380
 I almost could ipad and here I am 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.600
 I realized that talking about the game is no longer 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.970
 make no sense proven and 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.140
 proven time hit all 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.960
 times and peoples 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.330
 by many the favorite game with a very 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.220
 swirling plot interesting gaming 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.130
 Mechanics really you will not be bored 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.500
 march the tee through the Star Wars universe on 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.520
 The main thing is that on the ipad it lay as if 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.040
 here it was 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.140
 I'm waiting for the second one between jade empire and 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.540
 and so forth acts who factor 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.970
 which I already called can actually 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.310
 be ignorance of English but here 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.800
 what thing is today in 2013 you 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.440
 may have no idea what the moon is 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.850
 turns around the sun but English 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.850
 it is obligatory as air and lars 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.460
 but a little minuses where without them 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.800
 First of all, a huge number of screens 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.640
 boot again hello from the beginning 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.010
 two thousandths 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.620
 and the second point is not periodically 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.310
 always but saves beat 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.170
 sick theme of combat so do not forget 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.540
 create your own by the span of the game 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.550
