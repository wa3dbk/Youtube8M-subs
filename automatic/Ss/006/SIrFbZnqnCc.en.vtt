you<00:03:50.120> know<00:03:50.269> it's<00:03:50.480> just<00:03:50.630> not<00:03:50.810> growing<00:03:51.139> yet<00:03:51.410> but

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
you know it's just not growing yet but

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.800 
you know it's just not growing yet but
it<00:03:51.769> will<00:03:51.889> grow<00:03:52.100> so<00:03:52.639> three<00:03:53.030> four<00:03:53.239> months<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.630> not

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
it will grow so three four months is not

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.930 
it will grow so three four months is not
really<00:03:54.079> much<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.380> talk<00:03:54.709> about<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.340> know<00:03:55.459> but

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
really much to talk about you know but

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.220 
really much to talk about you know but
once<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:56.480> want<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.780> want<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> wait<00:03:57.109> to

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
once you want to you want to wait to

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.199 
once you want to you want to wait to
eight<00:03:57.380> months<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.889> about<00:03:58.220> ten<00:03:58.519> months<00:03:58.670> then<00:03:59.090> we

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
eight months to about ten months then we

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.000 
eight months to about ten months then we
have<00:03:59.329> things<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.630> talk<00:03:59.840> about<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:00.889> usually

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
have things to talk about so we usually

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.650 
have things to talk about so we usually
try<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.400> wait<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.760> eight<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.030> ten<00:04:02.209> months<00:04:02.359> to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
try to wait to eight to ten months to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.289 
try to wait to eight to ten months to
really<00:04:03.079> re-evaluate<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:04.579> know<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.030> success

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
really re-evaluate you know the success

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.500 
really re-evaluate you know the success
of<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.319> procedure<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.760> that's<00:04:07.970> that's<00:04:08.329> about

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
of the procedure so that's that's about

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.809 
of the procedure so that's that's about
it<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:08.989> know<00:04:09.079> we<00:04:09.230> have<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.410> laser<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.489> found

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
it you know we have a laser and I found

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.120 
it you know we have a laser and I found
that<00:04:11.090> red<00:04:11.450> light<00:04:11.660> lasers<00:04:12.200> effective<00:04:12.829> for

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
that red light lasers effective for

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.990 
that red light lasers effective for
healing<00:04:13.489> better<00:04:13.910> healing<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.599> stimuli

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
healing better healing and stimuli

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 
healing better healing and stimuli

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
every other day shouldn't use the laser

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.410 
every other day shouldn't use the laser
every<00:04:25.980> day<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:26.460> every<00:04:26.730> other<00:04:26.850> day<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.150> fine
