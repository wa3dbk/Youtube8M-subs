00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
know you can charge it up and fire it

know you can charge it up and fire it
does<00:00:32.640> use<00:00:32.910> two<00:00:33.239> shots<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> charge<00:00:34.079> rather

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
does use two shots on a charge rather

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
does use two shots on a charge rather
than<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> growl<00:00:35.520> spike<00:00:35.790> thrower<00:00:36.059> so

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
than one like the growl spike thrower so

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.209 
than one like the growl spike thrower so
it<00:00:36.510> makes<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> wise<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.989> only<00:00:37.410> use<00:00:37.890> charge

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it makes it wise to only use charge

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
it makes it wise to only use charge
shots<00:00:38.520> when<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.879> needed<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.600> they

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
shots when it's needed you know if they

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.610 
shots when it's needed you know if they
just<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.230> health<00:00:40.410> left

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
just have a little bit of health left

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
just have a little bit of health left
just<00:00:40.860> shoot<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.280> regular<00:00:41.460> shot<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
just shoot them with a regular shot it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
just shoot them with a regular shot it
also<00:00:42.780> means<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> only<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.800> one

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
also means that if you only have one

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
also means that if you only have one
shot<00:00:44.070> left<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> chamber<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.210> wise<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
shot left in the chamber it's wise to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
shot left in the chamber it's wise to
make<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> charge<00:00:46.440> shot<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> will

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
make it a charge shot because it will

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
make it a charge shot because it will
only<00:00:47.250> use<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.730> mo<00:00:48.059> regardless<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
only use one mo regardless and this is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
only use one mo regardless and this is
