it kind of what we thought it would be a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.880 
it kind of what we thought it would be a

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.560 
that saw some good things that it wasn't
all<00:01:23.799> bad<00:01:24.009> we<00:01:24.310> saw<00:01:24.490> some<00:01:24.520> good<00:01:24.909> things<00:01:25.149> but<00:01:25.330> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
all bad we saw some good things but the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
all bad we saw some good things but the
thing<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.409> wanted<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.770> see<00:01:26.979> was<00:01:27.250> 24

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
so we had a positive motivator just to

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.520 
so we had a positive motivator just to
help<00:01:34.149> them<00:01:34.390> remember<00:01:34.899> what<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.350> all<00:01:35.500> about

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530

think tight end wise were we're getting

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.460 
think tight end wise were we're getting
there<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.570> look<00:02:13.900> at<00:02:14.140> offensive

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
there and when you look at offensive

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.580 
there and when you look at offensive
line<00:02:14.859> I<00:02:14.890> think<00:02:15.190> our<00:02:15.870> first<00:02:16.870> couple<00:02:17.170> groups<00:02:17.350> are

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
line I think our first couple groups are

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.340 
line I think our first couple groups are
pretty<00:02:17.799> solid<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.329> young<00:02:19.570> kids<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.019> their

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
pretty solid the young kids that their

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.520 
pretty solid the young kids that their
heads<00:02:20.560> are<00:02:20.739> swimming<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:22.600> might<00:02:23.290> deal

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
heads are swimming and it might deal

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.500 
heads are swimming and it might deal
with<00:02:23.829> putting<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.489> probably<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.000> think<00:02:25.390> we

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
with putting in probably I think we

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.140 
with putting in probably I think we
probably<00:02:26.049> have<00:02:26.380> 15<00:02:27.280> plays<00:02:27.549> or<00:02:27.790> something<00:02:28.060> like

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
probably have 15 plays or something like

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.710 
probably have 15 plays or something like
that<00:02:28.209> but<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:31.299> part<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
that but it's a it's just part of the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.890 
that but it's a it's just part of the
process<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:33.700> easy<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:35.760> we'll<00:02:36.760> we'll<00:02:37.720> go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
process it's not easy but we'll we'll go

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
process it's not easy but we'll we'll go
for<00:02:38.410> tomorrow<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.640> two<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.380> second<00:02:41.769> one
