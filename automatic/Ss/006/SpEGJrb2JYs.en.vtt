these are the Thrasher's and the
Sparrow's<00:00:31.949> these<00:00:32.759> bikes<00:00:33.059> introduced<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.899> pedal

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Sparrow's these bikes introduced a pedal

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
Sparrow's these bikes introduced a pedal
into<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> equation<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> third<00:00:35.940> motor<00:00:36.210> skill

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
into the equation so a third motor skill

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
into the equation so a third motor skill
for<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> young<00:00:37.500> rider<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.950> learn<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> these<00:00:38.640> are

introduced yet another motor school into

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.500 
introduced yet another motor school into
the<00:00:56.760> equation

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the equation

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
the equation
while<00:00:57.960> these<00:00:58.140> bikes<00:00:58.350> still<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> coaster

while these bikes still have a coaster
brake<00:00:59.510> they<00:01:00.510> introduced<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.199> handbrake<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
brake they introduced the handbrake so

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
brake they introduced the handbrake so
now<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> young<00:01:02.730> rider<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.329> learning<00:01:03.899> how<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> use

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
now a young rider is learning how to use

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.859 
now a young rider is learning how to use
a<00:01:04.409> handbrake<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.339> stop<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> bicycle<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.810> we

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a handbrake to stop the bicycle now we

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
a handbrake to stop the bicycle now we
move<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.409> 20-inch<00:01:08.040> geared<00:01:08.400> bikes<00:01:08.640> and

move to our 20-inch geared bikes and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
move to our 20-inch geared bikes and
this<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> introducing<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> final<00:01:10.470> component

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
this is introducing the final component

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190 
this is introducing the final component

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
is shifting so the rider now has

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.410 
is shifting so the rider now has
knowledge<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.490> how<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.670> use<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> hand<00:01:18.240> brake
