00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.000 
the lower-end devices here in the galaxy
a3<00:00:08.480> because<00:00:09.480> people<00:00:09.809> probably<00:00:09.929> want<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> see

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this so we do have the iPhone for us

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.580 
this so we do have the iPhone for us
when<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> remote<00:00:14.849> 2g<00:00:15.210> 2014<00:00:16.199> edition

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
when you have the remote 2g 2014 edition

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
when you have the remote 2g 2014 edition
we<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> ACE<00:00:17.039> 4<00:00:17.430> which<00:00:17.970> also<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> pretty

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
we have the ACE 4 which also is a pretty

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.769 
we have the ACE 4 which also is a pretty
new<00:00:18.900> device<00:00:19.230> dual-core<00:00:19.949> Kota<00:00:20.760> say<00:00:20.970> 53<00:00:21.480> here

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
new device dual-core Kota say 53 here

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.630 
new device dual-core Kota say 53 here
during<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> 306<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.800> think<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.340> journal

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
during the 306 I think to the journal

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.330 
during the 306 I think to the journal
305<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.730> yeah<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> let's<00:00:28.289> check<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> out

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
305 and yeah so let's check this out

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.109 
305 and yeah so let's check this out
here<00:00:29.670> shall<00:00:29.970> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
here shall we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.410 
here shall we
I'm<00:00:30.480> gonna<00:00:30.750> run<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.320> medium<00:00:32.189> visual<00:00:32.910> effects

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I'm gonna run on medium visual effects

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.170 
I'm gonna run on medium visual effects
and<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.370> resolution<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.460> low<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and the resolution is low on all of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
and the resolution is low on all of
these<00:00:36.329> Android<00:00:37.079> devices<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.190> shadows

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
these Android devices and shadows

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.619 
these Android devices and shadows
classic<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> core<00:00:40.140> affections<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.770> low<00:00:41.629> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
classic in the core affections on low is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
classic in the core affections on low is
because<00:00:42.690> these<00:00:43.680> devices<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:46.489> little<00:00:47.489> bit

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because these devices are a little bit

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.619 
because these devices are a little bit
more<00:00:47.960> lower<00:00:48.960> end<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.270> we'll<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:51.600> one

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
more lower end and we'll see which one

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:03.310 
more lower end and we'll see which one
performs<00:00:52.140> best<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> let's<00:01:01.699> fire<00:01:02.699> this

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
performs best here so let's fire this

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:30.270 
performs best here so let's fire this
game<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.559> shall<00:01:05.430> we

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.030 

13<00:01:31.030> it's<00:01:31.150> like<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.390> iPhone<00:01:31.780> 4s<00:01:32.410> Stefan<00:01:32.920> it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
13 it's like the iPhone 4s Stefan it

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.130 
13 it's like the iPhone 4s Stefan it
takes<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.400> longest<00:01:33.670> time<00:01:33.910> to<00:01:33.940> load<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.080> I'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
takes the longest time to load so I'm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:52.990 
takes the longest time to load so I'm
just<00:01:35.260> going<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.440> start<00:01:35.680> to<00:01:35.770> play<00:01:36.010> on<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:37.060> ACE<00:01:37.240> 4

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.550 

so<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.570> see<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:54.810> you're<00:01:55.289> kind<00:01:55.469> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
so as you see here you're kind of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:19.150 
so as you see here you're kind of
stretching<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.640> performance

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.770 

so<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.640> its<00:02:20.790> play<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.420> fine

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
so you can see its play this game fine

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:38.080 
so you can see its play this game fine
here<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.350> need<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.970> lower<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.150> graphics

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.940 

there's<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.420> different<00:02:39.480> still<00:02:40.170> lag<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
there's very different still lag a

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.920 
there's very different still lag a
little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.340> here<00:02:41.580> there<00:02:41.930> glitches

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
little bit here there glitches

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:55.120 
little bit here there glitches
definitely<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.830> drive<00:02:44.160> fast

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.040 

but<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> snow<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.730> draw<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.390> course<00:02:57.630> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
but the snow you draw here of course the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.480 
but the snow you draw here of course the
better<00:02:58.230> performance<00:02:58.950> overall<00:03:01.069> now<00:03:02.069> let's

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
better performance overall now let's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.530 
better performance overall now let's
check<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.209> out<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.260> a3<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.330> play

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
check it out here on the a3 this is play

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.280 
check it out here on the a3 this is play
definitely<00:03:09.780> looks<00:03:10.110> nicer<00:03:12.020> kind<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.110> feels

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
definitely looks nicer kind of feels

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.380 
definitely looks nicer kind of feels
here<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.890> performs<00:03:14.370> little<00:03:15.090> bit<00:03:15.180> better

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
here like it performs little bit better

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:29.720 
here like it performs little bit better
here<00:03:15.720> than<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.989> ACE<00:03:16.140> for

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:42.360 

steel<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:31.150> slow<00:03:31.540> down

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.610 

but<00:03:42.940> yeah<00:03:43.180> definite<00:03:43.750> forms<00:03:44.110> better<00:03:44.319> here<00:03:44.590> than

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
but yeah definite forms better here than

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.430 
but yeah definite forms better here than
the<00:03:45.459> s4<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:46.720> actually<00:03:46.989> perform<00:03:47.140> through

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
the s4 it can actually perform through

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.540 
the s4 it can actually perform through
really<00:03:47.680> really<00:03:47.920> good<00:03:48.129> here<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.519> also

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
really really good here but you also

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.119 
really really good here but you also
listed<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.330> scroll<00:03:55.629> I<00:03:55.690> want<00:03:56.140> to<00:03:58.860> lower<00:03:59.860> the

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
listed I scroll I want to lower the

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:20.490 
listed I scroll I want to lower the
graphics

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.920 

I'm<00:04:20.950> really<00:04:21.160> not<00:04:21.340> sure<00:04:21.400> why<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:22.060> German<00:04:22.390> 3:06

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
I'm really not sure why a German 3:06

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.890 
I'm really not sure why a German 3:06
performed<00:04:23.470> this<00:04:23.650> bad<00:04:24.510> because<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.660> thought

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
performed this bad because I thought

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.220 
performed this bad because I thought
that<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:26.290> wouldn't<00:04:26.560> be<00:04:26.680> better<00:04:28.230> it's

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
that it wouldn't be better it's

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.100 
that it wouldn't be better it's
definitely<00:04:29.980> not<00:04:30.160> okay<00:04:30.700> for<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:31.090> 300-year<00:04:31.960> of

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
definitely not okay for a 300-year of

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.060 
definitely not okay for a 300-year of
phone<00:04:32.320> if<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.280> definitely<00:04:33.870> perform<00:04:34.870> better

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.120 

but<00:04:42.070> wait<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.460> bigger<00:04:42.610> display<00:04:43.180> here<00:04:44.130> then

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
but wait the bigger display here then

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.290 
but wait the bigger display here then
the<00:04:45.280> ACE<00:04:45.400> 4<00:04:45.850> or<00:04:46.300> this<00:04:46.930> feels<00:04:47.380> like<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:48.300> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
the ACE 4 or this feels like and the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.970 
the ACE 4 or this feels like and the
better<00:04:49.660> form<00:04:49.960> factor<00:04:50.350> this<00:04:50.560> one<00:04:50.800> definitely

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
better form factor this one definitely

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.560 
better form factor this one definitely
is<00:04:51.400> better<00:04:52.950> now<00:04:53.950> let's<00:04:54.250> check<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.000> out<00:04:55.090> here<00:04:55.420> on

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
is better now let's check it out here on

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:08.900 
is better now let's check it out here on
the<00:04:56.220> move<00:04:57.220> to<00:04:57.370> G<00:04:57.720> 2014<00:04:58.720> edition

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:18.370 

whoa<00:05:14.060> what<00:05:15.060> am<00:05:15.180> i<00:05:15.270> doing

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.330 

this<00:05:19.380> one<00:05:19.560> has<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> journal<00:05:20.070> three<00:05:20.310> or<00:05:20.430> five<00:05:20.730> in

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
this one has a journal three or five in

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.320 
this one has a journal three or five in
a<00:05:23.340> seven<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:25.430> it's<00:05:26.430> better<00:05:26.760> that's<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.180> good

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
a seven and it's better that's a good

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.150 
a seven and it's better that's a good
question<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:30.140> mean<00:05:31.140> they<00:05:31.380> are<00:05:31.440> all<00:05:31.560> kind<00:05:31.980> of<00:05:32.100> a

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
question I mean they are all kind of a

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.390 
question I mean they are all kind of a
little<00:05:32.400> bit<00:05:32.520> similar<00:05:33.590> it's<00:05:34.590> kind<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.830> hard<00:05:35.100> to

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
little bit similar it's kind of hard to

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.840 
little bit similar it's kind of hard to
recognize<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:36.600> which<00:05:36.930> one<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.760> little<00:05:38.760> bit

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
recognize so which one is a little bit

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:46.480 
recognize so which one is a little bit
more<00:05:39.030> powerful<00:05:39.660> here

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.920 

it's<00:05:46.820> probably<00:05:47.120> not<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.330> major<00:05:47.600> difference

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
it's probably not a major difference

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.320 
it's probably not a major difference
between<00:05:48.229> the<00:05:48.620> journal<00:05:48.949> 306<00:05:49.610> GPU<00:05:49.699> and<00:05:50.240> a

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
between the journal 306 GPU and a

00:05:50.330 --> 00:06:13.680 
between the journal 306 GPU and a
journal<00:05:50.630> 305<00:05:54.820> CU<00:05:55.820> r<00:05:55.970> if<00:05:56.120> we<00:05:56.419> lower<00:05:56.840> it

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.220 

this<00:06:14.690> could<00:06:14.960> actually<00:06:14.990> be<00:06:15.380> even<00:06:15.830> better<00:06:16.160> than

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
this could actually be even better than

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:32.610 
this could actually be even better than
the<00:06:18.230> a7<00:06:18.890> I<00:06:22.360> mean<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.510> e3

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.709 

yeah<00:06:33.620> I<00:06:33.650> think<00:06:34.189> Ashley<00:06:34.819> this<00:06:34.969> one<00:06:35.180> performs<00:06:35.629> a

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
yeah I think Ashley this one performs a

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:38.950 
yeah I think Ashley this one performs a
little<00:06:35.960> bit<00:06:36.050> better<00:06:36.259> here<00:06:36.650> than<00:06:36.710> the<00:06:37.749> then<00:06:38.749> the

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
little bit better here than the then the

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.909 
little bit better here than the then the
galaxy<00:06:39.379> III<00:06:44.199> probably<00:06:45.199> because<00:06:45.439> there's<00:06:45.680> more

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
galaxy III probably because there's more

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.119 
galaxy III probably because there's more
of<00:06:46.009> a<00:06:46.099> clean<00:06:46.370> version<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.849> Android<00:06:47.240> as<00:06:47.360> well

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
of a clean version of Android as well

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:54.820 
of a clean version of Android as well
not<00:06:49.129> touch<00:06:49.430> with

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.249 

but<00:06:55.830> of<00:06:55.949> course<00:06:55.979> the<00:06:56.909> one<00:06:57.089> that's<00:06:57.360> probably

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
but of course the one that's probably

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.659 
but of course the one that's probably
going<00:06:58.529> to<00:06:58.649> crush<00:06:58.830> it<00:06:58.860> here

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
going to crush it here

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:09.109 
going to crush it here
the<00:07:00.330> iPhone<00:07:00.779> for<00:07:01.199> us

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:13.260 

Wow<00:07:10.119> okay<00:07:10.990> so<00:07:11.580> there's<00:07:12.580> a<00:07:12.639> clear<00:07:12.909> winner<00:07:12.969> here

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
Wow okay so there's a clear winner here

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.320 
Wow okay so there's a clear winner here
I<00:07:13.629> mean<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:14.050> iPhone<00:07:14.349> for<00:07:14.619> us<00:07:14.740> still<00:07:15.580> kills<00:07:16.029> in

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
I mean the iPhone for us still kills in

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.859 
I mean the iPhone for us still kills in
gaming<00:07:16.689> I<00:07:16.869> mean<00:07:17.139> it<00:07:17.289> crushes<00:07:18.119> still<00:07:19.119> is<00:07:19.330> a<00:07:19.360> very

00:07:19.859 --> 00:07:19.869 
gaming I mean it crushes still is a very

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:22.409 
gaming I mean it crushes still is a very
very<00:07:20.020> capable<00:07:20.379> device<00:07:21.149> so<00:07:22.149> they<00:07:22.270> could

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
very capable device so they could

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:26.730 
very capable device so they could
definitely<00:07:22.539> be<00:07:23.050> good<00:07:23.319> there<00:07:23.589> to<00:07:23.860> know<00:07:25.289> and<00:07:26.289> it

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
definitely be good there to know and it

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.809 
definitely be good there to know and it
may<00:07:26.860> not<00:07:27.039> have<00:07:27.219> the<00:07:27.369> biggest<00:07:27.819> display<00:07:28.119> but

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819 
may not have the biggest display but

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.119 
may not have the biggest display but
with<00:07:30.819> a<00:07:30.849> great<00:07:31.149> performance<00:07:31.719> it's<00:07:32.139> you<00:07:33.009> know

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.129 
with a great performance it's you know

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:58.440 
with a great performance it's you know
it's<00:07:33.580> nice

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.450 

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.930 

oh<00:07:58.480> my<00:07:59.170> god<00:07:59.380> I<00:07:59.650> there<00:08:00.340> was<00:08:00.400> some<00:08:00.580> light<00:08:00.760> there

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:00.940 
oh my god I there was some light there

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.060 
oh my god I there was some light there
as<00:08:01.030> well<00:08:01.270> but<00:08:01.480> I<00:08:01.750> mean<00:08:02.170> clearly<00:08:02.530> this<00:08:02.740> one<00:08:02.950> is

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.070 
as well but I mean clearly this one is

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.490 
as well but I mean clearly this one is
the<00:08:03.250> best<00:08:03.370> one<00:08:03.670> so<00:08:03.700> just<00:08:04.180> quickly<00:08:05.050> a<00:08:05.200> video
