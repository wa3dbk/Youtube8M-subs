so here we have my lego mythos in
planning<00:00:24.710> mode<00:00:24.890> which<00:00:25.370> like<00:00:25.730> most<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.180> my

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
planning mode which like most of my

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.620 
planning mode which like most of my
level<00:00:26.539> creations<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.110> mini<00:00:27.619> in<00:00:27.860> size<00:00:28.369> now<00:00:29.240> in

looks like um this actually is maybe

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.220 
looks like um this actually is maybe
sensor<00:00:46.190> housing<00:00:46.370> or<00:00:46.970> living<00:00:47.660> space<00:00:47.960> or

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
sensor housing or living space or

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.690 
sensor housing or living space or
shielding<00:00:48.739> I'm<00:00:48.950> not<00:00:49.130> entirely<00:00:49.340> sure<00:00:49.430> which

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
entirely I can play something very close

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.669 
entirely I can play something very close
now<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:10.520> wasn't<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.789> movie<00:01:11.090> um<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:12.439> then<00:01:12.590> I

again how it was in the movie and you'll
notice<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:19.069> isn't<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.969> know<00:01:20.090> quite<00:01:20.810> light

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
notice this isn't you know quite light

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:22.449 
notice this isn't you know quite light
not<00:01:21.079> there<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.259> little<00:01:21.380> bit<00:01:21.560> sticking<00:01:22.130> out<00:01:22.340> to

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
not there a little bit sticking out to

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.359 
not there a little bit sticking out to
the<00:01:22.579> side<00:01:22.789> which<00:01:23.779> you<00:01:23.810> know<00:01:24.049> of<00:01:24.649> course<00:01:24.859> is<00:01:25.189> I

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
the side which you know of course is I

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.760 
the side which you know of course is I
wasn't<00:01:25.639> the<00:01:25.789> movie<00:01:25.999> and<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:26.810> do<00:01:26.869> that<00:01:27.079> I<00:01:27.259> added

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
wasn't the movie and can do that I added

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.469 
wasn't the movie and can do that I added
this<00:01:28.299> but<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.590> placed<00:01:30.590> here<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.039> then<00:01:31.479> attach

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
this but I placed here and then attach

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.230 
this but I placed here and then attach
this<00:01:32.869> that<00:01:33.829> makes<00:01:34.009> only<00:01:34.279> you<00:01:34.399> know<00:01:34.490> I'm<00:01:34.819> a<00:01:34.939> half

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
this that makes only you know I'm a half

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.889 
this that makes only you know I'm a half
a<00:01:35.389> stud

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
a stud

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.230 
a stud
um<00:01:37.959> sticking<00:01:38.959> out<00:01:39.079> which<00:01:39.859> I<00:01:40.130> felt<00:01:40.549> looked<00:01:40.909> more

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
um sticking out which I felt looked more

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.179 
um sticking out which I felt looked more
accurate<00:01:41.689> than<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.869> false<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:42.469> more<00:01:43.130> in

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
accurate than a false but more in

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:43.690 
accurate than a false but more in
proportion

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
proportion

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.159 
proportion
um<00:01:44.499> and<00:01:45.499> then<00:01:46.329> don't<00:01:47.329> mess<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.659> engines<00:01:48.020> we

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.169 
um and then don't mess the engines we

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:51.459 
um and then don't mess the engines we
have<00:01:48.200> kind<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.039> a<00:01:49.130> little<00:01:49.249> black<00:01:49.969> stud<00:01:50.749> here<00:01:51.259> a

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
have kind of a little black stud here a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.209 
have kind of a little black stud here a
piece<00:01:52.119> wreck<00:01:53.119> here<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.509> put<00:01:53.869> kind<00:01:54.799> of<00:01:54.859> see<00:01:55.069> the

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
piece wreck here I put kind of see the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.339 
piece wreck here I put kind of see the
black<00:01:55.609> of<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.789> table<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.239> we<00:01:56.630> got<00:01:56.779> that<00:01:57.020> slip

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
black of the table and we got that slip

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.499 
black of the table and we got that slip
though<00:01:57.529> I'm<00:01:57.739> not<00:01:57.829> entirely<00:01:58.069> sure<00:01:58.329> what<00:01:59.329> its

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
though I'm not entirely sure what its

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.849 
though I'm not entirely sure what its
function<00:01:59.689> is<00:01:59.989> like<00:02:00.169> what<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.560> does<00:02:00.649> in<00:02:00.799> the

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
function is like what it does in the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.959 
function is like what it does in the
movie<00:02:01.130> i<00:02:01.340> was<00:02:01.819> there<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:01.999> i<00:02:02.209> added<00:02:02.389> it<00:02:02.599> and<00:02:03.590> then

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
movie i was there so i added it and then

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.069 
movie i was there so i added it and then
initially<00:02:04.969> I<00:02:05.119> was<00:02:05.329> going<00:02:05.389> to<00:02:05.569> actually<00:02:05.719> do<00:02:05.989> the

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
initially I was going to actually do the

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.570 
initially I was going to actually do the
engine<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.909> at<00:02:08.360> two<00:02:08.570> by<00:02:08.750> two<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> only<00:02:10.369> new

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
engine and at two by two the only new

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.680 
engine and at two by two the only new
piece<00:02:10.820> if<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.150> play<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.540> goes<00:02:11.660> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
piece if you play what that goes you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.150 
piece if you play what that goes you

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
I can forget that to work out so I went

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.330 
I can forget that to work out so I went
with<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.800> by<00:02:15.950> one

we're here with studs all around and a 1
by<00:02:18.830> 1<00:02:18.860> brick<00:02:19.040> here<00:02:19.430> with<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> hole<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:19.970> the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
middle the foot pegs ooh I could attach

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.840 
middle the foot pegs ooh I could attach
to<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.880> um<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:24.080> feel<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.770> actually<00:02:24.920> works

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
to this um I feel that actually works

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.420 
to this um I feel that actually works
out<00:02:26.060> better<00:02:26.830> because<00:02:27.830> I'm<00:02:28.100> when<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> flex

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
out better because I'm when I flex

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.700 
out better because I'm when I flex
handling<00:02:28.730> around<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.390> looks<00:02:29.710> somewhat

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
handling around it it looks somewhat

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.810 
handling around it it looks somewhat
cylindrical<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:33.560> more<00:02:33.860> for<00:02:34.400> tional<00:02:34.670> for

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
cylindrical and it's more for tional for

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820 
cylindrical and it's more for tional for
the<00:02:34.880> rest<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.210> ship<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:36.320> fact<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.710> only

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the rest of the ship in fact the only

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.790 
the rest of the ship in fact the only
part<00:02:37.070> I'm<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.190> currently<00:02:37.700> happy<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:38.150> is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
part I'm not currently happy with is

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.400 
part I'm not currently happy with is
this<00:02:39.800> piece<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:41.030> piece<00:02:41.090> which<00:02:41.930> should

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
this piece and this piece which should

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.170 
this piece and this piece which should
be<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.710> pray<00:02:43.010> um

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
be like pray um

be like pray um
no<00:02:44.600> way<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.320> pretty<00:02:45.500> close<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.950> didn't<00:02:46.220> count

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
no way it's pretty close I didn't count

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.400 
no way it's pretty close I didn't count
those<00:02:46.850> pieces<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.330> light<00:02:47.450> gray<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.260> mean

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
those pieces in light gray so I mean

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.050 
those pieces in light gray so I mean
nothing's<00:02:48.740> pretty<00:02:48.950> close<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.460> it's<00:02:50.030> not

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
nothing's pretty close but it's not

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.670 
nothing's pretty close but it's not
entirely<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.570> if<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.750> can<00:02:50.780> change<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.320> that's

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
entirely I can if I can change it that's

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.650 
entirely I can if I can change it that's
the<00:02:51.860> one<00:02:52.010> thing<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.220> change<00:02:52.490> but<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.420> know<00:02:53.510> it's

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
the one thing I change but you know it's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.140 
the one thing I change but you know it's
definitely<00:02:53.930> still<00:02:54.530> very<00:02:54.680> close<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.280> then

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
definitely still very close and then

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.270 
definitely still very close and then
we've<00:02:56.300> got<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.810> back<00:02:57.350> which<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.770> certainly

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
we've got the back which is certainly

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280 
we've got the back which is certainly
slanted<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> movie<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.540> bottom

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
slanted like in the movie and the bottom

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.260 
slanted like in the movie and the bottom
which<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.440> sloped<00:03:01.100> again<00:03:01.460> like<00:03:01.820> in<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.000> movie

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
which is sloped again like in the movie

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.130 
which is sloped again like in the movie
and<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:03.770> you<00:03:03.950> want<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.430> can<00:03:04.550> take<00:03:04.730> these

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
and then if you want you can take these

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.780 
and then if you want you can take these
semi-transparent<00:03:06.140> blue<00:03:06.470> pieces<00:03:06.740> and<00:03:07.550> put

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
semi-transparent blue pieces and put

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.070 
semi-transparent blue pieces and put
them<00:03:09.370> what's<00:03:10.370> happened<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.850> put<00:03:11.810> onto<00:03:11.960> the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
them what's happened and put onto the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.810 
them what's happened and put onto the
bottom<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.650> engine<00:03:14.050> like<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.350> um<00:03:15.820> to

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
bottom of the engine like this um to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.460 
bottom of the engine like this um to
make<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.060> look<00:03:17.150> like<00:03:17.270> it's<00:03:17.420> landing<00:03:18.020> or<00:03:18.230> taking

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
make it look like it's landing or taking

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.220 
make it look like it's landing or taking
off<00:03:18.770> give<00:03:19.760> those<00:03:20.000> give<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.750> engine<00:03:21.110> noise

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
off give those give the engine noise

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.140 
off give those give the engine noise
kind<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.530> um<00:03:22.090> glow<00:03:23.260> effect<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:25.340> like<00:03:25.850> make<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
kind of um glow effect to like make it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.050 
kind of um glow effect to like make it
look<00:03:26.330> like<00:03:26.420> it's<00:03:26.600> on<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:28.070> then<00:03:28.160> we<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.460> be

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
look like it's on and then we have it be

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.030 
look like it's on and then we have it be
Prometheus<00:03:29.570> is<00:03:29.720> landing<00:03:30.170> or<00:03:30.350> taking<00:03:30.530> off<00:03:30.740> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
Prometheus is landing or taking off and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
Prometheus is landing or taking off and
sink<00:03:31.670> after<00:03:31.760> bottom<00:03:32.150> yeah<00:03:32.450> as<00:03:32.870> in<00:03:33.260> effect<00:03:33.530> and

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
sink after bottom yeah as in effect and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.310 
sink after bottom yeah as in effect and
of<00:03:34.520> course<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.060> ship<00:03:35.090> has<00:03:35.570> one<00:03:35.900> really<00:03:36.200> cool

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
of course the ship has one really cool

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.870 
of course the ship has one really cool
feature<00:03:36.620> which<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:36.920> wasn't<00:03:37.190> about<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.400> exclude

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
feature which I wasn't about to exclude

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.830 
feature which I wasn't about to exclude
and<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.680> rotate<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.370> engines

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
and that is you can rotate the engines

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.710 
and that is you can rotate the engines
so<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.400> exits<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:43.940> nozzles<00:03:44.209> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
so that the exits or nozzles and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.699 
so that the exits or nozzles and
whatever<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.920> call<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.250> part<00:03:47.709> faces

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
whatever you call this part faces

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.900 
whatever you call this part faces
towards<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:50.240> wheel<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.430> thus<00:03:52.430> gives<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
towards the wheel and thus gives the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.330 
towards the wheel and thus gives the
ship<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.390> omentum<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.500> know<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.740> mean<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.070> ship

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
ship for omentum you know I mean a ship

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.180 
ship for omentum you know I mean a ship
that<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.150> land<00:03:56.360> up<00:03:56.480> now<00:03:56.690> that's<00:03:56.810> cool<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.350> so

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
that can land up now that's cool but so

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.670 
that can land up now that's cool but so
much<00:03:58.340> mash<00:03:58.550> it<00:03:59.110> and<00:04:00.110> then<00:04:00.230> you'll<00:04:00.530> remember

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
much mash it and then you'll remember

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.220 
much mash it and then you'll remember
earlier<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.370> said<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.700> used<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.870> by<00:04:03.050> one

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
earlier I said I used the one by one

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.260 
earlier I said I used the one by one
wick<00:04:03.620> with<00:04:04.100> suds<00:04:04.520> going<00:04:04.730> all<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.940> way<00:04:04.970> around

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
wick with suds going all the way around

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.710 
wick with suds going all the way around
and<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.570> actually<00:04:06.500> comes<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.830> contact<00:04:07.040> with

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
and that actually comes in contact with

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.610 
and that actually comes in contact with
this<00:04:09.340> piece<00:04:10.340> here<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.660> I<00:04:12.020> can<00:04:12.260> hit<00:04:12.560> it

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
this piece here so you I can hit it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800 
this piece here so you I can hit it
against<00:04:12.920> there<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.610> can<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.690> me

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
against there and that can have me

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.440 
against there and that can have me
figure<00:04:15.170> out<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.440> angle<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.910> engines<00:04:17.359> that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
figure out the angle of the engines that

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.120 
figure out the angle of the engines that
I<00:04:17.540> want<00:04:17.780> that<00:04:18.380> wasn't<00:04:18.620> intended<00:04:18.830> but<00:04:19.010> it's

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
I want that wasn't intended but it's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.820 
I want that wasn't intended but it's
definitely<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.430> very<00:04:19.489> convenient<00:04:20.000> side<00:04:20.450> effect

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
definitely a very convenient side effect

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.460 
definitely a very convenient side effect
and<00:04:21.830> then<00:04:21.919> here<00:04:22.130> we<00:04:22.220> have<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.520> from<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.030> side

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and then here we have it from the side

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.409 
and then here we have it from the side
from<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.560> back

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
from the back

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.179 
from the back
the<00:04:26.539> other<00:04:26.659> side<00:04:27.159> from<00:04:28.159> the<00:04:28.249> bottom<00:04:30.699> side<00:04:33.189> from

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
the other side from the bottom side from

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.790 
the other side from the bottom side from
the<00:04:34.340> top<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.199> finally<00:04:36.430> from<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.639> front<00:04:38.029> in

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
the top and finally from the front in

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.290 
the top and finally from the front in
flight<00:04:39.800> mode<00:04:40.719> that<00:04:41.719> then<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:43.520> Lego

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
flight mode that then is the Lego

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.929 
flight mode that then is the Lego
Prometheus<00:04:45.259> but<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:46.069> is<00:04:46.370> my<00:04:46.699> little

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
Prometheus but that is my little

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.480 
Prometheus but that is my little
prometheus<00:04:47.509> hope<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.199> enjoyed<00:04:48.439> it<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.740> see
