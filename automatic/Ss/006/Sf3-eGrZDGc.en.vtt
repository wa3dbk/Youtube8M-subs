00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
for example titanium and these are often

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
for example titanium and these are often
used<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.789> they<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.360> very<00:00:45.629> strong

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
used because they have very very strong

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.229 
used because they have very very strong
structural<00:00:46.680> qualities<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.969> used<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
structural qualities they can be used to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.840 
structural qualities they can be used to
make<00:00:48.420> steel<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.050> hard<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:50.250> cutting<00:00:50.550> things

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
make steel very hard for cutting things

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369 
make steel very hard for cutting things
in<00:00:51.090> industry<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.020> used<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> make

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
in industry they can be used to make

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.979 
in industry they can be used to make
very<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.309> light<00:00:53.610> pieces<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.300> aircraft<00:00:54.750> for

very very light pieces of aircraft for

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.099 
very very light pieces of aircraft for
example<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.360> you've<00:00:57.360> got<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> distinguish<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
example so you've got to distinguish the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.400 
example so you've got to distinguish the
precious<00:00:58.440> metals<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:58.980> strategic<00:00:59.820> metals

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
precious metals and the strategic metals

going to be a nuisance if you have some

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.130 
going to be a nuisance if you have some
bars<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:57.000> platinum<00:01:57.240> round<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.810> your<00:01:57.930> house

even<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.530> they're<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> safe<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.729> might

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
even if they're in a safe you might

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
even if they're in a safe you might
attract<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> attention<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.810> burglars<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
attract the attention of burglars if you

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
attract the attention of burglars if you
don't<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.640> burgled<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.659> might<00:02:03.930> be

don't want to be burgled it might be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.389 
don't want to be burgled it might be
good<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> keep<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> bank<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.310> you

there's a similar problem with gold

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.300 
there's a similar problem with gold
which<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.630> heavily<00:02:48.810> used<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> bullion<00:02:49.920> metal

the markets they might try to reverse a
price<00:02:58.470> move<00:02:58.770> by<00:02:59.010> gold<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.520> gold<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.940> moving<00:03:00.209> up

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
price move by gold so gold is moving up

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.390 
price move by gold so gold is moving up
because<00:03:01.110> everyone<00:03:01.380> feels<00:03:01.650> unhappy<00:03:01.860> about<00:03:02.190> the

their own purposes and also to

manipulate the price of gold back down

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.710 
manipulate the price of gold back down
again<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.580> deal<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.000> gold<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.360> silver

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
again so if you deal in gold and silver

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.170 
again so if you deal in gold and silver
you<00:03:13.200> have<00:03:13.230> healthy<00:03:13.770> volumes<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:14.970> easily

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
you have healthy volumes you can easily

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180 
you have healthy volumes you can easily
get<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> market<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:17.010> the

get in and out of the market but the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.090 
get in and out of the market but the
prices<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.820> move<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.180> unexpected<00:03:18.840> ways<00:03:19.100> if

prices can move in unexpected ways if

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.920 
prices can move in unexpected ways if

opposite problem the volumes are very

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.199 
opposite problem the volumes are very

you want to if the volumes are thin you

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.210 
you want to if the volumes are thin you
can<00:03:40.019> find<00:03:40.290> yourself<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.830> position<00:03:40.950> where

your<00:03:52.500> advantage<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.519> things<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:53.820> platinum

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
your advantage with things like platinum

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.990 
your advantage with things like platinum
palladium<00:03:54.709> rhodium<00:03:55.709> ruthenium<00:03:55.860> is<00:03:56.400> they're

palladium rhodium ruthenium is they're

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330 
palladium rhodium ruthenium is they're
generally<00:03:57.330> not<00:03:57.570> used<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:58.049> boolean<00:03:58.380> metals<00:03:58.709> so

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
generally not used as boolean metals so

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.920 
generally not used as boolean metals so
you're<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.580> actually<00:03:59.760> setting<00:04:00.330> yourself<00:04:00.720> up

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
you're not actually setting yourself up

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.680 
you're not actually setting yourself up
against<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> major<00:04:01.799> banks<00:04:02.570> they're<00:04:03.570> not
