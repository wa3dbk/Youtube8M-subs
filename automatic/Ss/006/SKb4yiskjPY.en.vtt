the plum so dry some of the jobs that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.910 
the plum so dry some of the jobs that
need<00:01:25.500> doing<00:01:25.909> well<00:01:26.909> grass<00:01:27.180> needs<00:01:27.450> bemoaned<00:01:27.920> in

need doing well grass needs bemoaned in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.230 
need doing well grass needs bemoaned in
fact<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.189> been<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.520> wet

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
fact it's been so wet

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
fact it's been so wet
but<00:01:30.780> ie<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> grass<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.560> grown<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:32.189> rapidly

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but ie the grass has grown very rapidly

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.600 
but ie the grass has grown very rapidly
and<00:01:33.030> B<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.630> haven't<00:01:33.960> ever<00:01:34.020> mow<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.740> our

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and B we haven't ever mow it because our

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
and B we haven't ever mow it because our
machinery<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.810> adequate<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> job

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
machinery is just adequate to the job

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.940 
machinery is just adequate to the job
but<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:38.150> knowing<00:01:39.150> sopping<00:01:39.840> wet<00:01:39.869> grass<00:01:40.409> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
but not knowing sopping wet grass it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
but not knowing sopping wet grass it's
just<00:01:41.130> impossibly<00:01:41.549> difficult<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
just impossibly difficult to do that so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.310 
just impossibly difficult to do that so
we're<00:01:42.990> hoping<00:01:43.549> if<00:01:44.689> there's<00:01:45.689> light<00:01:45.960> breeze<00:01:46.290> and
