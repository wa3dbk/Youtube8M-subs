about<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.130> closure<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:46.090> wanna

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
about this closure that I really wanna

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.990 
about this closure that I really wanna
rip<00:02:46.540> about<00:02:46.840> was<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.370> lace<00:02:48.760> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
rip about was that the lace is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.210 
rip about was that the lace is
reinforced<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.080> edges<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.830> closure

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
reinforced so the edges of this closure

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.280 
reinforced so the edges of this closure
are<00:02:52.120> reinforced<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:54.600> what<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.780> means<00:02:56.020> is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
are reinforced and what that means is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.470 
are reinforced and what that means is
it's<00:02:57.040> not<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.460> straight<00:02:57.640> lace<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.270> was

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
it's not just straight lace so I was

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.500
