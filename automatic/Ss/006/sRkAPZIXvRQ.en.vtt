software<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.200> version<00:02:07.590> 0.4<00:02:08.220> one

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
software because it's version 0.4 one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.430 
software because it's version 0.4 one
but<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> seems<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.360> work<00:02:09.450> fine<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.140> next<00:02:10.289> up
