00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.133
 When you see the Tour of Flanders, Paris Roubaix and some other classics, it is so different from the traditional road race. 

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:23.400
 So many pebbles, pits, gravel roads, 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.033
 Those games are more than just games. 

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:39.467
 Our long-term cooperation with Fabian Cancellara has attempted to develop new technologies to help him achieve higher speeds. 

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:43.567
 He always said, friend, I need to get a more supple ride on the cobblestone road. 

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:50.534
 You know, I need to ride longer, faster, and more powerful. I don't want to lose every effort. 

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:55.133
 Fabian wants exactly what every driver wants. 

00:00:55.133 --> 00:01:03.133
 Each cyclist wants a more supple ride, more comfortable and more stable, while transferring every drop of force to their bike. 

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.534
 Domane is such a car. 

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:13.167
 Combine long-lasting comfort into the legendary chariot of the Tour de France. 

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:17.067
 Trek Domane includes three breakthrough technologies. 

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:25.801
 IsoSpeed, Power Transfer Construction, and long-lasting comfort geometry. 

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:42.334
 We focus on the vibration of the body on the bicycle, and we are fully aware of that point, the eyeball vibration frequency is 30 to 60 Hz, and the arm is 20 Hz. 

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:47.267
 When you are riding, you can feel the kind of jump and vibration. 

00:01:50.267 --> 00:02:00.868
 IsoSpeed ​​is a design that removes energy from the frame or wheel axle before it is delivered to your body. 

00:02:00.868 --> 00:02:08.868
 We make the seat tube independent of the frame and can flex and stretch properly so as not to lose the slightest handling characteristics. 

00:02:11.634 --> 00:02:21.467
 We experimented with a variety of options and chose IsoSpeed. Deconstruct the C tube and other parts of the frame for more regression. 

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:26.868
 We will use this concept and the first prototype car propulsion laboratory to install the system on the seat cushion and start data measurement. 

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:32.868
 Simulate what the rider encountered when he encountered a large bump. 

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:39.234
 We found that basically we got twice the regression, which means that when you encounter bumps, you will feel the impact is only half the size, 

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:44.267
 Or you have twice the impact, but it feels no different from the original. 

00:02:47.968 --> 00:03:03.334
 Engineers use this to analyze and verify that it is also important that we work with the drivers to prove that our design can achieve the results of the data. 

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:07.200
 They brought the driver, world champion Fabian Cancellara. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 I am also a driver myself. It is a pleasure to meet with Fabian. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.067
 So I saw that he took the car, rode it, pedaled, and started riding on the cobblestone road. I was still a little nervous. 

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:20.100
 He is an elusive person. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.000
 You look at his face and can't see his thoughts. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.334
 Finally he stopped and crossed the car with a big smile on his face. He said that this is the car I am going to take in Paris Roubaix. 

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:39.767
 We know that IsoSpeed ​​is an excellent technology, and we know that it is not enough. 

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:46.434
 We also want to improve on the front of the bike, which is a completely different issue. 

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.767
 We started with the fork. 

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:55.133
 In the same way, we want to retain the excellent handling of the Madone series, so we still use the E2 super head tube set. 

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.667
 At the same time, we also look at how to improve the front fork? 

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:04.667
 We bring the IsoSpeed ​​front fork with a large curvature and a long fork. 

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:10.934
 So it retains excellent handling and gives you more comfort with a larger curvature. 

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:18.801
 Another feature of Trek Domane is Power Transfer Construction. 

00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:23.067
 Let us integrate the original ideas and concepts. 

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:25.434
 Our BB90, our E2 system. 

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:33.434
 That is the pinnacle of our technology, allowing you to directly feed every drop of force on the pedal to the road. 

00:04:36.133 --> 00:04:41.868
 The real special reason for Trek Domane is the new long-lasting comfort geometry. 

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:47.200
 Again, we don't want to lose Madone's excellent handling, even blue. 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.334
 So when you are riding at 6 or 7 hours of high intensity, the bike must guarantee excellent handling. 

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:57.400
 One of the improvements is that we have increased the length of the lower fork. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.067
 It makes the wheel spacing slightly longer, providing more stability. 

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:09.467
 We have completed many of the previously set goals, but we know that we are developing an excellent bike. 

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:13.767
 Must pay attention to the details, so the 3S chain protection device was born. 

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:20.167
 We know that if the chain is kept in place under all weather conditions, it will really enhance the shifting performance, so that the driver will not be bothered by the chain at critical moments. 

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:23.667
 Thereby losing the chance of winning. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.601
 When Trek engineers took the Domane frame to the Bontrager team, we wanted to contribute to the project. 

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:41.868
 We focus on touch points and develop higher performances. 

00:05:41.868 --> 00:05:55.901
 The IsoZone handlebars provide integrated comfort in the upper and lower sections, reducing road vibration without increasing the diameter of the handlebars. 

00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:03.601
 The result is better ride quality while eliminating the need to implant a pad or wrap a double strap. 

00:06:05.734 --> 00:06:13.801
 If the products we make can satisfy the driver like Fabian Cancellara, we know that the goal is complete. 

00:06:13.801 --> 00:06:19.367
 This experience will be perfectly brought to our guests.
