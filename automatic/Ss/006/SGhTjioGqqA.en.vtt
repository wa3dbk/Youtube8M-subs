adding<00:00:01.020> and<00:00:01.140> subtracting<00:00:01.530> complex<00:00:01.920> numbers

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
adding and subtracting complex numbers

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.519 
adding and subtracting complex numbers
is<00:00:02.820> very<00:00:03.330> similar<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:04.049> adding<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
is very similar to adding and

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.740 
is very similar to adding and
subtracting<00:00:04.859> binomials<00:00:05.580> what<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.390> mean<00:00:06.600> by

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
subtracting binomials what I mean by

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.880 
subtracting binomials what I mean by
that<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.170> when<00:00:07.470> adding<00:00:07.770> or<00:00:07.859> subtracting

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
that is when adding or subtracting

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.700 
that is when adding or subtracting
binomials<00:00:08.849> we<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.780> only<00:00:09.929> add<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.349> subtract

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
binomials we can only add or subtract

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.310 
binomials we can only add or subtract
like<00:00:10.920> terms<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.900> when<00:00:12.900> adding<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
like terms and when adding and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.620 
like terms and when adding and
subtracting<00:00:13.620> complex<00:00:13.950> numbers<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.480> only

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
subtracting complex numbers we can only

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.340 
subtracting complex numbers we can only
add<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.199> real<00:00:16.560> parts<00:00:16.590> together<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:18.350> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
add the real parts together and the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.310 
add the real parts together and the
imaginary<00:00:19.949> parts<00:00:20.310> together<00:00:21.140> looking<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
imaginary parts together looking at the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.220 
imaginary parts together looking at the
first<00:00:22.560> example<00:00:23.039> we<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.250> 18<00:00:23.789> minus<00:00:24.029> 6i<00:00:24.660> plus

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
first example we have 18 minus 6i plus

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.670 
first example we have 18 minus 6i plus
negative<00:00:25.859> 9<00:00:26.099> minus<00:00:26.640> 3i<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:28.320> when<00:00:28.470> doing

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
negative 9 minus 3i I think when doing

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.259 
negative 9 minus 3i I think when doing
these<00:00:28.800> types<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.189> problems<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.880> helpful<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
these types of problems it's helpful to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600 
these types of problems it's helpful to
clear<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> parentheses<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.130> 18

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
clear the parentheses so we have 18

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.400 
clear the parentheses so we have 18
minus<00:00:33.000> 6i<00:00:34.820> plus<00:00:35.820> negative<00:00:36.390> 9<00:00:38.450> plus<00:00:39.450> negative

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
minus 6i plus negative 9 plus negative

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.810 
minus 6i plus negative 9 plus negative
3i<00:00:41.960> once<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> form<00:00:43.789> we<00:00:44.789> just

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
3i once we have it in this form we just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.029 
3i once we have it in this form we just
need<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> combine<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.780> real<00:00:46.320> parts<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
need to combine the real parts of the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.240 
need to combine the real parts of the
complex<00:00:47.489> numbers<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.680> combine<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
complex numbers and then combine the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.920 
complex numbers and then combine the
imaginary<00:00:50.789> parts<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> complex<00:00:51.750> numbers

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
imaginary parts of the complex numbers

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.099 
imaginary parts of the complex numbers
and<00:00:54.930> since<00:00:55.260> 18<00:00:55.800> plus<00:00:56.219> negative<00:00:56.460> 9<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.000> 9<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and since 18 plus negative 9 is 9 the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.010 
and since 18 plus negative 9 is 9 the
real<00:00:58.260> part<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> equal<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.100> 9<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
real part is equal to 9 and then for the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
real part is equal to 9 and then for the
imaginary<00:01:01.410> parts<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:01.949> negative<00:01:02.489> 6i<00:01:02.940> plus

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
imaginary parts we have negative 6i plus

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.030 
imaginary parts we have negative 6i plus
negative<00:01:04.140> 3i<00:01:06.110> which<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> equal<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> negative

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
negative 3i which is equal to negative

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.820 
negative 3i which is equal to negative
9i<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.390> could<00:01:09.570> write<00:01:09.750> plus<00:01:10.080> negative<00:01:10.409> 9i

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
9i so we could write plus negative 9i

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.320 
9i so we could write plus negative 9i
but<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:11.939> more<00:01:12.060> common<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> write<00:01:12.630> minus<00:01:13.110> 9i

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
but it's more common to write minus 9i

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.640 
but it's more common to write minus 9i
we<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> real<00:01:16.320> part<00:01:16.590> first

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
we do want to put the real part first

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.340 
we do want to put the real part first
and<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> imaginary<00:01:17.640> part<00:01:18.299> second<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and the imaginary part second so the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
and the imaginary part second so the
complex<00:01:19.799> number<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> correct<00:01:20.790> form<00:01:22.759> we

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
complex number is in the correct form we

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
complex number is in the correct form we
can<00:01:23.880> get<00:01:24.000> our<00:01:24.090> second<00:01:24.360> example<00:01:24.600> again<00:01:24.840> we're

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
can get our second example again we're

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.230 
can get our second example again we're
going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> clear<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> parentheses<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.340> when

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
going to clear the parentheses so when

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120 
going to clear the parentheses so when
subtracting<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.530> helpful<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.070> think

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
subtracting if it's helpful we can think

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.270 
subtracting if it's helpful we can think
of<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.729> distributing<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.450> negative<00:01:30.479> 1<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of this as distributing a negative 1 so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
of this as distributing a negative 1 so
we're<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.640> 18<00:01:33.619> minus<00:01:34.619> 6i<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.670> then

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we're going to have 18 minus 6i and then

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120 
we're going to have 18 minus 6i and then
because<00:01:36.780> we're<00:01:36.900> subtracting<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> going

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
because we're subtracting this is going

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.030 
because we're subtracting this is going
to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.310> plus<00:01:38.610> 9<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:40.409> again<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:40.799> we're

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to be plus 9 and again because we're

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.880 
to be plus 9 and again because we're
subtracting<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.720> plus<00:01:43.140> 3i

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
subtracting this is going to be plus 3i

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
subtracting this is going to be plus 3i
remember<00:01:44.640> subtracting<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> same<00:01:45.899> as

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
remember subtracting is the same as

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.639 
remember subtracting is the same as
adding<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.590> opposite<00:01:48.320> again<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.500> we'll

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
adding the opposite again now we'll

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.010 
adding the opposite again now we'll
combine<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> real<00:01:50.850> parts<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> complex

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
combine the real parts of the complex

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
combine the real parts of the complex
numbers<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:53.509> then<00:01:54.509> we'll<00:01:54.630> combine<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
numbers and then we'll combine the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.940 
numbers and then we'll combine the
imaginary<00:01:55.680> parts<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.399> complex<00:01:56.520> numbers

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
imaginary parts of the complex numbers

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.749 
imaginary parts of the complex numbers
so<00:01:58.950> 18<00:01:59.399> plus<00:01:59.850> 9<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.329> equal<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> 27<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.759> negative

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
so 18 plus 9 is equal to 27 and negative

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.260 
so 18 plus 9 is equal to 27 and negative
6i<00:02:03.210> plus<00:02:03.659> 3i<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.250> equal<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> negative<00:02:05.790> 3i

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
6i plus 3i would be equal to negative 3i

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.770 
6i plus 3i would be equal to negative 3i
so<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.320> minus<00:02:07.770> 3i

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.850 

so<00:02:13.780> as<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.960> can<00:02:14.050> see<00:02:14.110> as<00:02:14.320> long<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.680> follow

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
so as you can see as long as you follow

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.060 
so as you can see as long as you follow
the<00:02:15.010> same<00:02:15.280> rules<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.910> use<00:02:16.120> for<00:02:17.070> adding

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
the same rules that you use for adding
