people or 17 youtubers and this actually

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.189 
people or 17 youtubers and this actually
took<00:00:17.400> 1<00:00:17.699> hour<00:00:17.730> 30<00:00:18.180> minutes<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.900> put<00:00:19.170> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
took 1 hour 30 minutes I actually put it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.630 
took 1 hour 30 minutes I actually put it
take<00:00:19.380> longer<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:20.070> done<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> gun

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
take longer because I've done the gun

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
take longer because I've done the gun
the<00:00:20.880> backpack<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.600> big<00:00:21.750> boobies<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> all<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the backpack the big boobies and all the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.590 
the backpack the big boobies and all the
good<00:00:22.680> stuff<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.060> thought<00:00:24.359> it'd<00:00:24.480> take

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
good stuff and I thought it'd take

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.089 
good stuff and I thought it'd take
longer<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.050> actually<00:00:25.230> only<00:00:25.500> took<00:00:25.710> half<00:00:25.920> an

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
longer but it actually only took half an

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
longer but it actually only took half an
hour<00:00:26.220> longer<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.119> I've<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> narrowed<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
hour longer so I've kind of narrowed it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
hour longer so I've kind of narrowed it
down<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.500> let's<00:00:29.099> say<00:00:29.279> each<00:00:29.580> video<00:00:30.300> takes<00:00:30.539> about

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
down to let's say each video takes about

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380 
down to let's say each video takes about
an<00:00:30.929> hour<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> half<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.610> draw<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> stuff<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
an hour and half to draw and stuff so

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
an hour and half to draw and stuff so
that's<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.260> hour<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> half<00:00:34.829> 17<00:00:35.760> people
