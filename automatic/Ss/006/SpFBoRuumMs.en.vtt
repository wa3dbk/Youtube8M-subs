00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
basis that there are no connection point

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.270 
basis that there are no connection point
so<00:02:51.419> it<00:02:51.510> can't<00:02:51.720> connect<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.889> some<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.189> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
so it can't connect on to some of the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.909 
so it can't connect on to some of the
other<00:02:53.329> sets<00:02:54.329> like<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.659> Spinjitzu<00:02:55.230> Jojo<00:02:55.650> and

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
other sets like the Spinjitzu Jojo and

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.759 
other sets like the Spinjitzu Jojo and
the<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.269> tower<00:02:57.290> what's<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.439> called<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the little tower what's it called a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.190 
the little tower what's it called a
ninja<00:02:59.040> training<00:02:59.340> outpost<00:02:59.669> but<00:03:00.659> it's<00:03:01.019> still

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
ninja training outpost but it's still

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.869 
ninja training outpost but it's still

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
very cool and you can kind of see these

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.610 
very cool and you can kind of see these
loot<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.419> is<00:03:03.540> loose<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.079> moves<00:03:04.319> it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
loot this is loose and it moves it's

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
loot this is loose and it moves it's
because<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.010> Play<00:03:05.189> feature<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.269> what<00:03:06.450> I'm

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
because the Play feature so what I'm

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.390 
because the Play feature so what I'm
thinking<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:07.139> is<00:03:07.379> that<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.189> kind<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
thinking is is that this is just kind of

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.849 
thinking is is that this is just kind of
sitting<00:03:08.639> out<00:03:08.819> in<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.909> middle<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.180> nowhere<00:03:09.540> and
