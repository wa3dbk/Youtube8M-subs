00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.800 
rake this through with like a brush or
comb<00:03:48.069> that's<00:03:48.310> what<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.610> sometimes<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.510> make

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
comb that's what I do sometimes to make

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.929 
comb that's what I do sometimes to make
sure<00:03:50.019> that<00:03:50.200> every<00:03:50.739> single<00:03:50.890> strand<00:03:51.400> gets

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
sure that every single strand gets

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.520 
sure that every single strand gets
saturated<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:52.689> mayonnaise<00:03:53.049> but<00:03:53.260> today

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
saturated with the mayonnaise but today

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.140 
saturated with the mayonnaise but today
I<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:53.920> didn't<00:03:54.129> want<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> do<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.489> because<00:03:54.819> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
I just didn't want to do that because it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.300 
I just didn't want to do that because it
was<00:03:55.269> more<00:03:55.480> work<00:03:55.690> but<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.650> a<00:03:56.680> more<00:03:56.950> precise

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
was more work but that is a more precise

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.020 
was more work but that is a more precise
way<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:58.150> coat<00:03:58.360> each<00:03:58.629> strand<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:04.000> can

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
way to coat each strand you can

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.729 
way to coat each strand you can
literally<00:04:04.569> never<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:05.170> too<00:04:05.409> much<00:04:05.560> mayonnaise

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
literally never have too much mayonnaise

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.830 
literally never have too much mayonnaise
so<00:04:06.099> when<00:04:06.280> I'm<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.519> finished<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.030> still<00:04:07.329> grab

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
so when I'm all finished I still grab

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.180 
so when I'm all finished I still grab
some<00:04:08.079> more<00:04:08.230> mayonnaise<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.829> rake<00:04:08.980> that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
some more mayonnaise and rake that

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.360 
some more mayonnaise and rake that
through<00:04:09.459> as<00:04:09.640> well<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:13.560> like<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.620> put<00:04:14.859> all<00:04:15.069> my

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
hair at the top of my head because when

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.009 
hair at the top of my head because when
I<00:04:16.959> put<00:04:17.260> my<00:04:17.459> conditioning<00:04:18.459> cap<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.030> it's<00:04:19.359> easier

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
I put my conditioning cap on it's easier

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.810 
I put my conditioning cap on it's easier
and<00:04:20.320> then<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.590> shake<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.160> around<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.699> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and then I shake it around so that the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.330 
and then I shake it around so that the
hair<00:04:22.060> kind<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.300> falls<00:04:22.570> out<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:23.139> way<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.979> ends

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
hair kind of falls out that way the ends

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.250 
hair kind of falls out that way the ends
aren't<00:04:24.490> tucked<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:25.030> and<00:04:25.300> missing<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:25.930> heat

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.560 
aren't tucked in and missing the heat
that<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.710> generated<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.580> cap<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:28.060> can

forget<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.360> show<00:04:52.510> you<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:52.990> after<00:04:53.620> I've

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
forget to show you is that after I've

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.080 
forget to show you is that after I've
washed<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.099> mayonnaise<00:04:54.250> out<00:04:54.550> I<00:04:54.760> deep

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
washed the mayonnaise out I deep

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.850 
washed the mayonnaise out I deep
conditioned<00:04:55.630> it<00:04:55.750> because<00:04:56.020> once<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.680> put<00:04:56.830> all

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
conditioned it because once you put all

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
conditioned it because once you put all
that<00:04:57.070> protein<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.669> your<00:04:57.849> hair<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.240> kind<00:04:58.479> of

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
that protein on your hair it kind of

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.860 
that protein on your hair it kind of
feels<00:04:58.840> hard<00:04:59.320> and<00:05:00.300> tangled<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.449> stuff<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:01.810> you

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
feels hard and tangled and stuff so you

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.140 
feels hard and tangled and stuff so you
need<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.470> end<00:05:02.680> with<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:03.099> conditioner<00:05:03.789> or<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.940> deep

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
need to end with a conditioner or a deep

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.120 
need to end with a conditioner or a deep
conditioner<00:05:04.599> or<00:05:04.750> something<00:05:05.139> which<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.530> prefer

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
a deep conditioner because it makes my

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.040 
a deep conditioner because it makes my
hair<00:05:07.840> super<00:05:08.260> super<00:05:08.530> soft<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.070> also
