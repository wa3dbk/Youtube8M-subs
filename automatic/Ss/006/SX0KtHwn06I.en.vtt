00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's still slowing down quite a bit but

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.779

moving platforms this one's quite tricky
to<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:58.579> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.149> use<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.600> emulator<00:01:01.160> but<00:01:02.160> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to get if you use an emulator but it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.550 
to get if you use an emulator but it's
pretty<00:01:02.520> easy<00:01:03.710> all<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> gotta<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.250> that

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
pretty easy all you gotta do is that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.800

best way to get this one is do a long

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.280 
best way to get this one is do a long
jump<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.820> hopefully<00:01:14.820> you'll<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290
