00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.460 
project you will need scissors a piece
of<00:00:16.260> computer<00:00:16.680> paper<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.490> some<00:00:17.850> tape<00:00:21.470> all

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
of computer paper and some tape all

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.870 
of computer paper and some tape all
right<00:00:22.529> let's<00:00:22.830> begin<00:00:22.920> by<00:00:23.220> getting<00:00:23.550> out<00:00:23.760> our

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
right let's begin by getting out our

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
right let's begin by getting out our
piece<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> computer<00:00:24.630> paper<00:00:24.890> fold<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> in

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
piece of computer paper fold that in

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
piece of computer paper fold that in
half<00:00:26.420> increase<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.599> edge<00:00:27.949> next<00:00:28.949> you'll<00:00:29.099> be

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
half increase the edge next you'll be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
half increase the edge next you'll be
folding<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> other<00:00:29.910> opposite<00:00:30.449> two<00:00:30.599> edges

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
folding the other opposite two edges

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080 
folding the other opposite two edges
with<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:32.279> an<00:00:32.399> inch<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> bottom

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
with about an inch from the bottom

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.869 
with about an inch from the bottom
bottom<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:36.170> next<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.320> will<00:00:37.559> cut<00:00:38.399> off<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
bottom right next we will cut off that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.740 
bottom right next we will cut off that
folded<00:00:39.480> corner<00:00:39.840> head<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.340> then<00:00:41.340> open<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.850> cut

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
folded corner head and then open up cut

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
folded corner head and then open up cut
down<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> middle<00:00:44.239> very<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:46.010> alright<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.070> now

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
down the middle very good alright so now

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
down the middle very good alright so now
that<00:00:47.399> we've<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.820> half<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> sheet<00:00:48.870> you'll

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that we've got that half a sheet you'll

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.760 
that we've got that half a sheet you'll
start<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> hardest<00:00:51.840> part<00:00:51.960> start

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
start and this is the hardest part start

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
start and this is the hardest part start
very<00:00:53.100> slowly<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.910> beginning<00:00:54.210> try<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.230> get<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
very slowly the beginning try and get a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.569 
very slowly the beginning try and get a
tight<00:00:55.590> tight<00:00:55.860> cylinder<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> begin<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.280> roll

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
tight tight cylinder then begin to roll

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.540 
tight tight cylinder then begin to roll
towards<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> opposite<00:01:00.629> edge<00:01:01.039> making<00:01:02.039> sure<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
towards the opposite edge making sure to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.230 
towards the opposite edge making sure to
pull<00:01:03.300> away<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.500> outer<00:01:04.710> edge<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pull away from the outer edge to try and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
pull away from the outer edge to try and
tighten<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> cylinder<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tighten up that cylinder this is the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.429 
tighten up that cylinder this is the
slowest<00:01:09.030> process<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> hardest<00:01:10.320> part

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
slowest process this is the hardest part

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
slowest process this is the hardest part
and<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.310> practice<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.970 

if<00:01:16.420> at<00:01:16.600> any<00:01:16.750> point<00:01:16.810> in<00:01:17.080> this<00:01:17.140> how-to<00:01:17.350> video<00:01:17.680> you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
if at any point in this how-to video you

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.820 
if at any point in this how-to video you
are<00:01:18.010> lost<00:01:18.310> or<00:01:18.490> confused<00:01:19.110> simply<00:01:20.110> rewind<00:01:20.560> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
are lost or confused simply rewind and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.860 
are lost or confused simply rewind and
watch<00:01:21.160> again<00:01:26.100> alright<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.490> again<00:01:27.940> this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
watch again alright so again this is the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.070 
watch again alright so again this is the
longest<00:01:29.230> part<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.850> practice<00:01:31.300> you'll

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
longest part and with practice you'll

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.530 
longest part and with practice you'll
nail<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:35.880> alright<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:36.910> I'm<00:01:37.150> going<00:01:37.300> to<00:01:37.330> jump

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
nail it alright so I'm going to jump

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.560 
nail it alright so I'm going to jump
ahead<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.810> little<00:01:37.990> bit<00:01:38.110> here<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:39.450> once<00:01:40.450> you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
ahead a little bit here and once you

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.560 
ahead a little bit here and once you
have<00:01:40.690> it<00:01:40.780> nice<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.200> rolled<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:43.240> will<00:01:43.420> look

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
have it nice and rolled it will look

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.320 
have it nice and rolled it will look
something<00:01:43.780> like<00:01:43.990> this<00:01:44.350> so<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.060> want<00:01:46.270> to

bunting stick alright so you've got your

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.300 
bunting stick alright so you've got your
graphite<00:02:18.459> lay<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.820> out<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:20.950> looking

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
graphite lay it out but it's looking

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.780 
graphite lay it out but it's looking
choppy<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.870> not<00:02:23.140> good<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.620> use<00:02:24.610> our

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
choppy and that's not good so use our

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.790 
choppy and that's not good so use our
blending<00:02:25.150> stick<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.570> created<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.590> back

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
blending stick that we created go back
