00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
settled on a kind of simple version when

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
settled on a kind of simple version when
I<00:01:45.659> first<00:01:45.899> started<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.770> doing<00:01:47.100> all

I first started off I was doing all
these<00:01:47.399> highly<00:01:47.820> detailed<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.689> little

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
these highly detailed the little

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
highlights and so forth all over the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.440 
highlights and so forth all over the
eyes<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.979> stick<00:01:53.280> mainly<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:54.060> one

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
eyes now I kind of stick mainly with one

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.899 
eyes now I kind of stick mainly with one
good<00:01:54.810> highlight<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:56.159> right<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
good highlight like right here on the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
good highlight like right here on the
side<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> pupil<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
side get the pupil and get a kind of a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.899 
side get the pupil and get a kind of a
ring<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.680> darkened<00:02:01.680> ring<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:02.640> it's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
ring a darkened ring going around it's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.569 
ring a darkened ring going around it's
that<00:02:03.090> sort<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.420> lighter<00:02:03.990> area<00:02:04.619> between<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
that sort of lighter area between the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
that sort of lighter area between the
pupil<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.509> outer<00:02:06.689> ring<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> think

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
pupil and that outer ring that I think

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.089 
pupil and that outer ring that I think
gives<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.950> spooky<00:02:09.470> intense<00:02:10.470> look<00:02:10.860> that

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
gives it that spooky intense look that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.839 
gives it that spooky intense look that
I'm<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.250> for
