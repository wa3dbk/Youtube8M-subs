okay<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:01.829> what<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.310> have<00:00:02.490> here<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:04.940> lighting

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
okay so what we have here is a lighting

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay so what we have here is a lighting
control<00:00:06.240> module<00:00:06.629> off<00:00:06.779> hold<00:00:07.589> for<00:00:07.890> Crown

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
control module off hold for Crown

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.839 
control module off hold for Crown
Victoria<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.200> problem<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.849> this

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
Victoria and the problem is is that this

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.180 
Victoria and the problem is is that this
here<00:00:12.120> little<00:00:12.240> relay<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:12.990> that's<00:00:13.920> on

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
here little relay think that's on

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
here little relay think that's on
circuit<00:00:14.610> board<00:00:14.849> will<00:00:15.509> burn<00:00:16.440> out<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
circuit board will burn out and the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.429 
circuit board will burn out and the
problem<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.060> once<00:00:18.570> they<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.779> burns<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.199> then

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
problem and once they it burns out then

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
problem and once they it burns out then
you<00:00:19.619> won't<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.920> any<00:00:20.160> hot<00:00:20.400> any<00:00:20.609> headlights

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you won't have any hot any headlights

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.509 
you won't have any hot any headlights
high<00:00:21.300> beams<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.810> low<00:00:22.050> beams<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
high beams or low beams and this is a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.490 
high beams or low beams and this is a
police<00:00:24.029> interceptor<00:00:24.630> Crown<00:00:24.869> Vic<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> should

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
police interceptor Crown Vic I should

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.679 
police interceptor Crown Vic I should
clarify<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.250> right<00:00:26.580> away<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> does<00:00:27.570> not

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
clarify that right away and does not

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
clarify that right away and does not
have<00:00:27.900> auto<00:00:28.349> headlamps<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.550> don't<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.090> if

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
have auto headlamps so I don't know if

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
have auto headlamps so I don't know if
there's<00:00:30.300> any<00:00:30.449> difference<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.590> lighting

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
there's any difference in the lighting

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.139 
there's any difference in the lighting
control<00:00:32.460> module<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.880> have<00:00:32.969> auto

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
control module if you have auto

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.180 
control module if you have auto
headlamps<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.870> not<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.920> does<00:00:35.070> not

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
headlamps or not but this one does not

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
headlamps or not but this one does not
have<00:00:35.250> auto<00:00:35.550> headlamps<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
have auto headlamps so it's just a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.760 
have auto headlamps so it's just a
police<00:00:37.469> interceptor<00:00:38.070> Crown<00:00:38.399> Vic<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> anyways

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
police interceptor Crown Vic so anyways

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.240 
police interceptor Crown Vic so anyways
it's<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.780> relay<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.379> complex<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:44.040> burn

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it's a this relay the complex will burn

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
it's a this relay the complex will burn
out<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:45.840> seen<00:00:46.110> few<00:00:46.770> tips<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:48.289> splicing

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
out and I seen few tips on splicing

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.930 
out and I seen few tips on splicing
wires<00:00:49.469> into<00:00:50.010> your<00:00:50.399> connector<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.920> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
wires into your connector here and and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.580 
wires into your connector here and and
hardwiring<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.180> relay<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.989> wires<00:00:55.230> into

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
hardwiring a relay into your wires into

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
hardwiring a relay into your wires into
the<00:00:55.770> connectors<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.250> that'll<00:00:56.879> work<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the connectors and that'll work and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.880 
the connectors and that'll work and
there's<00:00:57.899> nothing<00:00:58.199> wrong<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.379> doing<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
there's nothing wrong with doing that

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.840 
there's nothing wrong with doing that
but<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.640> want<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.750> could

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
but what I want to do is see if I could

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.050 
but what I want to do is see if I could
run<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:02.969> external<00:01:03.329> relay<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.460> ran<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.640> harness

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
run an external relay I ran my harness

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520 
run an external relay I ran my harness
through<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> cover<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.020> broke<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
through the cover there I broke out a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.480 
through the cover there I broke out a
couple<00:01:07.890> events<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:09.299> hardwired<00:01:09.960> my

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
couple events and then hardwired my

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.760 
couple events and then hardwired my
actually<00:01:11.490> D<00:01:11.670> soldered<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.900> from<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
actually D soldered this here from the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980 
actually D soldered this here from the
circuit<00:01:14.130> board<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:15.090> soldered<00:01:15.509> my<00:01:15.689> wires

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
circuit board and then soldered my wires

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
circuit board and then soldered my wires
from<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.600> from<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.630> external<00:01:19.110> relay<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.740> place

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
from the from my external relay in place

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
from the from my external relay in place
of<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> relay<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.840> seems<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.320> too

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of this relay and that seems to work too

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
of this relay and that seems to work too
and<00:01:23.780> basically<00:01:24.890> push<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> wires<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
and basically push the wires through to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.080 
and basically push the wires through to
the<00:01:27.030> other<00:01:27.119> side<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> trick<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the other side now the trick to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
the other side now the trick to
desoldering<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.189> have<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.400> of

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
desoldering these here is have one of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.350 
desoldering these here is have one of
these<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.329> D<00:01:33.720> soldering<00:01:34.110> tool<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
these and this is a D soldering tool and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.960 
these and this is a D soldering tool and
what<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.110> vacuum<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.130> vacuum

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
what it is is it's vacuum that vacuum

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.109 
what it is is it's vacuum that vacuum
diaphragm<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> spring<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.700> what<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
diaphragm on a spring and what all you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
diaphragm on a spring and what all you
do<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> usually<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> backside<00:01:43.560> any<00:01:43.890> push

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
do is usually from the backside any push

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.910 
do is usually from the backside any push
through<00:01:45.110> component<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.439> goes<00:01:46.590> through<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
through component that goes through the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
through component that goes through the
circuit<00:01:47.280> board<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.360> surface<00:01:48.930> mount<00:01:49.170> one

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
circuit board or even surface mount one

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
circuit board or even surface mount one
it<00:01:49.740> works<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.159> two<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.210> heat<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> back

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it works on two but just heat the back

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
it works on two but just heat the back
side<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.229> pin<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.979> through<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
side of the pin that's going through and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.319 
side of the pin that's going through and
then<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.950> hit<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> hit<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.700> lever<00:01:56.909> here

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
then you just hit the hit the lever here

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.190 
then you just hit the hit the lever here
and<00:01:57.570> point<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.740> tip<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.490> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and point your tip here to the to the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.569 
and point your tip here to the to the
solder<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.829> soon<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.340> pull<00:02:02.549> your

solder as soon as you pull your

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.690 
solder as soon as you pull your
soldering<00:02:03.060> iron<00:02:03.119> away<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.860> thing<00:02:05.430> set

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
soldering iron away have this thing set

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.169 
soldering iron away have this thing set
and<00:02:06.090> hit<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> button<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.369> or<00:02:08.369> hit<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> lever

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and hit the button in or hit the lever

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.869 
and hit the button in or hit the lever
here<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.619> release<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.250> spring<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
here and it will release the spring and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.860 
here and it will release the spring and
that<00:02:12.780> creates<00:02:13.110> enough

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
that creates enough

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.610 
that creates enough
enough<00:02:15.870> vacuum<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:18.240> pull<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> solder<00:02:19.200> out<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
enough vacuum to pull the solder out and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.410 
enough vacuum to pull the solder out and
then<00:02:19.800> once<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.190> get<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.520> relay<00:02:20.880> once<00:02:21.240> you've

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
then once you get your relay once you've

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.680 
then once you get your relay once you've
decided<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.200> five<00:02:22.500> five<00:02:23.220> pins<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.300> relay

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
decided all five five pins of this relay

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.200 
decided all five five pins of this relay
heat<00:02:25.410> each<00:02:25.590> pull<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.490> more<00:02:26.670> time<00:02:26.880> as<00:02:27.030> your

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
heat each pull one more time as your

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.490 
heat each pull one more time as your
soldering<00:02:27.570> iron<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.990> then<00:02:28.110> while<00:02:28.350> you're

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
soldering iron and then while you're

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.100 
soldering iron and then while you're
heating<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.280> hit<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.120> hit<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> lever

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
heating it just hit the hit the lever

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.560 
heating it just hit the hit the lever
again<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.740> that<00:02:32.400> should<00:02:32.430> clear<00:02:33.000> any<00:02:33.240> solder

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
again and that should clear any solder

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.330 
again and that should clear any solder
out<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.020> hole<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.560> makes<00:02:34.770> mounting

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
out of the hole and that makes mounting

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.400 
out of the hole and that makes mounting
new<00:02:35.970> components<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:36.750> replacement<00:02:37.290> components

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
new components or replacement components

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.100 
new components or replacement components
or<00:02:37.890> if<00:02:37.980> you're<00:02:38.100> pushing<00:02:38.310> wires<00:02:38.640> through<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
circuit board to sock to solder and this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.720 
circuit board to sock to solder and this
here<00:02:42.480> makes<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.500> process<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.370> whole<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.550> easier

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
here makes a process a whole lot easier

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
here makes a process a whole lot easier
-<00:02:45.209> big<00:02:45.420> time-saver<00:02:45.890> versus<00:02:46.890> heating<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
- big time-saver versus heating and

trying to work the component back and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.530 
trying to work the component back and
forth<00:02:49.950> while<00:02:50.220> you're<00:02:50.400> hitting<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.240> with<00:02:51.390> your

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
forth while you're hitting it with your

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.540 
forth while you're hitting it with your
soldering<00:02:51.900> iron<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:55.190> pull<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> solder

soldering iron to just pull the solder

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.640 
soldering iron to just pull the solder
out<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.420> can<00:02:57.570> use<00:02:57.690> wicking<00:02:58.080> methods<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
out now you can use wicking methods a

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.610 
out now you can use wicking methods a
weak<00:02:59.540> desoldering<00:03:00.540> wick<00:03:00.630> will<00:03:01.020> work<00:03:01.170> too<00:03:01.410> but

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
weak desoldering wick will work too but

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
weak desoldering wick will work too but
I<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:02.070> kind<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.790> here<00:03:03.090> anyways

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
but I didn't know that till after I

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.320 
but I didn't know that till after I
looked<00:04:07.890> up<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> specs<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> relay<00:04:09.120> I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
looked up the specs on the relay I

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.289 
looked up the specs on the relay I
looked<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.780> up<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.250> digi-key<00:04:11.250> or<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.239> those

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
looked it up on digi-key or one of those

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.509 
looked it up on digi-key or one of those

them<00:04:14.820> really<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.870> NEC<00:04:16.200> relay<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.370> I'll

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
them really it's an NEC relay and I'll

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.599 
them really it's an NEC relay and I'll
put<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.209> numbers<00:04:18.510> there<00:04:18.750> -<00:04:19.019> if<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.130> look<00:04:20.280> -<00:04:20.459> if

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
put the numbers there - if you look - if

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.730 
put the numbers there - if you look - if

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
may as well just replace the relay as

work<00:04:33.520> anyways<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.480> fix<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.440> car<00:04:35.650> that

way<00:04:36.010> but<00:04:36.220> since<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.640> don't<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:37.120> many<00:04:37.300> I

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
way but since I don't do that many I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.120 
way but since I don't do that many I
would<00:04:37.480> I<00:04:37.750> figure<00:04:38.260> this<00:04:38.440> here<00:04:38.620> was<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.770> workflow

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
would I figure this here was a workflow

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.910 
would I figure this here was a workflow
method<00:04:39.640> uh<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:40.020> relay<00:04:41.020> harness<00:04:41.200> like<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.740> is

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
method uh I relay harness like this is

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.890 
method uh I relay harness like this is
about<00:04:42.100> ten<00:04:42.370> bucks<00:04:42.610> or<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.510> it's<00:04:43.660> still<00:04:43.870> a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
about ten bucks or so so it's still a

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.260 
about ten bucks or so so it's still a
lot<00:04:44.050> cheaper<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:45.010> do<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.580> repair<00:04:46.060> takes

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
lot cheaper to do this this repair takes

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.710 
lot cheaper to do this this repair takes
about<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.570> half<00:04:46.630> hour<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.670> then<00:04:48.670> buying<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.180> 300

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
about a half hour so then buying a 300

repair and we tested it here for about
an<00:05:18.910> hour<00:05:18.970> or<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.510> everything<00:05:19.780> seems<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.320> be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
an hour or so and everything seems to be

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.380 
an hour or so and everything seems to be
work<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.860> find<00:05:21.100> this<00:05:21.610> relay<00:05:21.970> doesn't<00:05:22.240> click

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
work and find this relay doesn't click

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.460 
work and find this relay doesn't click
on<00:05:22.540> and<00:05:22.720> off<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.960> you<00:05:23.020> turn<00:05:23.200> your<00:05:23.320> headlights

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
on and off to you turn your headlights

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.100 
on and off to you turn your headlights
on<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.820> high<00:05:24.940> beam<00:05:25.180> control<00:05:25.420> is<00:05:25.780> actually

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
on and the high beam control is actually

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.730 
on and the high beam control is actually
in<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.260> multi-function<00:05:26.980> switch<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:28.470> our<00:05:29.470> least

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
in a multi-function switch so our least

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.530 
in a multi-function switch so our least
appears<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.220> me<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.340> be<00:05:30.430> I<00:05:30.520> have<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.150> look<00:05:31.300> again

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
appears to me to be I have to look again

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.690 
appears to me to be I have to look again
at<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.780> wiring<00:05:31.960> diagram<00:05:32.530> but<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:32.980> didn't<00:05:33.610> hear

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
at the wiring diagram but I didn't hear

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.580 
at the wiring diagram but I didn't hear
anything<00:05:33.910> clicking<00:05:34.420> in<00:05:34.600> there<00:05:35.140> when<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.410> was

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
anything clicking in there when I was

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.860 
anything clicking in there when I was

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
hitting the high beams and high beams

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.860 
hitting the high beams and high beams
and<00:05:38.050> low<00:05:38.140> beams<00:05:38.290> do<00:05:38.830> work<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:39.720> headlights

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870

you'll<00:05:41.170> hear<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.560> relay<00:05:41.860> here<00:05:42.130> click<00:05:42.490> when

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
you'll hear the relay here click when

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.820 
you'll hear the relay here click when
you<00:05:43.390> go<00:05:43.630> from<00:05:43.810> your<00:05:43.990> park<00:05:44.200> lamps<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.710> your

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
you go from your park lamps to your

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.860 
you go from your park lamps to your
headlamps<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:45.400> that's<00:05:45.610> when<00:05:45.850> your<00:05:46.030> that's

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
headlamps so that's when your that's

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.350 
headlamps so that's when your that's
when<00:05:47.050> your<00:05:47.260> relay<00:05:47.560> becomes<00:05:47.920> energized<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:49.090> I

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
when your relay becomes energized so I

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.120 
when your relay becomes energized so I
guess<00:05:49.900> that's<00:05:50.080> about<00:05:50.170> it<00:05:50.290> it's<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.740> fairly

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
guess that's about it it's a fairly

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.190 
guess that's about it it's a fairly
simple<00:05:51.490> repair<00:05:52.030> I<00:05:52.210> don't<00:05:52.540> know<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.660> used<00:05:53.140> to
