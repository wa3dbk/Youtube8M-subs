top<00:00:42.070> side<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.400> one<00:00:42.790> bolt<00:00:43.030> head<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:44.080> the

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
top side of one bolt head and on the

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.820 
top side of one bolt head and on the
bottom<00:00:44.530> side<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:44.890> other<00:00:44.980> bolt<00:00:45.280> head<00:00:46.830> and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
bottom side of the other bolt head and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:01:02.850 
bottom side of the other bolt head and
it<00:00:47.950> braces<00:00:48.160> them<00:00:48.460> pretty<00:00:48.790> good<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.680> now

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
it braces them pretty good and now

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.560 
it braces them pretty good and now
they're<00:01:03.070> all<00:01:03.160> broke<00:01:03.430> loose<00:01:03.460> I'm<00:01:04.030> just<00:01:04.330> going

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
they're all broke loose I'm just going

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.920 
they're all broke loose I'm just going
to<00:01:04.770> by<00:01:05.770> hand<00:01:06.100> remove<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.790> four<00:01:07.150> bolts<00:01:07.479> for<00:01:07.900> the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
to by hand remove the four bolts for the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:17.880 
to by hand remove the four bolts for the
pulley<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.450> sometimes<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:17.320> pulley<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.740> be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
pulley so sometimes this pulley can be

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.010 
pulley so sometimes this pulley can be
really<00:01:18.220> hard<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.520> get<00:01:18.670> off<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.850> here<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.750> you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
really hard to get off of here so you

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.590 
really hard to get off of here so you
might<00:01:20.200> need<00:01:20.350> some<00:01:20.530> extra<00:01:20.860> force<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.460> you<00:01:22.450> just

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
might need some extra force and you just

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.219 
might need some extra force and you just
put<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.900> right<00:01:22.930> there<00:01:23.440> at<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.650> top<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.330> pry<00:01:26.170> it

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
put it right there at the top and pry it

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.030 
put it right there at the top and pry it
off<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:31.420> we're<00:01:31.630> gonna<00:01:31.720> put<00:01:32.050> our<00:01:32.229> pulley<00:01:32.770> back

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
off now we're gonna put our pulley back

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.130 
off now we're gonna put our pulley back
on<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.550> slides<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.990> you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
on and it just slides on like that you

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.980 
on and it just slides on like that you
want<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.320> make<00:01:38.440> sure<00:01:38.620> that<00:01:38.800> it<00:01:39.360> goes<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.720> like

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
want to make sure that it goes in like

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
want to make sure that it goes in like
that<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.890> means<00:01:42.040> it's<00:01:42.220> properly<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.820> place<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that it means it's properly in place and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.860 
that it means it's properly in place and
then<00:01:46.740> kind<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.830> feel<00:01:48.040> around<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.760> turn<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.750> to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
then kind of feel around and turn it to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.590 
then kind of feel around and turn it to
try<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.110> find<00:01:50.350> those<00:01:50.530> holes<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:52.120> hand
