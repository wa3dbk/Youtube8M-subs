00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 they crossed the heavens but that's not 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.440
 was that for a brief moment peter pan did 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.870
 I had not seen them coming 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.139
 weirdest flying in history 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.080
 the pet top 5 flying machines and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.510
 weirdest in the history of everything 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 time the man had a dream fly away 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 among the clouds steal a dream that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 since the legend icaro sketch of 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.710
 Leonardo da Vinci has always seemed 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.050
 impossible but everything changed in 1783 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 thanks to the hot-air balloon brothers and their 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.290
 balloons of the same name since the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.149
 technology has only continued its 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.010
 road to get to our days or 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.809
 cross the wall of the lesson several times or 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.579
 still go into space is no longer a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.230
 problem but all this did not happen 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.620
 as if on wheels or rather 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.420
 men 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.250
 yeah indeed there are some 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 little mishaps and quirks between 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 sometimes failed times sometimes succeeded 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.780
 sometimes strange sometimes really 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.039
 strange 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.899
 that's what we're going to see 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.780
 today at this top of the machines 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 weirdest flying in history 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 is in 5 the airbus a300 shoot 600 east 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450
 and you're wondering surely if what 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 you're seeing right now on your screen has 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 been faked or is a prototype 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 and no, because I myself 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 the question 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.020
 the airbus a300 600 and stehlik also known 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 under the beluga name or super 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 carrier and the biggest plane 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.990
 cargo ship of the world offering the largest 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.430
 carrying capacity of all planes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 military or civilian in service 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 currently his hold is about 37 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.659
 meters and a half long for a diameter 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.369
 7 24 5 copies of the beluga were 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.560
 built and are currently used 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.590
 by its unique client and creators 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 airbus international transport for the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 transport two other sections 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 airbus devices between different 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.820
 production sites in europe as well as 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.259
 for the transport of loads 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 exceptional situations such as 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.700
 spacecraft satellites of the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.829
 military vehicles or 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.450
 humanitarian operations sarr and you 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.640
 you are probably wondering where this device 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.500
 its name is well this device must 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.689
 this beluga name in its likeness 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.390
 striking with the silhouette of the Cretaceous 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.429
 of the same name the beluga or more differently 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.859
 called the white whale 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.349
 to the four local run or the gyroplane 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.750
 I do not know the auto manages or the ancestor 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.450
 two helicopters was invented in 1923 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.549
 by a Spanish engineer named Juan 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.840
 syrah its first three appliances 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.670
 lack of stability 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.379
 they bowed too much to takeoff and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.930
 break their pale but his fourth 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.639
 design the car besides its 19 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.290
 was a lot more prototype 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.750
 perfected he was put in 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.060
 demonstration in 1925 in England 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.230
 in front of a group of officers the group 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.090
 officers was also strong 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.709
 impressed by the craft which allowed 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.510
 to continue to perfect this one 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.470
 afterwards to give what we 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.879
 know today as 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.349
 the helicopter number 3 the case m nicknamed 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.599
 the monster of the Caspian Sea 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.280
 the calm was one and crasnault plane yes 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.200
 it says like that an airplane designed to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.700
 fly with the ground effect a few 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.010
 meters only above the sea 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.329
 so he could easily resist 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.969
 waves 5 meters high 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.400
 but following a steering error this 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:09.719
 giant of 100 meters for a weight of 550 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.280
 tons went extinct in 1981 after 14 years 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.379
 good and loyal services for 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.680
 scientific scientists who are 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.959
 served as a flying laboratory 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.510
 number two at showcases where lots 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.669
 blick is blick also called l 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.530
 sweeping is a concept of the 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.510
 geometry variable team i on a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.019
 aircraft the ale is designed to turn on 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.060
 pivot 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.500
 indeed by changing the angle of 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.659
 sweep of this one one can 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.250
 theoretically reduce the drag of 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.810
 the high speed plane without for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.099
 as much sacrificing his performances to 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.389
 low speed 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.769
 the oldest example of this 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.159
 technology are aircraft projects 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.989
 gevo global German ones from 1944 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.549
 but it's only about thirty years 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.879
 later that prototypes saw the 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.799
 day 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.169
 indeed so far only one 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.359
 aircraft was piloted it was done by 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.790
 nasa to explore the concept he has 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.699
 stole a series of tests from 79 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.239
 and various experimentation permits on 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.849
 Aviation 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.280
 but these have unfortunately not succeeded 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.060
 favorably number one 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.310
 the lawyer nada bz 9 adro car or more 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.680
 simply the avro car is an aircraft from 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.940
 adav type as we say in secret by the 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.350
 US government in the 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.930
 first years of the cold war 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.389
 the first flight to if we can say place 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.919
 November 12, 1959 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.960
 inspired by the fear of saucers 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.910
 flying assanvo that at that time and 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.889
 also in my humble opinion of the enbrel to a 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.050
 even weird and from 1907 that it is 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.330
 two aircraft were built on 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.760
 second prototype with a diameter of 5 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.250
 meters and a half accumulated the 75 hours of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.200
 theft but could never rise to more than 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.390
 one meter in height the fault to 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.190
 stability problems insurmountable the 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.530
 program will eventually be abandoned in 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.000
 December 61 after three years of 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.180
 research and millions of dollars 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.780
 invested at the expense of the taxpayer well 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.780
 obviously
