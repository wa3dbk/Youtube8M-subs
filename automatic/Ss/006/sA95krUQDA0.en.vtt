00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.639
 and then all his teammates are no longer 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:20.030
 understand what happens if you don’t 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:22.370
 noticed will show again sure this 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.880
 moment three people asked the same 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.180
 question 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 what for tries about and I absolutely understand them 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.250
 because at this moment more care 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.560
 not that they communicate in the report but how 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.480
 and tags could not find steam if they 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.340
 google do not know how to use to 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.210
 learn through what you can communicate in order not to 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 distract others 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 and of course how strong 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.310
 will have to break the forehead depending on all that they are 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.310
 are doing 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:01:01.700
 so my fucking sakuya just 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:04.880
 randomly purchased at this moment 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.710
 should they have something to click let 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.130
 from the tinker's boots at the same time 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.600
 midu 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:46.930
 goodbye anyone would understand them did not 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:51.350
 so at least someone 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.240
 it doesn’t bother you 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.730
 the eyes of the software for sure 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.760
 he is aware of two minutes or writes with 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.760
 mistakes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 but then even less appears 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 meaning therefore by the prize where only 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 that killed your friend well now you 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.730

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.660
 5k mm 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:42.500
 it is he who is so great and gay not only 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:44.420
 there could be extra money there 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.690
 they are out of their minds 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.530
 Blue glazik very cute looks 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.989
 in inventory 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.099
 choosing at its discretion here everything 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.250
 options are good I'm giving it shorter 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.340
 all the same here let's the shaman sell them 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.340
 behind 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.890
 I will not accept age 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:15.840
 believe me 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
 thank 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.160
 first soul ring in situations like this 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:04:14.569
 oh how come so therefore him and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:04:16.790
 collected secondly you understand whether i'm on 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.400
 the place the chickens would go merged and more 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.250
 never revived not to listen 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.010
 This is the first time a tinker plays. 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.620
 13 minutes should be the grass la coppa 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.840
 going through the stump-deck but shipping 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.419
 things are the weirdest of all 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.950
 the above sure put before 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:40.479
 a task to choose the most terrible 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.479
 Making a choice will fall for 1 bidder 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:05.050
 why our guide on low priority everything 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.440
 comments go voys chat surprised 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.560
 some kind of crap are equally good only 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.700
 you also move to the head between Look 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:21.090
 on my transport well, what to see and what 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:23.980
 I looked up train locomotive and why 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.240
 rivals have no teamwork and 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.240
 in addition claw 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.639
 why 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.410
 and tinker just disgusts me 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:03.960
 as you can understand at once for two reasons 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.689
 his coins poorat me in this case 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.419
 annoy so much more than that 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.419
 he yells do you have a friend who 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.540
 such a professional that already noob on 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.540
 creeping frags and no sense 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.209
 here 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.190
 searched 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.410
 all the canons of poor guides moved 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.080
 gayzer 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.690
 his friend is a fool poured teammates yell 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.699
 and bear nonsense at some point I already 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:02.090
 hoped we would finally call 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.400
 satan and it will all end but no steel 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.470
 frags and losing opponent 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.620
 double mid with accusations 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.240
 teammates and a lot of boredom that's all 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.250
 there is no 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.250
 absolutely nothing to do with the guide 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.250
 good luck
