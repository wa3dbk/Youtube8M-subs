00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you can put on them these are crystal

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.950 
you can put on them these are crystal
rondelle's<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.029> are<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> metal

rondelle's and what they are is a metal

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.980 
rondelle's and what they are is a metal
piece<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.260> has<00:00:22.910> faceted<00:00:23.910> crystals<00:00:24.359> set<00:00:24.600> into

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
piece that has faceted crystals set into

piece that has faceted crystals set into
the<00:00:25.109> side<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.529> they're<00:00:25.650> kind<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> channels<00:00:26.279> set

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
there and you actually use that as a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
there and you actually use that as a
bead<00:00:28.680> spacer<00:00:29.400> between<00:00:29.849> other<00:00:30.150> types<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> beads

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990

bead spacer between other types of beads
and<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.590> use<00:00:31.710> them<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.009> anything<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
millimeter so I used a slightly larger

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.200 
millimeter so I used a slightly larger
rondell<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.559> bracelet<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.370> chose<00:00:53.879> six

gifts for bridesmaids and bridal parties
so<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> way<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.790> make

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
so the way that you do it as you make

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.490 
so the way that you do it as you make
the<00:01:12.119> bracelet<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.689> long<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the bracelet as long as you want to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
the bracelet as long as you want to
seven<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> half<00:01:14.070> inches<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> standard

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
seven and a half inches as a standard

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.690 
seven and a half inches as a standard
length<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.680> recommend<00:01:16.979> leaving<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
length and I recommend leaving the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850 
length and I recommend leaving the
stretchy<00:01:17.939> cord<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> spool<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.680> as

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
stretchy cord on the spool so that as

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.160 
stretchy cord on the spool so that as
you're<00:01:20.130> threading<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.600> start<00:01:21.960> out

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you're threading it on you start out

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
you're threading it on you start out
with<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> rondell<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.820> normally<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with the rondell now normally you would

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.600 
with the rondell now normally you would
think<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:24.900> tying<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.890> knot<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> back

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think about tying the knot in the back

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.370 
think about tying the knot in the back
of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> bracelet<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.840> case<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
of the bracelet but in this case the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.109 
of the bracelet but in this case the
hole<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> rondell<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:30.000> bit

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
hole on the rondell is a little bit

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.640 
hole on the rondell is a little bit
bigger<00:01:30.299> than<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> pearls<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.439> knot<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
bigger than the pearls so your knot is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.179 
bigger than the pearls so your knot is
actually<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.610> hidden<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> front

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
actually going to be hidden in the front

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.859 
actually going to be hidden in the front
so<00:01:35.189> I'll<00:01:35.280> go<00:01:35.400> ahead<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.700> trim<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.000> end<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so I'll go ahead and trim this end and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.550 
so I'll go ahead and trim this end and
then<00:01:37.860> tie<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.310> knot<00:01:38.479> now<00:01:39.479> tips<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.350> tying

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then tie my knot now tips for tying

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.380 
then tie my knot now tips for tying
knots<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.280> stretchy<00:01:41.670> cord<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
knots and stretchy cord it can be a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
knots and stretchy cord it can be a
little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.750> tricky<00:01:43.049> because<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
little bit tricky because it's kind of

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.179 
little bit tricky because it's kind of
slippery

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
slippery

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
slippery
so<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.939> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.659> square<00:01:45.930> knot<00:01:45.990> which

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
so you want to make a square knot which

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.100 
so you want to make a square knot which
is<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> other<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> did

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
is just one side over the other so I did

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.859 
is just one side over the other so I did
right<00:01:49.320> over<00:01:49.350> left<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:51.060> I'll<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.390> back<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
right over left and now I'll go back the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.730 
right over left and now I'll go back the
other<00:01:51.899> way<00:01:52.799> left<00:01:53.100> over<00:01:53.460> right<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.530> I'm<00:01:55.530> going

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
other way left over right and I'm going

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
other way left over right and I'm going
to<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> second<00:01:56.759> wrap<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:57.960> one<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to do a second wrap so there's one and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.580 
to do a second wrap so there's one and
then<00:01:59.490> I'll<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.759> another<00:02:00.079> where<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> pass<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
then I'll do another where I pass it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
then I'll do another where I pass it
through<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> loop<00:02:02.040> again<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.420> called

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
through the loop again so that's called

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
through the loop again so that's called
a<00:02:03.780> surgeon's<00:02:04.259> knot<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> tie<00:02:05.969> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
a surgeon's knot and when you tie it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
a surgeon's knot and when you tie it
that<00:02:07.079> makes<00:02:07.259> your<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.799> nice<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that makes your not really nice and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.510 
that makes your not really nice and
tight<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> Snug<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.110> down

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
tight and you want to Snug this all down

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.350 
tight and you want to Snug this all down
so<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.849> good<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.599> tight

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
so that it's good and tight

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360 
so that it's good and tight
and<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.780> pull<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.710> little<00:02:14.740> bit<00:02:15.070> give<00:02:15.340> it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and you can pull it a little bit give it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.160 
and you can pull it a little bit give it
some<00:02:15.610> tension<00:02:16.030> see<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.540> knot<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.750> tight

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
some tension see if your knot is tight

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.740 
some tension see if your knot is tight
enough<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.950> isn't<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.210> hold<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.660> in

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
enough if it isn't you can hold it in

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.730 
enough if it isn't you can hold it in
both<00:02:20.200> hands<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:21.160> pull<00:02:21.960> all<00:02:22.960> four

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
both hands and then pull all four

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.100 
both hands and then pull all four
directions<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.580> you're<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.150> pulling

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
directions so you're kind of pulling

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.970 
directions so you're kind of pulling
while<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:27.250> adjust<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.210> knot<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:29.890> of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
while you adjust the knot so you kind of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.460 
while you adjust the knot so you kind of
stretch<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.730> give<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:30.940> some<00:02:31.210> tension<00:02:31.660> okay

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
stretch it and give it some tension okay

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.260 
stretch it and give it some tension okay
now<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.010> next<00:02:33.040> step<00:02:33.460> is<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:33.640> important

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
now the next step is really important

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.880 
now the next step is really important
you'll<00:02:34.420> want<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.630> add<00:02:34.780> some<00:02:35.080> jeweler<00:02:35.470> cement

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
you'll want to add some jeweler cement

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.160 
you'll want to add some jeweler cement
some<00:02:36.220> speed<00:02:36.610> stringing<00:02:37.000> glue<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.840> here<00:02:38.050> on

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
some speed stringing glue right here on

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.020 
some speed stringing glue right here on
the<00:02:38.290> knot<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.710> then<00:02:38.890> set<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.370> aside<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.880> dry

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
the knot and then set this aside to dry

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.660 
the knot and then set this aside to dry
until<00:02:40.330> your<00:02:40.600> glue<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.870> completely<00:02:41.080> cured<00:02:41.980> now

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
until your glue is completely cured now

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.210 
until your glue is completely cured now
don't<00:02:42.970> use<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.590> cyanoacrylate<00:02:44.590> glue<00:02:44.620> because

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
don't use a cyanoacrylate glue because

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.100 
don't use a cyanoacrylate glue because
that<00:02:45.459> can<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:45.880> brittle<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.390> stiff<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.900> cause

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that can get brittle and stiff and cause

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
that can get brittle and stiff and cause
your<00:02:47.260> bracelet<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> break<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.670> make<00:02:48.880> sure<00:02:48.910> that

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
your bracelet to break so make sure that

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.600 
your bracelet to break so make sure that
it's<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.420> glue<00:02:49.600> that<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> flexible<00:02:50.440> bond<00:02:50.680> now

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
it's a glue that has a flexible bond now

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.699 
it's a glue that has a flexible bond now
you'll<00:02:51.790> come<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.300> end<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.840> you'll<00:02:53.530> just

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
you'll come to the end and you'll just

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.620 
you'll come to the end and you'll just
use<00:02:53.980> your<00:02:54.160> wire<00:02:54.340> cutters<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:55.030> get<00:02:55.360> really

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
use your wire cutters to get really

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.720 
use your wire cutters to get really
close<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.110> knot<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.620> trim<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.580> ends

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
close to the knot and trim the ends

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.060 
close to the knot and trim the ends
that's<00:02:58.180> after<00:02:58.420> your<00:02:58.600> glue<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.989> dry<00:02:59.230> so<00:02:59.920> those

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
that's after your glue is dry so those

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.570 
that's after your glue is dry so those
are<00:03:00.220> some<00:03:00.370> tips<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.850> stretchy<00:03:01.120> bracelet
