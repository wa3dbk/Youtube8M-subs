the other side of the tree we got had

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
the other side of the tree we got had
bronze<00:00:31.349> armor<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.009> we're<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> shoot

arrows at each other until we die but

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
arrows at each other until we die but
I've<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.700> feeling<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.809> us<00:00:36.899> are

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
I've got that feeling that one of us are

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
I've got that feeling that one of us are
selected<00:00:37.500> though<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.860> fast<00:00:38.160> yeah

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
selected though really fast yeah

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.260 
selected though really fast yeah
probably<00:00:39.620> considering<00:00:40.620> where<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> 80<00:00:41.850> stories

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
probably considering where I 80 stories

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.869 
probably considering where I 80 stories
off<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> ground<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.030> tree

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
off the ground so get on to your tree

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.170 
off the ground so get on to your tree
problem<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.129> start<00:00:50.460> falling<00:00:50.910> down

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
problem is you can start falling down

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.850 
problem is you can start falling down
and<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:52.949> be<00:00:53.300> odd<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.719> our<00:00:55.079> creative<00:00:55.590> mind

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and it would be odd on our creative mind

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.680 
and it would be odd on our creative mind
and<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:57.000> scared<00:00:57.440> okay<00:00:58.440> um<00:00:59.329> we're<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.510> need
