hey<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.840> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.350> tutorial<00:00:01.560> I'm<00:00:02.100> going<00:00:02.129> to

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey guys in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey guys in this tutorial I'm going to
be<00:00:02.520> explained<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.270> what<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.140> binary

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
be explained to you what the binary

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.460 
be explained to you what the binary
number<00:00:04.799> system<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.580> how<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.240> works<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:07.200> if

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
number system is and how it works so if

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.350 
number system is and how it works so if
you<00:00:07.589> don't<00:00:07.799> know<00:00:07.919> already<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.610> binary<00:00:09.030> number

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
you don't know already the binary number

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.509 
you don't know already the binary number
system<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> number<00:00:10.230> system<00:00:10.590> based<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.130> two

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
system is a number system based on two

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.330 
system is a number system based on two
so<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.360> means<00:00:12.660> that<00:00:12.780> each<00:00:13.170> digit<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.799> binary

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
so that means that each digit in binary

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.700 
so that means that each digit in binary
can<00:00:14.580> only<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.940> either<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.599> or<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.900> zero<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
can only be either a one or a zero and

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830 
can only be either a one or a zero and
that<00:00:17.490> means<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.850> no<00:00:18.150> matter<00:00:18.180> what<00:00:18.630> number

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
that means that no matter what number

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
that means that no matter what number
we're<00:00:19.140> trying<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.529> represent<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.160> binary<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
we're trying to represent in binary it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.929 
we're trying to represent in binary it
can<00:00:21.270> only<00:00:21.510> be<00:00:21.869> ones<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> zeros<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.640> let<00:00:23.850> me

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
can only be ones and zeros so let me

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.250 
can only be ones and zeros so let me
just<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.210> ahead<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> show<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
just go ahead and show you how to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
just go ahead and show you how to
convert<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> binary<00:00:26.250> number<00:00:26.789> into<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.240> decimal

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
convert a binary number into a decimal

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.870 
convert a binary number into a decimal
number<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> decimal

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
number and if you don't know a decimal

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.310 
number and if you don't know a decimal
is<00:00:30.090> that's<00:00:30.420> basically<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> number

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
is that's basically just the number

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040 
is that's basically just the number
system<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:32.070> used<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:33.149> 1<00:00:33.450> 2<00:00:33.660> 3<00:00:33.690> 4

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
system that we're used to like 1 2 3 4

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.100 
system that we're used to like 1 2 3 4
and<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.969> alright<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.480> paint<00:00:36.809> here<00:00:37.079> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
and so on alright so in paint here I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
and so on alright so in paint here I
just<00:00:37.410> drew<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> binary<00:00:38.399> number<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.450> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
just drew out a binary number so here we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
just drew out a binary number so here we
have<00:00:39.570> 0<00:00:40.110> 1<00:00:40.530> 0<00:00:40.829> 0<00:00:41.160> 0<00:00:41.550> 1<00:00:42.540> 1<00:00:42.870> 1<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.219> eight

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
have 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 so we have eight

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.630 
have 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 so we have eight
bits<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.829> basically

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
bits right here and a bit is basically

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.090 
bits right here and a bit is basically
just<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:48.629> binary<00:00:49.140> digits<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
just one of these binary digits so this

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
just one of these binary digits so this
is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> bit<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.719> bit<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
is a bit this is a bit this is a bit and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.709 
is a bit this is a bit this is a bit and
so<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.489> alright<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.910> let's<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.480> say<00:00:54.600> we

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so on alright so let's just say we

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
so on alright so let's just say we
wanted<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> convert<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.710> into<00:00:55.920> decimal<00:00:56.670> or

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
wanted to convert this into decimal or

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
wanted to convert this into decimal or
our<00:00:57.360> number<00:00:57.870> system<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
our number system well what I'm going to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.639 
our number system well what I'm going to
do<00:00:59.640> here<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.180> start<00:01:00.570> off<00:01:00.690> by<00:01:00.960> writing<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.379> 1

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
do here is just start off by writing a 1

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.500 
do here is just start off by writing a 1
under<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.250> number<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.090> under<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
under this number a two under this

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.800 
under this number a two under this
number<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.080> 4a<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.600> gonna<00:01:06.689> do

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
number of 4a and so on so I'm gonna do

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:16.399 
number of 4a and so on so I'm gonna do
16<00:01:07.520> 32<00:01:10.040> 64<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.960> 128<00:01:14.659> alright<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.900> basically

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
16 32 64 and 128 alright so basically

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.649 
16 32 64 and 128 alright so basically
what<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:17.040> right<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.450> keep

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
what we do right here is we just keep

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.840 
what we do right here is we just keep
multiplying<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.560> 2<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:20.490> start<00:01:20.700> off

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
multiplying this by 2 so we start off

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
multiplying this by 2 so we start off
with<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.810> multiply<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.409> by<00:01:22.470> two<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.130> get

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
with one we multiply that by two we get

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.480 
with one we multiply that by two we get
to<00:01:23.490> multiply<00:01:24.210> two<00:01:24.270> by<00:01:24.630> two<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.560> four<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to multiply two by two we get four then

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.569 
to multiply two by two we get four then
we<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> 16<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.520> does

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
we get a and 16 and so on now how does

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
we get a and 16 and so on now how does
this<00:01:29.820> relate<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.829> converting<00:01:31.829> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
this relate to actually converting this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
this relate to actually converting this
binary<00:01:32.159> number<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.790> decimal<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.720> let<00:01:33.990> me

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
binary number into decimal well let me

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
binary number into decimal well let me
just<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.259> ahead<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> show<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> since<00:01:36.540> this

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just go ahead and show you so since this

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
just go ahead and show you so since this
number<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.470> right<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.950> we're<00:01:38.430> going

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
number is a one right here we're going

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
number is a one right here we're going
to<00:01:38.729> count<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.509> count<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.740> I'm

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
to count it so we count this one so I'm

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.840 
to count it so we count this one so I'm
just<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.220> ahead<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> write<00:01:41.640> down

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just going to go ahead and write down

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.929 
just going to go ahead and write down
one<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.340> well<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
one right there this is a one as well so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
one right there this is a one as well so
I'm<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.390> ahead<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.840> add<00:01:46.380> two

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
I'm just going to go ahead and add two

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.120 
I'm just going to go ahead and add two
to<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.460> one<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
to that one this is a one right here so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.929 
to that one this is a one right here so
we<00:01:50.250> count<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.700> is

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
we count this for so we had for this is

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.389 
we count this for so we had for this is
a<00:01:53.970> zero<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.659> don't<00:01:54.899> count<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> eight<00:01:55.560> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
a zero so we don't count the eight this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.789 
a zero so we don't count the eight this
is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> zero<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.600> count<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> 16<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
is a zero so we don't count the 16 this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.069 
is a zero so we don't count the 16 this
is<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> zero<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.729> count<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> 32<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
is a zero so we don't count the 32 but

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.319 
is a zero so we don't count the 32 but
this<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.009> 1<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this right here is a 1 so we're going to

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.780 
this right here is a 1 so we're going to
go<00:02:03.360> ahead<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.840> count<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.320> 64<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
go ahead and count this 64 right here so

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.779 
go ahead and count this 64 right here so
let<00:02:05.909> me<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.210> ahead<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> add<00:02:07.009> 64<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
let me just go ahead and add 64 to this

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
let me just go ahead and add 64 to this
and<00:02:09.060> as<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.959> last<00:02:10.289> digit<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> a0

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and as we can see this last digit is a0

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.470 
and as we can see this last digit is a0
as<00:02:11.370> well<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
as well so we

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.890 
as well so we
count<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> 128<00:02:13.769> all<00:02:14.610> right<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.480> were<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
count the 128 all right now I were to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
count the 128 all right now I were to
add<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.379> these<00:02:16.709> numbers<00:02:16.950> together<00:02:17.250> they

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
add all these numbers together they

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
add all these numbers together they
would<00:02:18.330> add<00:02:18.540> up<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:19.019> what<00:02:19.319> this<00:02:19.470> binary<00:02:19.739> number

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
would add up to what this binary number

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.820 
would add up to what this binary number
represents<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.049> let<00:02:22.260> me<00:02:22.349> just<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:22.530> ahead<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
represents so let me just go ahead and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.860 
represents so let me just go ahead and
open<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.580> calculator<00:02:24.209> right<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
open up the calculator right here and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.250 
open up the calculator right here and
add<00:02:25.500> together<00:02:25.739> these<00:02:26.370> four<00:02:26.970> numbers<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.900> one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
add together these four numbers so one

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.070 
add together these four numbers so one
plus<00:02:28.650> two<00:02:29.280> plus<00:02:30.470> four<00:02:31.549> plus<00:02:33.230> 64<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:35.160> get<00:02:35.310> 71

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
plus two plus four plus 64 and we get 71

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.750 
plus two plus four plus 64 and we get 71
so<00:02:37.160> 71<00:02:38.810> looks<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.049> this<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.650> binary<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.519> how

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
so 71 looks like this in binary and how

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.789 
so 71 looks like this in binary and how
can<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.150> sure<00:02:42.180> we're<00:02:42.569> right<00:02:42.780> well<00:02:43.530> while

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
can we be sure we're right well while

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.410 
can we be sure we're right well while
you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.519> go<00:02:44.579> in<00:02:44.790> your<00:02:44.910> calculator

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you can do we just go in your calculator

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.400 
you can do we just go in your calculator
and<00:02:45.690> change<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.079> view<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.519> programmer<00:02:47.519> then

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
and change the view to programmer then

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.900 
and change the view to programmer then
we<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.829> decimal<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.549> already

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
we can see that decimal is already

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.880 
we can see that decimal is already
selected<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.989> remember<00:02:52.200> decimal

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
selected right here and remember decimal

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.069 
selected right here and remember decimal
is<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.190> our<00:02:53.370> number<00:02:53.910> system<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.569> 1<00:02:54.810> 2<00:02:55.049> 3

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
is just our number system so like 1 2 3

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.680 
is just our number system so like 1 2 3
4<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:55.829> on<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.340> let<00:02:57.120> me<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.329> go<00:02:57.450> ahead<00:02:57.569> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
4 and so on so let me just go ahead and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.199 
4 and so on so let me just go ahead and
type<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.170> 71<00:02:58.920> right<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.730> those<00:02:59.910> type<00:03:00.060> in

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
type in 71 right here so those type in

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.270 
type in 71 right here so those type in
71<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.079> then<00:03:01.680> I'm<00:03:01.769> just<00:03:01.859> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.069> go<00:03:02.190> ahead

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
71 and then I'm just going to go ahead

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.490 
71 and then I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:03:02.670> change<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.209> binary<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.260> want<00:03:04.440> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
and change it to binary so we want to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.890 
and change it to binary so we want to
convert<00:03:04.829> this<00:03:05.069> number<00:03:05.489> 71<00:03:06.180> into<00:03:06.660> binary

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
convert this number 71 into binary

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.380 
convert this number 71 into binary
numbers<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.040> either<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> one<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.879> zero<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.359> I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
numbers so either a one or a zero so I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.020 
numbers so either a one or a zero so I
just<00:03:09.540> click<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.829> see<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.700> is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
just click that and we see that that is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.770 
just click that and we see that that is
what<00:03:12.620> 71<00:03:13.620> looks<00:03:13.920> like<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.220> binary<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.599> get<00:03:15.750> 1

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
what 71 looks like in binary so we get 1

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.860 
what 71 looks like in binary so we get 1
1<00:03:16.410> 1<00:03:17.400> 0<00:03:18.329> 0<00:03:18.389> 0<00:03:18.829> 1<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.849> doesn't<00:03:21.180> put<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.569> extra

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
1 1 0 0 0 1 and it doesn't put the extra

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.750 
1 1 0 0 0 1 and it doesn't put the extra
zero<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> end<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.859> here<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:23.609> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
zero on the end right here but it's just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.809 
zero on the end right here but it's just
like<00:03:23.910> our<00:03:24.090> numbers<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:25.079> had<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.819> 71

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
like our numbers so if we had like 71

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.699 
like our numbers so if we had like 71
well<00:03:27.590> 71<00:03:28.590> equals<00:03:28.950> 0<00:03:29.250> 7<00:03:29.760> 1<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.500> same

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
well 71 equals 0 7 1 so this is the same

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.129 
well 71 equals 0 7 1 so this is the same
thing<00:03:32.209> alright<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.419> let<00:03:33.690> me<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:33.900> run<00:03:34.079> through

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
thing alright so let me just run through

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.250 
thing alright so let me just run through
one<00:03:34.650> more<00:03:34.829> quick<00:03:35.040> example<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.510> let<00:03:36.780> me<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.989> go

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
one more quick example so let me just go

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.559 
one more quick example so let me just go
ahead<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.500> delete<00:03:37.980> all<00:03:38.040> that<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.940> paste<00:03:39.329> down

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
ahead and delete all that and paste down

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.259 
ahead and delete all that and paste down
the<00:03:39.750> one<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.109> previously<00:03:40.380> made<00:03:41.090> all<00:03:42.090> right

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
the one that I previously made all right

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.720 
the one that I previously made all right
so<00:03:42.510> as<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.049> can<00:03:43.169> see<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.799> one<00:03:44.099> is<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> lot

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
so as you can see this one is a lot

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.240 
so as you can see this one is a lot
bigger<00:03:45.060> than<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.599> previous<00:03:45.989> example<00:03:46.139> in<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
bigger than the previous example in the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.009 
bigger than the previous example in the
previous<00:03:47.280> example<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:48.209> were<00:03:48.480> only<00:03:48.660> working

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
previous example we were only working

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.039 
previous example we were only working
with<00:03:49.319> 8<00:03:49.560> bits<00:03:49.859> or<00:03:50.099> eight<00:03:50.340> binary<00:03:50.880> digits<00:03:51.299> now

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
with 8 bits or eight binary digits now

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.000 
with 8 bits or eight binary digits now
we're<00:03:52.500> working<00:03:52.650> with<00:03:52.980> 16<00:03:53.790> bits<00:03:54.180> or<00:03:54.500> 16<00:03:55.500> binary

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
we're working with 16 bits or 16 binary

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.580 
we're working with 16 bits or 16 binary
digits<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:57.510> reason<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:58.049> separated

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
digits and the reason that I separated

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.050 
digits and the reason that I separated
these<00:03:58.739> two<00:03:59.010> right<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> middle<00:03:59.579> here<00:03:59.669> is

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
these two right in the middle here is

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.440 
these two right in the middle here is
because<00:04:00.510> these<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:01.019> two<00:04:01.290> separate<00:04:01.769> bites

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
because these are two separate bites

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.119 
because these are two separate bites
however<00:04:03.450> these<00:04:03.810> two<00:04:04.079> bites<00:04:04.349> can<00:04:04.620> still<00:04:05.010> be

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
however these two bites can still be

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.580 
however these two bites can still be
read<00:04:05.340> together<00:04:05.549> as<00:04:06.000> one<00:04:06.329> number<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.410> let's

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
read together as one number so let's

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.500 
read together as one number so let's
just<00:04:07.739> go<00:04:07.829> ahead<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.099> calculate<00:04:08.579> out<00:04:09.060> what

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
just go ahead and calculate out what

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.569 
just go ahead and calculate out what
this<00:04:09.750> number<00:04:10.019> would<00:04:10.260> actually<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.769> in<00:04:11.069> decimal

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
this number would actually be in decimal

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.939 
this number would actually be in decimal
which<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.879> our<00:04:12.000> number<00:04:12.329> system<00:04:12.739> so<00:04:13.739> let<00:04:13.919> me

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
which is our number system so let me

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.500 
which is our number system so let me
just<00:04:14.099> change<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.489> brush<00:04:14.669> right<00:04:14.879> here<00:04:14.970> all

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
just change the brush right here all

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.229 
just change the brush right here all
right<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> 1<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:17.940> we're<00:04:18.060> going<00:04:18.150> to

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
right so this is a 1 so we're going to

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.110 
right so this is a 1 so we're going to
count<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.049> u<00:04:19.229> 1<00:04:19.530> plus

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
count the one so u 1 plus

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.580 
count the one so u 1 plus
going<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.329> count<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> two<00:04:21.840> since<00:04:22.229> this<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.560> a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
going to count the two since this is a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.120 
going to count the two since this is a
one<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:24.410> we're<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> count<00:04:26.010> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
one and we're not going to count the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.189 
one and we're not going to count the
four<00:04:26.400> since<00:04:26.760> this<00:04:26.880> is<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.060> zero<00:04:27.449> will<00:04:27.960> count

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
four since this is a zero will count

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.990 
four since this is a zero will count
both<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.560> eight<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.010> sixteen<00:04:29.460> though<00:04:29.669> since

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
both the eight and sixteen though since

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.330 
both the eight and sixteen though since
these<00:04:30.150> are<00:04:30.210> both<00:04:30.419> ones<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.500> plus<00:04:31.860> 8<00:04:32.100> +<00:04:32.460> +<00:04:33.449> 16<00:04:34.340> we

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
these are both ones so plus 8 + + 16 we

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.790 
these are both ones so plus 8 + + 16 we
won't<00:04:35.520> count<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.910> 32<00:04:36.389> or<00:04:36.630> 64<00:04:37.290> since<00:04:37.620> both<00:04:37.770> of

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
won't count the 32 or 64 since both of

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.920 
won't count the 32 or 64 since both of
these<00:04:38.040> are<00:04:38.220> zeros<00:04:38.610> but<00:04:39.090> we<00:04:39.210> will<00:04:39.479> count<00:04:39.720> this

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
these are zeros but we will count this

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.939 
these are zeros but we will count this
128<00:04:40.650> since<00:04:40.949> this<00:04:41.070> is<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> one<00:04:41.550> right<00:04:41.760> there<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.570> +

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
128 since this is a one right there so +

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.180 
128 since this is a one right there so +
128<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.690> now<00:04:45.690> we<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:46.110> simply<00:04:46.440> jump<00:04:46.740> over<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
128 and now we just simply jump over the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.450 
128 and now we just simply jump over the
next<00:04:47.580> bite<00:04:47.760> here<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.330> we'll<00:04:48.780> count<00:04:49.020> this<00:04:49.460> 256

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
next bite here and we'll count this 256

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.340 
next bite here and we'll count this 256
since<00:04:50.820> this<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.120> one<00:04:51.419> so<00:04:52.050> we<00:04:52.169> count<00:04:53.419> 256<00:04:54.419> we

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
since this is a one so we count 256 we

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.890 
since this is a one so we count 256 we
don't<00:04:55.590> count<00:04:55.860> 512<00:04:56.520> since<00:04:56.970> this<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.270> zero<00:04:57.600> but

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
don't count 512 since this is a zero but

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.070 
don't count 512 since this is a zero but
we<00:04:57.990> do<00:04:58.229> count<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:59.360> 1024<00:05:00.360> 1024<00:05:02.270> alright<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.510> now

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
we do count on 1024 1024 alright so now

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.969 
we do count on 1024 1024 alright so now
if<00:05:04.440> we<00:05:04.500> just<00:05:04.770> add<00:05:05.060> all<00:05:06.060> these<00:05:06.419> up<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:07.680> will<00:05:07.770> get

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
if we just add all these up we will get

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.650 
if we just add all these up we will get
the<00:05:08.130> number<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.699> this<00:05:08.850> binary<00:05:09.120> number

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
the number that this binary number

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.480 
the number that this binary number
represents<00:05:10.320> so<00:05:10.620> let<00:05:10.830> me<00:05:10.889> just<00:05:10.979> go<00:05:11.100> back<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
represents so let me just go back to the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.909 
represents so let me just go back to the
calculator<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.360> add<00:05:12.780> all<00:05:13.080> those<00:05:13.410> numbers<00:05:13.620> up

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
calculator and add all those numbers up

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:21.520 
calculator and add all those numbers up
right<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.940> we<00:05:15.060> do<00:05:15.180> 1<00:05:15.479> +<00:05:15.990> 2<00:05:16.289> +<00:05:16.800> 8<00:05:18.380> 16<00:05:19.820> 128

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
right there so we do 1 + 2 + 8 16 128

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.820 
right there so we do 1 + 2 + 8 16 128
256<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:24.110> 1024<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.349> we<00:05:25.979> get<00:05:27.080> 1435<00:05:28.080> let<00:05:28.650> me<00:05:28.740> just

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
256 and 1024 and we get 1435 let me just

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.469 
256 and 1024 and we get 1435 let me just
go<00:05:28.950> ahead<00:05:29.070> and<00:05:29.220> write<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.760> down<00:05:29.970> right<00:05:30.030> here

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
go ahead and write this down right here

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.659 
go ahead and write this down right here
and<00:05:30.660> then<00:05:31.500> we<00:05:31.590> can<00:05:31.710> go<00:05:31.740> ahead<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.130> check

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
and then we can go ahead and check

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.330 
and then we can go ahead and check
ourselves<00:05:33.289> so<00:05:34.289> remember<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.770> check<00:05:35.130> ourselves

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
ourselves so remember to check ourselves

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.029 
ourselves so remember to check ourselves
all<00:05:35.910> we<00:05:36.150> have<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.360> do<00:05:36.599> is<00:05:36.840> just<00:05:37.349> click<00:05:37.590> on<00:05:37.800> this

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
all we have to do is just click on this

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.520 
all we have to do is just click on this
binary<00:05:38.460> right<00:05:38.940> here<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.720> bin<00:05:40.020> stands<00:05:40.349> for

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
binary right here this bin stands for

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.680 
binary right here this bin stands for
binary<00:05:40.710> just<00:05:41.430> click<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.150> now<00:05:42.479> we<00:05:42.539> see

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
binary just click on that and now we see

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.219 
binary just click on that and now we see
um<00:05:43.169> we<00:05:43.800> get<00:05:43.979> what<00:05:47.120> 1435<00:05:48.120> looks<00:05:48.450> like<00:05:48.630> in<00:05:48.780> binary

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
um we get what 1435 looks like in binary

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.210 
um we get what 1435 looks like in binary
so<00:05:49.410> let's<00:05:49.560> just<00:05:49.680> go<00:05:49.770> ahead<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:49.979> check

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
so let's just go ahead and check

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:58.930 
so let's just go ahead and check
ourselves<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.389> 1<00:05:51.660> 1<00:05:51.690> 0<00:05:52.680> 1<00:05:53.010> 1<00:05:53.220> 0<00:05:53.789> 0<00:05:54.800> 1<00:05:55.910> 1<00:05:56.910> 0<00:05:57.210> 1

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
ourselves so it's 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.180 
ourselves so it's 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1
there<00:05:59.940> you<00:06:00.030> go<00:06:00.470> alright<00:06:01.470> so<00:06:01.740> that's<00:06:01.949> pretty

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
there you go alright so that's pretty

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.920 
there you go alright so that's pretty
much<00:06:02.280> all<00:06:02.580> there<00:06:02.760> is<00:06:02.820> to<00:06:03.180> converting<00:06:03.660> binary

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
much all there is to converting binary

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.140 
much all there is to converting binary
numbers<00:06:04.530> into<00:06:04.860> decimal<00:06:05.280> numbers<00:06:05.610> or<00:06:05.849> into<00:06:06.120> the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
numbers into decimal numbers or into the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.990 
numbers into decimal numbers or into the
numbers<00:06:06.510> that<00:06:06.660> you<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:06.930> I<00:06:07.020> know<00:06:07.099> so<00:06:08.099> that's<00:06:08.820> it

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
numbers that you and I know so that's it

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.860 
numbers that you and I know so that's it
for<00:06:09.030> this<00:06:09.270> tutorial<00:06:09.419> so<00:06:10.229> see<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:10.800> guys
