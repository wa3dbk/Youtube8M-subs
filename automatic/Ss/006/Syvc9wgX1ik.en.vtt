organic<00:01:29.670> program<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.259> recommend<00:01:31.979> it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
organic program that I recommend it's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.480 
organic program that I recommend it's
very<00:01:32.490> simple<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:34.200> easy<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:35.070> you'll<00:01:35.280> hear

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
very simple it's easy to use you'll hear

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
very simple it's easy to use you'll hear
some<00:01:35.670> terms<00:01:36.000> it'll<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.509> new<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.110> soon<00:01:37.290> as

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
some terms it'll be new but as soon as

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
some terms it'll be new but as soon as
you<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.680> some<00:01:38.520> comfort<00:01:38.790> level<00:01:39.299> you'll<00:01:39.420> find

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you get some comfort level you'll find

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
you get some comfort level you'll find
that<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> program<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.530> easier<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that the program is really easier and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
that the program is really easier and
works<00:01:41.909> better<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.450> every<00:01:43.110> way

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
works better in every way

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.249 
works better in every way
including<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> financial<00:01:45.509> standpoint<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
including from a financial standpoint we

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.219 
including from a financial standpoint we

I've pushed it aside and tried to find
an<00:02:11.520> even<00:02:11.730> better

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
an even better

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.380 
an even better
go<00:02:12.960> and<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.980> bottom<00:02:14.340> line<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.240> you

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
go and the bottom line is that if you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.180 
go and the bottom line is that if you
use<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.750> natural<00:02:15.900> organic<00:02:16.260> program<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.160> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
use the natural organic program that I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.820 
use the natural organic program that I
recommend<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.420> will<00:02:18.630> work<00:02:18.870> better<00:02:19.200> than<00:02:19.530> any

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
recommend it will work better than any

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.790 
recommend it will work better than any
other<00:02:20.100> program<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.640> you've<00:02:21.180> ever<00:02:21.390> tried<00:02:21.800> we

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
other program that you've ever tried we

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.220 
other program that you've ever tried we
we're<00:02:23.670> very<00:02:24.000> confident<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.870> not<00:02:25.050> only

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
we're very confident that it not only

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.890 
we're very confident that it not only
will<00:02:25.890> produce<00:02:26.220> food<00:02:26.850> crops<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.420> ornamental

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
will produce food crops and ornamental

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.590 
will produce food crops and ornamental
plants<00:02:28.410> for<00:02:28.590> landscaping<00:02:29.160> very<00:02:29.880> very<00:02:30.270> well

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
plants for landscaping very very well

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.890 
plants for landscaping very very well
and<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.470> an<00:02:31.590> easy<00:02:31.920> system<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> use<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.750> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and it's an easy system to use but it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.130 
and it's an easy system to use but it
also<00:02:34.110> works<00:02:35.070> better<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:36.000> every<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.990> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
also works better in every way and that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
also works better in every way and that
includes<00:02:37.500> from<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.740> financial<00:02:38.340> standpoint<00:02:38.640> one

includes from a financial standpoint one

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.910 
includes from a financial standpoint one
of<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.630> biggest<00:02:39.870> misconceptions<00:02:40.050> about

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
of the biggest misconceptions about

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.540 
of the biggest misconceptions about
organics<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> cost<00:02:42.480> too<00:02:43.410> much<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:44.490> I

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
organics is that it cost too much and I

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.390 
organics is that it cost too much and I
think<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.940> comes<00:02:45.240> from<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.800> grocery<00:02:46.800> stores

think that comes from the grocery stores

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.310

my<00:04:32.729> basic<00:04:32.970> program<00:04:33.509> is<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.289> stop<00:04:34.590> doing<00:04:35.009> those

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159

toxic pesticides and then start adding
