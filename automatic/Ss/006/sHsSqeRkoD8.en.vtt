really looked and there was one and

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.140 
really looked and there was one and
there<00:01:57.010> was<00:01:57.100> two<00:01:57.310> three

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
there was two three

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.820 
there was two three
there<00:01:58.480> was<00:01:58.570> three<00:01:59.050> on<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.290> wall<00:01:59.470> there<00:01:59.710> was

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
meters

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.710 
meters
kind<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.930> spooky<00:02:05.320> fish<00:02:05.590> especially<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.550> that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
kind of spooky fish especially in that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.810 
kind of spooky fish especially in that
dark<00:02:07.720> overhangs<00:02:08.590> our<00:02:09.070> tails<00:02:09.340> are<00:02:09.610> just

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
dark overhangs our tails are just

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.240 
dark overhangs our tails are just
sticking<00:02:10.060> out<00:02:10.300> at<00:02:11.110> least<00:02:11.380> five<00:02:11.680> or<00:02:11.740> six<00:02:12.070> feet

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
sticking out at least five or six feet

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.980 
sticking out at least five or six feet
long<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.790> there<00:02:12.970> they<00:02:13.240> bumped<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> camera<00:02:13.960> a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
long in there they bumped the camera a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.780 
long in there they bumped the camera a
couple<00:02:14.140> times<00:02:14.530> underwater<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.460> could<00:02:15.640> feel

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
couple times underwater and I could feel

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.690 
couple times underwater and I could feel
their<00:02:16.000> strength

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.640 

now<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:24.120> hard<00:02:24.510> proof<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:24.960> there<00:02:25.410> are

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
now we have hard proof that there are

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.150 
now we have hard proof that there are
large<00:02:26.340> goonch<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.970> these<00:02:27.120> waters<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:28.160> they

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
large goonch in these waters that they

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.070 
large goonch in these waters that they
stick<00:02:29.430> together<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.330> found<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> deep

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
stick together and are found in the deep

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.910 
stick together and are found in the deep
pools<00:02:31.410> tight<00:02:32.160> against<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.610> rocks
