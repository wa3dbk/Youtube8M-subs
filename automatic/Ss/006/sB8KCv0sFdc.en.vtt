and<00:01:13.060> i'll<00:01:14.060> show<00:01:14.090> you<00:01:14.360> how<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.570> craft<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.140> motor

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
and i'll show you how to craft the motor

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:27.870 
and i'll show you how to craft the motor
boat<00:01:16.600> because<00:01:17.600> there<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:22.220> speedboat<00:01:26.650> and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
boat because there and the speedboat and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.940 
boat because there and the speedboat and
the<00:01:28.880> stunt<00:01:29.210> boat<00:01:29.570> which<00:01:29.900> is<00:01:30.110> there<00:01:34.000> so<00:01:35.000> i<00:01:35.030> will

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
the stunt boat which is there so i will

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.710 
the stunt boat which is there so i will
get<00:01:36.950> those<00:01:37.130> out<00:01:37.370> i'll<00:01:37.880> probably<00:01:38.270> won't<00:01:38.600> get

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
get those out i'll probably won't get

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.360 
get those out i'll probably won't get
that<00:01:38.930> ice<00:01:39.320> breaker<00:01:39.680> out<00:01:39.800> because<00:01:39.980> all<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.250> is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
that ice breaker out because all that is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.150 
that ice breaker out because all that is
is<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.670> ammonia<00:01:41.000> boat<00:01:41.300> its<00:01:41.540> message<00:01:41.900> twice

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
is this ammonia boat its message twice

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.370 
is this ammonia boat its message twice
so<00:01:43.160> i'll<00:01:43.610> show<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:45.260> motor<00:01:45.530> boat<00:01:45.890> fast<00:01:46.190> so

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
so i'll show you the motor boat fast so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.380 
so i'll show you the motor boat fast so
just<00:01:48.380> looks<00:01:48.590> like<00:01:49.250> an<00:01:49.370> old<00:01:49.520> normal<00:01:50.030> boats<00:01:50.210> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
just looks like an old normal boats that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.700 
just looks like an old normal boats that
when<00:01:50.570> I've<00:01:50.660> got<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.810> little<00:01:50.930> metal<00:01:51.200> thing<00:01:52.159> there

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
when I've got a little metal thing there

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.530 
when I've got a little metal thing there
so<00:01:54.710> all<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.520> only<00:01:55.730> different<00:01:56.030> thing<00:01:56.090> with

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
so all the only different thing with

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.350 
so all the only different thing with
this<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.440> it's<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.710> tad<00:01:57.950> faster<00:01:58.360> that's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
this is just it's a tad faster that's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.460 
this is just it's a tad faster that's
quite<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.720> lot<00:01:59.870> faster<00:02:01.810> than<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.110> normal

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
quite a lot faster than the normal

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.949 
quite a lot faster than the normal
default<00:02:03.650> one<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:07.010> a<00:02:07.070> lot<00:02:07.340> faster<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:08.179> have

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
default one so it's a lot faster I have

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.100 
default one so it's a lot faster I have
seen<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:11.450> cool

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.540 

okay<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.560> one's<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.310> trying

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
okay so that one's that one I'm trying

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.850 
okay so that one's that one I'm trying
to<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.790> back<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.120> harbor<00:02:18.450> yeah<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.620> quite

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
to get back to my harbor yeah it's quite

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.800 
to get back to my harbor yeah it's quite
hard<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.580> handle<00:02:21.000> compared<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.690> other

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
hard to handle compared to the other

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380 
hard to handle compared to the other
ones<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.200> they're<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.500> fast<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.390> just

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
ones because they're so fast I just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.940 
ones because they're so fast I just
crash<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:26.629> found<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.470> find<00:02:28.739> these

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
crash it I found I think I find these

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.589 
crash it I found I think I find these
ones<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.370> easier<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.730> crash<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.360> don't

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
ones are easier to crash I don't

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.150 
ones are easier to crash I don't
actually<00:02:30.930> know<00:02:31.230> why<00:02:31.410> but<00:02:31.680> they're<00:02:31.799> easier<00:02:32.129> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
actually know why but they're easier to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.140 
actually know why but they're easier to
crash<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> even<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.970> speedboat<00:02:35.970> it's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
crash so even in the speedboat it's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.380 
crash so even in the speedboat it's
basically<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> motor<00:02:36.840> boat<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.440> faster<00:02:38.390> so

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
basically the motor boat but faster so

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.570 
basically the motor boat but faster so
it<00:02:39.540> adds<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.989> nice<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.830> diamond<00:02:41.129> into<00:02:41.970> it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
it adds a nice like a diamond into it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.140 
it adds a nice like a diamond into it
silver<00:02:44.630> well<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:46.440> add<00:02:46.500> a<00:02:46.590> few<00:02:46.739> 60-ton<00:02:47.310> okay

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
silver well just add a few 60-ton okay

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.400 
silver well just add a few 60-ton okay
let's<00:02:48.269> go<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.450> way<00:02:49.370> flip<00:02:50.370> flip<00:02:51.290> what's<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
let's go this way flip flip what's that

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.130 
let's go this way flip flip what's that
it's<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.220> hard<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> control<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.150> once

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's really hard to control this is once

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.330

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
them down so this is an all green one

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.750 
them down so this is an all green one
but<00:05:49.090> sometimes<00:05:49.300> when<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:49.810> put<00:05:49.960> things<00:05:50.199> down

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
but sometimes when you put things down

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.300 
but sometimes when you put things down
it<00:05:51.760> ends<00:05:52.120> up<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.330> bit<00:05:52.510> random<00:05:52.919> I'll<00:05:53.919> try<00:05:54.070> and<00:05:54.220> get

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
it ends up a bit random I'll try and get

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.089 
it ends up a bit random I'll try and get
a<00:05:54.340> random<00:05:54.760> one<00:05:54.880> I<00:05:55.470> was<00:05:56.470> no<00:05:56.590> random<00:05:56.800> ones<00:05:57.070> there

wonder<00:07:23.020> it<00:07:24.030> but<00:07:25.030> yeah<00:07:25.180> there<00:07:25.480> is<00:07:25.630> ram<00:07:26.320> random

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:26.950 
wonder it but yeah there is ram random

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.550 
wonder it but yeah there is ram random
one<00:07:27.160> so<00:07:27.460> if<00:07:27.760> you<00:07:27.940> think<00:07:28.000> why<00:07:28.420> i<00:07:28.450> got<00:07:28.750> random<00:07:29.350> one

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
one so if you think why i got random one

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.020 
one so if you think why i got random one
it's<00:07:30.490> because<00:07:30.670> there's<00:07:31.000> random<00:07:31.420> ones<00:07:32.760> yeah<00:07:33.760> so

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.030 
it's because there's random ones yeah so

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.790 
it's because there's random ones yeah so
this<00:07:34.270> is<00:07:34.480> just<00:07:34.630> i<00:07:34.930> think<00:07:35.080> it<00:07:35.440> just<00:07:35.560> looks

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 
this is just i think it just looks

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.270 
this is just i think it just looks
default<00:07:36.280> by<00:07:36.430> spreaker<00:07:37.710> yeah<00:07:38.710> and<00:07:38.950> it<00:07:39.100> just

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
default by spreaker yeah and it just

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.520 
default by spreaker yeah and it just
breaks<00:07:39.490> the<00:07:39.700> ice<00:07:41.610> so<00:07:42.610> that's<00:07:43.510> it<00:07:43.720> so<00:07:44.020> i<00:07:44.320> hope

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
breaks the ice so that's it so i hope

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.700 
breaks the ice so that's it so i hope
