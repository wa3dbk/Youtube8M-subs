00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.889 
side towards the side where I've now
picked<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> section<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> I'm<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
picked up the section and I'm going to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.069 
picked up the section and I'm going to
wrap<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:45.110> around<00:01:47.869> just<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wrap it kind of around just like that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.160 
wrap it kind of around just like that
I'm<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> carry<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.640> twist<00:01:51.030> over<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
I'm going to carry that twist over to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.209 
I'm going to carry that twist over to
this<00:01:52.320> side<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:54.200> pick<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> piece<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.920> I'm

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
this side and pick up a piece here I'm

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.580 
this side and pick up a piece here I'm
going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.610> wrap<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> hair<00:01:57.270> around<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:58.200> twist

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to wrap the hair around that twist

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
going to wrap the hair around that twist
to<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.939> twisting<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> same

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
to kind of twisting it all in the same

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
to kind of twisting it all in the same
direction<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.890> gonna<00:02:02.040> carry<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
direction I'm gonna carry it back to the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
direction I'm gonna carry it back to the
other<00:02:03.030> side<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.600> head<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.619> gonna

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
other side of my head and it's gonna

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
other side of my head and it's gonna
flop<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.430> whatever<00:02:05.729> direction<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.299> wants<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
flop in whatever direction it wants to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.559 
flop in whatever direction it wants to
you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> either<00:02:08.099> hold<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:09.030> pin<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.450> as

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you can either hold it down or pin it as

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.639 
you can either hold it down or pin it as
you<00:02:10.140> go<00:02:10.319> along

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you go along

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
you go along
I<00:02:10.979> tend<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> put<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> pins<00:02:12.180> in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
I tend to put the pins in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:25.710 
I tend to put the pins in
at<00:02:12.659> the<00:02:12.870> end<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:14.040> however<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:14.970> want<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.420 

you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.500> essentially<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you can see that this is essentially the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.070 
you can see that this is essentially the
same<00:02:28.640> pattern<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.390> way<00:02:29.540> down<00:02:29.810> you're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
same pattern all the way down you're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.540 
same pattern all the way down you're
just<00:02:30.260> kind<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.530> picking<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.980> pair<00:02:31.220> from<00:02:31.370> either

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
just kind of picking a pair from either

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.880 
just kind of picking a pair from either
side<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> head<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.510> adding<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.500> into<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
side of the head and adding it into the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.479 
side of the head and adding it into the
twist<00:02:38.200> when<00:02:39.200> all<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.590> hair<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:39.830> added<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.280> use

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
twist when all the hair is added in use

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.430 
twist when all the hair is added in use
the<00:02:40.670> last<00:02:40.880> twist<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.300> form<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.630> small<00:02:41.870> bun<00:02:42.140> and

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the last twist to form a small bun and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
the last twist to form a small bun and
tuck<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.040> ends<00:02:43.310> underneath<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:43.880> neatly<00:02:44.090> as

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
tuck the ends underneath as neatly as

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.420 
tuck the ends underneath as neatly as
you<00:02:44.390> can<00:02:44.600> once<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.560> finished<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.069> like<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
you can once I'm finished I like to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.040 
you can once I'm finished I like to
reinforce<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:47.090> whole<00:02:47.239> thing<00:02:47.540> with<00:02:47.750> another

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
reinforce the whole thing with another

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.540 
reinforce the whole thing with another
two<00:02:48.290> or<00:02:48.319> three<00:02:48.470> pins<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.160> then<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.400> usually

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
two or three pins and then I'm usually

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.050 
two or three pins and then I'm usually
good<00:02:49.819> to<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:52.630> we<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.760> case<00:02:55.910> you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
good to go we can and just in case you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.580 
good to go we can and just in case you
were<00:02:56.209> curious<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:56.810> what<00:02:57.080> my<00:02:57.200> hair<00:02:57.380> looked

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
were curious this is what my hair looked

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.259 
were curious this is what my hair looked
like<00:02:57.739> about<00:02:57.890> two<00:02:58.250> hours<00:02:58.430> after<00:02:58.700> taking<00:02:59.180> it

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
like about two hours after taking it

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.059 
like about two hours after taking it
down<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.720> think<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.530> see<00:03:00.680> what<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.860> mean

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
down I think you can see what I mean

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.009 
down I think you can see what I mean
when<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.250> say<00:03:01.519> sometimes<00:03:01.970> uses<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:02.420> method<00:03:02.690> to

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
when I say sometimes uses this method to

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.199 
when I say sometimes uses this method to
prep<00:03:03.200> my<00:03:03.350> hair<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.709> something<00:03:04.010> else<00:03:04.190> anyway<00:03:05.180> I

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
prep my hair for something else anyway I

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.640 
prep my hair for something else anyway I
hope<00:03:05.569> you<00:03:05.750> liked<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.019> quick<00:03:06.230> little<00:03:06.350> braid

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
hope you liked this quick little braid

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.390
