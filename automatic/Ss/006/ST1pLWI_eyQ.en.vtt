about<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.820> sun<00:00:15.060> zones<00:00:15.390> in<00:00:15.690> your<00:00:15.810> yard<00:00:16.080> right

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.779 
about the sun zones in your yard right
now<00:00:16.560> I'm<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.890> an<00:00:16.950> area<00:00:17.130> which<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.340> consider

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
now I'm in an area which we consider

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.210 
now I'm in an area which we consider
full<00:00:18.060> Sun<00:00:18.360> which<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.690> six<00:00:19.320> hours<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> more<00:00:20.010> Sun

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
full Sun which is six hours of more Sun

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.100 
full Sun which is six hours of more Sun
a<00:00:20.369> day<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.880> that's<00:00:21.210> why<00:00:21.450> we<00:00:21.630> picked<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> plant

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
a day and that's why we picked the plant

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.930 
a day and that's why we picked the plant
material<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.710> here

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.490 

now<00:00:26.940> here's<00:00:27.150> another<00:00:27.210> zone<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> yard<00:00:28.110> this

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
now here's another zone in the yard this

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050 
now here's another zone in the yard this
is<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.770> we<00:00:28.890> would<00:00:29.010> consider<00:00:29.070> partial<00:00:29.820> Sun

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
is what we would consider partial Sun

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.300 
is what we would consider partial Sun
which<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.539> three<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.140> six<00:00:31.380> hours<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.740> Sun<00:00:32.039> a<00:00:32.220> day

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
which is three to six hours of Sun a day

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.130 
which is three to six hours of Sun a day
and<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:32.970> the<00:00:33.120> reason<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.570> we've<00:00:33.960> picked

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and that's the reason that we've picked

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.040 
and that's the reason that we've picked
these<00:00:34.350> plant<00:00:34.649> materials<00:00:38.750> now<00:00:39.750> we're<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:39.989> a
