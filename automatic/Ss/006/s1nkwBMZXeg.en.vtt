yourself<00:02:07.039> login<00:02:08.300> just<00:02:09.300> wait<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
yourself login just wait for it and so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.309 
yourself login just wait for it and so
the<00:02:10.890> next<00:02:11.069> step<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:12.120> exactly<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.080> same

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the next step is just exactly the same

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.820 
the next step is just exactly the same
as<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
as that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.790 
as that
except<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.550> with<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> shaders<00:02:15.240> mod

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
except you do it with the shaders mod

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
except you do it with the shaders mod
okay<00:02:16.800> there<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.810> tell<00:02:19.020> it's

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
okay there we go so you can tell it's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.250 
okay there we go so you can tell it's
working<00:02:19.560> where<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.810> go

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
working where you go on here just go

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.090 
working where you go on here just go
fullscreen<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:24.620> figure<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
fullscreen and figure out if in and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.070 
fullscreen and figure out if in and
three<00:02:26.990> you<00:02:27.990> can<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.380> there<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> see<00:02:30.450> it

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
three you can see there can you see it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.380 
three you can see there can you see it
says<00:02:31.350> Optifine<00:02:31.920> one<00:02:32.550> point<00:02:32.730> five<00:02:32.940> point<00:02:33.000> two

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
says Optifine one point five point two

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.350 
says Optifine one point five point two
HD<00:02:33.990> yeah<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:34.950> basically<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.520> also<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.060> makes

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
HD yeah so basically it also just makes

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540 
HD yeah so basically it also just makes
your<00:02:36.510> minecraft<00:02:36.930> run<00:02:37.320> faster<00:02:37.830> has<00:02:38.040> faster

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
your minecraft run faster has faster

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.780 
your minecraft run faster has faster
frame<00:02:38.760> rate<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.690> need<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> for<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.380> mod

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
frame rate so you need it for this mod

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.160 
frame rate so you need it for this mod
okay<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.390> save<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.470> quit<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:46.020> get

you're going to go back to that to that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.780 
you're going to go back to that to that
minecraft.jar<00:02:57.600> folder<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.350> made<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.459> you

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
doesn't actually change anything you

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.500 
doesn't actually change anything you
need<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> go<00:03:43.680> into<00:03:43.830> shaders<00:03:44.340> I<00:03:44.430> forgot<00:03:45.360> about

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
need to go into shaders I forgot about

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.930 
need to go into shaders I forgot about
the<00:03:45.989> shader<00:03:46.200> pack<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.040> when<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.489> go

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
the shader pack so when you actually go

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.060 
the shader pack so when you actually go
on<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.840> doesn't<00:03:49.260> actually<00:03:49.380> work<00:03:49.709> straight

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
on it doesn't actually work straight

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.160 
on it doesn't actually work straight
away<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.700> need<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> download<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.810> shaders

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
away you need a download the shaders

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.560 
away you need a download the shaders
pack<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.950> all<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.340> does<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.670> making<00:03:54.000> compatible

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
pack so all it does is making compatible

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.380 
pack so all it does is making compatible
we<00:03:54.690> showed<00:03:54.870> us<00:03:54.959> back<00:03:55.340> if<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.000> click<00:03:57.180> this

we showed us back if so just click this

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.440 
we showed us back if so just click this
then<00:03:58.019> hopefully<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.470> folder<00:03:58.890> she'll<00:03:59.190> come<00:03:59.340> up

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
then hopefully the folder she'll come up

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.530 
then hopefully the folder she'll come up
then<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.600> just<00:04:00.750> got<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.930> shaders<00:04:01.380> back<00:04:01.590> and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
then you just got to shaders back and

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.560 
then you just got to shaders back and
I'm<00:04:03.540> pretty<00:04:03.780> sure<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.350> what<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.560> do<00:04:05.570> just
