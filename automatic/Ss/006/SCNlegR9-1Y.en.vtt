thunder<00:00:15.059> 380<00:00:15.540> which<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> single<00:00:16.770> action

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
thunder 380 which is a single action

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
thunder 380 which is a single action
double<00:00:17.310> action<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.789> has<00:00:17.970> very<00:00:18.270> similar

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
double action and has very similar

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.910 
double action and has very similar
features<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.439> what<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.160> 1911<00:00:20.520> would<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.920> with

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
features to what in 1911 would have with

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.330 
features to what in 1911 would have with
a<00:00:22.949> 1911<00:00:23.430> there's<00:00:23.939> three<00:00:24.300> types<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:25.070> ways<00:00:26.070> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
a 1911 there's three types of ways to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.330 
a 1911 there's three types of ways to
carry<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.000> guess<00:00:27.470> there's<00:00:28.470> condition<00:00:29.039> one

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
carry it I guess there's condition one

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
carry it I guess there's condition one
two<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.000> three<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.840> I'll<00:00:30.960> go<00:00:31.170> over<00:00:31.289> each<00:00:31.590> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
two and three and I'll go over each of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.990 
two and three and I'll go over each of
those<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> advantages<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
those and the advantages and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.840 
those and the advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.960> each<00:00:34.910> one<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> 1911

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
disadvantages of each one a 1911

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
disadvantages of each one a 1911
basically<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.059> single<00:00:39.390> action<00:00:39.690> trigger

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
basically it's a single action trigger

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.660 
basically it's a single action trigger
meaning<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> light<00:00:40.800> trigger<00:00:41.100> pull<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
meaning it's a light trigger pull the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.389 
meaning it's a light trigger pull the
trigger<00:00:42.440> performs<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.680> action<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.370> to

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
trigger performs one action which is to

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.869 
trigger performs one action which is to
release<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.910> hammer<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:46.559> fire<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.129> weapon

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
release the hammer and fire your weapon

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
release the hammer and fire your weapon
on<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:49.289> 1911's<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> manual

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
essentially in 1911 clone so I'll use it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.560 
essentially in 1911 clone so I'll use it
to<00:01:02.070> demonstrate<00:01:02.280> since<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.270> everyday

safety<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> most<00:01:15.540> ready

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
safety on that is the most ready

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.760 
safety on that is the most ready
position<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.770> some

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
position that it can be in and some

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.370 
position that it can be in and some
people<00:01:19.799> are<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.450> intimidated

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
people are a little you know intimidated

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.310 
people are a little you know intimidated
by<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:23.810> you're<00:01:24.810> essentially

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
by this because you're essentially

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
by this because you're essentially
relying<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> safety<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.060> such<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
relying on a safety because it's such a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
relying on a safety because it's such a
light<00:01:27.600> trigger<00:01:27.900> pull<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:29.070> keep<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> gun<00:01:29.549> from

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
light trigger pull to keep the gun from

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.800 
light trigger pull to keep the gun from
from<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.450> firing<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.549> on<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> full<00:01:32.939> sized<00:01:33.210> 1911

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
from not firing but on a full sized 1911

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
from not firing but on a full sized 1911
we're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> added<00:01:35.670> safety<00:01:36.119> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
we're going to have the added safety of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.030 
we're going to have the added safety of
a<00:01:36.750> beaver<00:01:37.590> tail<00:01:37.890> safety<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.400> well<00:01:39.439> why<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.500> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
a beaver tail safety as well why this is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.899 
a beaver tail safety as well why this is
so<00:01:41.430> advantageous<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:43.250> basically<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.640> only

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so advantageous is basically your only

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.710 
so advantageous is basically your only
action<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> fire<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.229> gun<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.680> once<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.130> draw

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
action to fire this gun is once you draw

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.639 
action to fire this gun is once you draw
that<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:50.509> take<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> safety<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> fire

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that is to take the safety off and fire

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
that is to take the safety off and fire
the<00:01:53.250> gun<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.759> pretty<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the gun that's pretty much all there is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
the gun that's pretty much all there is
to<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.649> quick<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.790> easy

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to it so it's it's quick and it's easy

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.039 
to it so it's it's quick and it's easy
and<00:01:57.450> less<00:01:58.020> steps<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.250> deal<00:01:59.460> with<00:02:00.049> condition

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and less steps to to deal with condition

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.810 
and less steps to to deal with condition
to<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> 1911<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.299> single<00:02:03.630> action<00:02:03.960> style<00:02:04.200> gun

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
to on a 1911 or single action style gun

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.719 
to on a 1911 or single action style gun
would<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.030> around<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> chamber

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
would be around in the chamber

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.809 
would be around in the chamber
hammer<00:02:08.729> down<00:02:09.780> safety<00:02:10.500> on

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
hammer down safety on

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.929 
hammer down safety on
so<00:02:12.719> you<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:13.019> two<00:02:13.319> steps<00:02:13.709> now<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.310> order<00:02:14.849> to

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
so you have two steps now in order to

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.140 
so you have two steps now in order to
fire<00:02:15.299> this<00:02:15.510> gun<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.109> one<00:02:16.590> would<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:17.150> safety

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fire this gun that one would be safety

a little more complicated the other

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.860 
a little more complicated the other
thing<00:02:24.359> is<00:02:25.879> you're<00:02:26.879> gonna<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.420> get<00:02:27.629> used

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
then gently letting the hammer down so

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.920 
then gently letting the hammer down so
you<00:02:34.890> don't<00:02:34.920> fire<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.430> round<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:35.939> that<00:02:36.629> takes

a<00:02:37.079> lot<00:02:37.379> of<00:02:37.409> practice<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.389> even<00:02:39.389> then

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
a lot of practice and even then

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.289 
a lot of practice and even then
accidents<00:02:41.219> happen<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.760> you've<00:02:41.879> got<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.180> be

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
accidents happen so you've got to be

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.830 
accidents happen so you've got to be
extremely<00:02:43.290> careful<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.609> do<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.000> and

area trying to let the hammer down the
next<00:02:52.379> link<00:02:52.560> accidentally<00:02:53.400> goes<00:02:53.579> off<00:02:53.790> you're

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
next link accidentally goes off you're

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.170 
next link accidentally goes off you're
gonna<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.419> some<00:02:54.659> explaining<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> do<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.799> that

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
so that's another thing condition 3

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.679 
so that's another thing condition 3

would be hammered down safety on and no
round<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.379> chamber<00:03:04.409> so<00:03:05.040> you've<00:03:06.000> got<00:03:06.269> to

action gun condition - can be
advantageous

advantageous

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.770

basically<00:04:29.890> there's<00:04:30.130> condition<00:04:30.700> one<00:04:30.910> round<00:04:31.600> in

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
basically there's condition one round in

condition two on a single action double
action<00:04:37.960> gun<00:04:38.200> can<00:04:38.920> be<00:04:38.950> kind<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.370> nice<00:04:39.520> because

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
action gun can be kind of nice because

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.580 
action gun can be kind of nice because
you've<00:04:40.090> got<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> round<00:04:40.570> chambered<00:04:40.660> safety<00:04:41.470> on

you've got a round chambered safety on

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.590 
you've got a round chambered safety on
but<00:04:42.220> because<00:04:42.370> it's<00:04:42.670> double<00:04:42.940> action<00:04:43.360> on<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
but because it's double action on the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.400 
but because it's double action on the
first<00:04:43.870> shot

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
first shot

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.130 
first shot
you've<00:04:45.010> got<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.220> longer<00:04:45.520> trigger<00:04:45.970> pull<00:04:46.270> but<00:04:47.050> you

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
you've got a longer trigger pull but you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.280 
you've got a longer trigger pull but you
don't<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.980> pull<00:04:48.220> back<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.670> hammer

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
don't have to pull back that hammer

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.210 
don't have to pull back that hammer
basically<00:04:50.290> you're<00:04:50.470> just<00:04:50.500> gonna<00:04:50.860> pull<00:04:51.100> the

striker-fired double action pistols
you're<00:05:32.980> essentially<00:05:33.820> walking<00:05:34.120> around<00:05:34.570> with<00:05:34.840> a

safety on a majority of those guns aside

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.450

from<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.970> trigger<00:05:43.240> safety<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:44.500> basically<00:05:45.070> all

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
from the trigger safety so basically all

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.040 
from the trigger safety so basically all
you<00:05:45.910> have<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.060> do<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.240> pull<00:05:46.450> the<00:05:46.540> trigger<00:05:46.810> in

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
you have to do is pull the trigger in

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.680 
you have to do is pull the trigger in
and<00:05:47.290> they're<00:05:47.500> gonna<00:05:47.620> fire<00:05:47.950> so<00:05:48.400> if<00:05:48.730> you<00:05:49.270> ask<00:05:49.390> me

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
and they're gonna fire so if you ask me

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.070 
and they're gonna fire so if you ask me
this<00:05:49.990> is<00:05:50.200> actually<00:05:50.380> a<00:05:50.710> safer<00:05:51.550> gun<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:52.720> carry

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
this is actually a safer gun to carry

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.590 
this is actually a safer gun to carry
cocked<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.190> locked<00:05:54.370> because<00:05:54.790> you've<00:05:55.270> still

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
cocked and locked because you've still

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.530 
cocked and locked because you've still
got<00:05:55.810> your<00:05:55.990> manual<00:05:56.410> safety<00:05:56.890> here<00:05:57.220> as<00:05:57.540> opposed

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
got your manual safety here as opposed

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.260 
got your manual safety here as opposed
to<00:05:58.720> something<00:05:59.080> like<00:05:59.320> a<00:05:59.380> Glock<00:05:59.800> because<00:06:00.370> you

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
to something like a Glock because you

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.730 
to something like a Glock because you
know<00:06:01.390> you<00:06:01.780> get<00:06:01.960> to<00:06:01.990> finger<00:06:02.380> on<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.590> trigger

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
know you get to finger on the trigger

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.040 
know you get to finger on the trigger
and<00:06:02.950> it's<00:06:03.220> gonna<00:06:03.400> go<00:06:03.610> off<00:06:03.850> so<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.750> know<00:06:04.840> it's

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
and it's gonna go off so you know it's

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.500 
and it's gonna go off so you know it's
kind<00:06:05.320> of<00:06:05.790> people<00:06:06.790> think<00:06:07.000> you're<00:06:07.090> nuts<00:06:07.300> for

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
kind of people think you're nuts for

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.770 
kind of people think you're nuts for
carrying<00:06:07.840> a<00:06:07.900> 1911<00:06:08.260> but<00:06:08.830> in<00:06:09.370> my<00:06:09.520> opinion<00:06:10.000> it's<00:06:10.570> a

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
carrying a 1911 but in my opinion it's a

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.400 
carrying a 1911 but in my opinion it's a
safer<00:06:11.260> way<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.410> travel<00:06:11.560> so<00:06:12.419> you<00:06:13.419> know<00:06:13.810> sound

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
safer way to travel so you know sound

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:15.870 
safer way to travel so you know sound
