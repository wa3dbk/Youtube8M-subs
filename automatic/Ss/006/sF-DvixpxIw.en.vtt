 since our departure we give you the 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.650
 Welcome to this Dominican artist who 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.630
 I was based outside for a few months 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.870
 working what now comes to 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.080
 present ourselves to our country clearly 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:22.030
 Dominican to love the black and thank you 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.449
 Thank you for a while I was here 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.949

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.760
 and you who tells me long ago that you do not 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:41.420
 I see what has been commented as new 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 quite if it's worth payrolls actually the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 change was made for the music video it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.940
 did also for a few jobs 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.739
 what am I doing in the cinema and then 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.620
 nothing I always said from the beginning 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.399
 that the change of then pulled out the braids 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.590
 it was only for my new single that 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.270
 is well Jamaican then I thought that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.309
 It would be cool to change a little bit though 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.660
 today I understand to speak to me about that new 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.000
 theme a world 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.580
 how come the idea of ​​where why 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.690
 good first 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.920
 and now four times one says a day and 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.740
 then look basically is my new 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.869
 simple is the original theme is called xe 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.000
 knitting with the international artist does not 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.680
 equino mestre begues is an artist who 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.220
 radios with somport has another issue with 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.230
 Beyonce is an artist 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 for me it is an honor that has given me the 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.590
 opportunity to work with him and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 for nothing I made my own version that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.010
 I was resting vacationing but the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.320
 truth is that it was not like that is that it is that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.450
