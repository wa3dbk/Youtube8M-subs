00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
all of our widgets and as you can see

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.210 
all of our widgets and as you can see
here<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> default<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.829> set<00:01:44.100> up

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
here these are the default one set up

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
here these are the default one set up
now<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.759> rearrange<00:01:45.090> them<00:01:45.450> by<00:01:45.600> dragging

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
now we can rearrange them by dragging

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.080 
now we can rearrange them by dragging
those<00:01:46.079> little<00:01:46.350> bars<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> side<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> moving

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
those little bars on the side and moving

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
those little bars on the side and moving
them<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.990> those<00:01:49.140> changes<00:01:49.619> reflect

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
them and you see those changes reflect

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.219 
them and you see those changes reflect
immediately<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.509> Notification<00:01:52.200> Center

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
immediately in the Notification Center

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
immediately in the Notification Center
so<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.009> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> organize<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.299> how

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
so we can kind of organize these how

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
so we can kind of organize these how
we'd<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.500> can<00:01:55.619> also<00:01:55.829> add<00:01:56.219> actions<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
we'd like but we can also add actions to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
we'd like but we can also add actions to
it<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.439> could

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
it now think about what you could

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
it now think about what you could
possibly<00:01:59.130> add<00:01:59.399> to<00:02:00.090> act<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.420> widget<00:02:00.570> basically

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
possibly add to act a widget basically

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
possibly add to act a widget basically
anything<00:02:01.710> anything<00:02:02.159> that's<00:02:02.430> available<00:02:02.610> for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
anything anything that's available for

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.630 
anything anything that's available for
activator<00:02:03.540> anyway<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.649> all<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
activator anyway here we have all of the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
activator anyway here we have all of the
actions<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.509> choose<00:02:06.719> from<00:02:06.899> now

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
actions that we can choose from now

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
actions that we can choose from now
let's<00:02:07.799> go<00:02:07.979> ahead<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> check<00:02:08.789> something<00:02:09.090> out

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
let's go ahead and check something out

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
let's go ahead and check something out
here<00:02:09.539> real<00:02:09.660> quick<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.739> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
here real quick this is actually kind of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.610 
here real quick this is actually kind of
neat<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.580> scroll<00:02:11.879> down<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> bottom

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
neat if we scroll down to the bottom

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.110 
neat if we scroll down to the bottom
let's<00:02:14.129> find<00:02:14.430> where<00:02:14.879> virtual<00:02:15.480> assistant<00:02:16.080> is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
let's find where virtual assistant is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.000 
let's find where virtual assistant is
virtual<00:02:18.120> assistant<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.349> are<00:02:19.470> going<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.830> set

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
virtual assistant so we are going to set

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.210 
virtual assistant so we are going to set
it<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.459> invoke<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.510> virtual<00:02:21.989> assistant

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
it up to invoke the virtual assistant

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.670 
it up to invoke the virtual assistant
when<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.459> tap<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.660> widget<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.500> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
when we tap on this widget up here so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.280 
when we tap on this widget up here so
let's<00:02:25.860> go<00:02:26.069> over<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> side<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:28.140> will

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
let's go over to the side and we will

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.039 
let's go over to the side and we will
tap<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.769> virtual<00:02:29.340> assistant<00:02:29.879> right<00:02:30.239> away<00:02:30.480> we

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
tap on virtual assistant right away we

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.140 
tap on virtual assistant right away we
can<00:02:31.319> invoke<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.129> virtual<00:02:32.549> assistant<00:02:32.940> just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
can invoke the virtual assistant just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140 
can invoke the virtual assistant just
like<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.349> we<00:02:34.410> can<00:02:34.590> also<00:02:34.950> layer<00:02:35.370> these<00:02:35.640> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
like that now we can also layer these so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.030 
like that now we can also layer these so
I<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.780> virtual<00:02:37.170> assistant<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.739> first

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
I have virtual assistant here first

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.220 
I have virtual assistant here first
let's<00:02:38.610> go<00:02:38.760> ahead<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.090> tap<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.629> take

let's go ahead and tap on take
screenshot<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.549> now<00:02:41.790> we<00:02:41.849> have<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.299> layered<00:02:42.569> and

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
screenshot so now we have it layered and

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
screenshot so now we have it layered and
as<00:02:43.200> you'll<00:02:43.379> see<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.739> side<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.700> both

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
as you'll see on the side we have both

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.270 
as you'll see on the side we have both
of<00:02:45.360> those<00:02:45.569> icons<00:02:46.049> stacked<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.709> top<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:47.160> each

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
of those icons stacked on top of each

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.910 
of those icons stacked on top of each
other<00:02:47.430> right<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.450> if<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.810> tap<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.319> as

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
other right here so if I tap on that as

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.089 
other right here so if I tap on that as
you<00:02:49.980> saw<00:02:50.370> there<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.290> launched<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.560> personal

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
you saw there it launched the personal

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.370 
you saw there it launched the personal
assistant<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.849> also<00:02:54.090> took<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.720> screen<00:02:55.079> shot

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
assistant and it also took a screen shot

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.140 
assistant and it also took a screen shot
which<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.099> can<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.670> we<00:02:56.700> go<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
which you can see if we go in the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.259 
which you can see if we go in the
screenshots<00:02:57.660> here<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.799> have<00:02:59.099> our<00:02:59.489> screen<00:02:59.940> shot

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
screenshots here we have our screen shot

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.080 
screenshots here we have our screen shot
taken<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.769> specific<00:03:02.519> moment<00:03:02.910> right

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
taken of that specific moment right

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.750 
taken of that specific moment right
there<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.540> let's<00:03:03.569> go<00:03:03.900> ahead<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.500> get<00:03:05.340> out<00:03:05.519> of

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
there so let's go ahead and get out of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.729 
there so let's go ahead and get out of
that<00:03:05.910> let's<00:03:06.390> try<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.660> one<00:03:06.840> more<00:03:07.049> time<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.560> we

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that let's try it one more time here we

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.819 
that let's try it one more time here we
will<00:03:08.129> tap<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.629> virtual<00:03:10.260> assistant<00:03:10.349> and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
will tap on the virtual assistant and

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.670 
will tap on the virtual assistant and
take<00:03:11.040> screen<00:03:11.400> shot<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:13.349> you<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.560> that's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
take screen shot so there you go that's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.890 
take screen shot so there you go that's
another<00:03:13.980> good<00:03:14.280> example<00:03:14.459> we<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.450> both

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
another good example we can have both

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.530 
another good example we can have both
actions<00:03:16.470> performed<00:03:16.799> at<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.430> same<00:03:17.700> time<00:03:18.060> using

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
actions performed at the same time using

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.330 
actions performed at the same time using
these<00:03:18.870> intelligent<00:03:19.680> layers<00:03:19.859> here<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.190> we

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
these intelligent layers here and we

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.099 
these intelligent layers here and we
have<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.609> next<00:03:20.730> screen<00:03:21.060> shot<00:03:21.299> right<00:03:21.900> there

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
have the next screen shot right there

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.259 
have the next screen shot right there
it's<00:03:22.500> very<00:03:22.680> very<00:03:23.400> cool<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> ability

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
it's very very cool I like the ability

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.330 
it's very very cool I like the ability
to<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.720> able<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.959> layer<00:03:25.290> these<00:03:25.859> actions

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
to be able to layer these actions
