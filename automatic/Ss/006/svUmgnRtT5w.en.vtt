got a pond that they live in and then
they<00:04:03.090> come<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.299> on<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.629> sandy<00:04:04.049> beach<00:04:04.079> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440

come back to where they were born the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.460 
come back to where they were born the
turtles<00:04:12.060> can't<00:04:12.269> get<00:04:12.419> through<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.780> fence<00:04:13.019> is

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
turtles can't get through the fence is

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.080 
turtles can't get through the fence is
it<00:04:13.769> good<00:04:14.040> enough<00:04:14.129> just<00:04:14.549> to<00:04:14.609> get<00:04:14.760> close<00:04:15.060> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
it good enough just to get close and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.670 
it good enough just to get close and
come<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.840> real<00:04:16.049> beach<00:04:16.289> here<00:04:16.500> at<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
come to the real beach here at the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.189 
come to the real beach here at the
Caymans<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.389> know<00:04:18.539> these<00:04:18.780> Turtles

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
Caymans you know we know these Turtles

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.170 
Caymans you know we know these Turtles
are<00:04:19.349> swimming<00:04:19.889> great<00:04:20.130> distances<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.669> somehow

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
are swimming great distances and somehow

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.940 
are swimming great distances and somehow
making<00:04:21.719> their<00:04:21.870> way<00:04:21.989> back<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.530> their<00:04:22.620> natal

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
making their way back to their natal

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.850 
making their way back to their natal
beaches<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.030> how<00:04:24.150> do<00:04:24.210> they<00:04:24.360> do<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.740> that's<00:04:25.740> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
beaches so how do they do that that's a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.529 
beaches so how do they do that that's a
good<00:04:26.010> question<00:04:26.159> one<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.180> thoughts<00:04:27.390> is

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
good question one of the thoughts is

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.880 
good question one of the thoughts is
that<00:04:27.599> they<00:04:27.870> navigate<00:04:28.320> they<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.620> some

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
that they navigate they have some

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.550 
that they navigate they have some
magnetic<00:04:29.159> sense<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.210> they're<00:04:30.330> able<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.630> sense

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
magnetic sense and they're able to sense

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.339 
magnetic sense and they're able to sense
magnetic<00:04:31.830> fields<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.990> navigate<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.200> way

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
magnetic fields and navigate in that way

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.219 
magnetic fields and navigate in that way
there<00:04:35.340> may<00:04:35.520> be<00:04:35.550> chemosensory<00:04:36.150> receptors<00:04:37.140> that

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
there may be chemosensory receptors that

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.040 
there may be chemosensory receptors that
are<00:04:37.380> like<00:04:38.280> salmon<00:04:38.729> helping<00:04:39.270> them<00:04:39.419> find<00:04:39.780> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
are like salmon helping them find a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.130 
are like salmon helping them find a
scent<00:04:40.680> associated<00:04:41.580> with<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.820> Beach<00:04:42.140> with

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
scent associated with that Beach with

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.350 
scent associated with that Beach with
that<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.380> mind<00:04:43.590> we<00:04:43.800> use<00:04:44.039> the<00:04:44.370> same<00:04:44.610> sand<00:04:45.060> from

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
that in mind we use the same sand from

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.510 
that in mind we use the same sand from
seven<00:04:45.630> mile<00:04:45.750> beach<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.289> our<00:04:46.560> nesting<00:04:46.950> boxes<00:04:47.340> so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
seven mile beach in our nesting boxes so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.120 
seven mile beach in our nesting boxes so
if<00:04:47.760> there<00:04:47.969> isn't<00:04:48.120> imprinting<00:04:48.750> effect<00:04:49.500> we<00:04:49.950> want

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
if there isn't imprinting effect we want

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.350 
if there isn't imprinting effect we want
it<00:04:50.219> to<00:04:50.310> happen<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.820> they're<00:04:51.000> sensing

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
it to happen if they're sensing

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.300 
it to happen if they're sensing
something<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.900> sand<00:04:52.140> that's<00:04:52.620> they<00:04:52.830> know

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
something in the sand that's they know

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.730 
something in the sand that's they know
the<00:04:53.430> general<00:04:53.789> area<00:04:53.909> the<00:04:54.240> beaches<00:04:54.659> here<00:04:55.440> on<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
certain part of Cayman Island so they're

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.029 
certain part of Cayman Island so they're
coming<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:57.570> this<00:04:57.690> area<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.260> lo<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:58.890> behold

coming to this area and lo and behold
are<00:04:59.400> getting<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.669> same<00:04:59.820> sand<00:05:00.120> they<00:05:00.240> were<00:05:00.300> born

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
are getting the same sand they were born

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.440 
are getting the same sand they were born
in<00:05:00.750> even<00:05:01.440> though<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:01.680> been<00:05:01.830> moved<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.370> few<00:05:02.550> how

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
in even though it's been moved a few how

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.370 
in even though it's been moved a few how
far<00:05:03.659> away<00:05:03.870> from<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.110> beach<00:05:04.260> here<00:05:05.840> okay<00:05:06.840> so

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
far away from the beach here okay so

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.080 
far away from the beach here okay so
they're<00:05:07.560> there<00:05:07.800> within<00:05:07.950> 200<00:05:08.520> yards<00:05:08.550> where

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
they're there within 200 yards where

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.180 
they're there within 200 yards where
they<00:05:09.180> started<00:05:09.599> they<00:05:09.990> lay<00:05:10.169> roughly<00:05:10.979> how<00:05:11.130> many

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
they started they lay roughly how many

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.020 
they started they lay roughly how many
eggs<00:05:11.520> each<00:05:12.030> time<00:05:12.330> they<00:05:13.139> raise<00:05:13.440> 80<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.580> 100<00:05:14.909> eggs

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
eggs each time they raise 80 to 100 eggs

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.990 
eggs each time they raise 80 to 100 eggs
80<00:05:15.450> to<00:05:15.630> 100<00:05:15.960> eggs<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.440> your<00:05:16.919> breeding<00:05:17.460> turtles

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
80 to 100 eggs and your breeding turtles

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.270 
80 to 100 eggs and your breeding turtles
would<00:05:18.180> do<00:05:18.300> this<00:05:18.479> how<00:05:19.080> often<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.800> season<00:05:20.190> do

it's<00:06:21.150> difficult<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.750> think<00:06:22.169> if<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.529> listen<00:06:22.680> to

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
it's difficult I think if you listen to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.830 
it's difficult I think if you listen to
the<00:06:22.950> talk<00:06:23.130> shows<00:06:23.400> and<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:24.000> subject<00:06:24.450> comes<00:06:24.659> up

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.350 
the talk shows and the subject comes up
and<00:06:25.080> young<00:06:25.349> callers<00:06:25.889> call<00:06:26.340> in<00:06:26.370> you<00:06:27.000> might<00:06:27.180> find

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
and young callers call in you might find

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.389 
and young callers call in you might find
that<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.659> younger<00:06:27.990> command<00:06:28.320> ends<00:06:28.560> are<00:06:28.740> shying

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.399 
that the younger command ends are shying

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.050

something about conservation in this
unique<00:06:41.580> resource<00:06:41.850> and<00:06:42.360> that's<00:06:42.690> very

unique resource and that's very

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.290 
unique resource and that's very
important
