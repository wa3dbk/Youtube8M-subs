00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 goals and we are going to take the direction 

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.319
 of saumur where is the museum of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.960
 shielded 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.929
 hugot clement you are next to a tank 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.030
 ft10 is who served during the great 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.759
 war and we can really talk about a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 innovation 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.500
 yes marie I am next to a chariot ft10 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.150
 is the first turret tank of 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.840
 the story and it 's manufacturing 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 French 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 it was built from 1917 by 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.529
 renault and distributed to the armies 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.390
 French and American in the six 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.550
 last months of the war between May and 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 November 1918 is also why 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 that it's called the victory chariot 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 then I'll join immediately the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.090
 lieutenant colonel pierre de labarrÃ¨re 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.340
 good day where you are 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 the curator of the armored museum of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 brine who is keeping up to June 7 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 can you explain to us 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.149
 why this tank was decisive in the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 final stretch of the great 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.629
 war then it's a chariot 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.129
 accompanying the infantry he has 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.960
 provided to cross the networks of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.610
 harass and destroy the nests of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.930
 the guns play a role 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.730
 considerable influence on the morale of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770
 fighters from the offensives as soon 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.619
 1918 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.240
 because it is reliable almost 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.100
 invulnerable anti-tank weapons 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 did not exist and which was produced in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 large quantities about 3100 at the moment 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.369
 of the armistice and this gave confidence 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.799
 to the soldiers and sally give a morale 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 very strong and the Germans missed the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.250
 check tanks the german have 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.930
 built very little because they used 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 very few are those who took 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.409
 the french the english 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 thank you so much this tank it can 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.900
 look amazing but it works 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 again we will make you the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 demonstration 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.920
 then you see the driver has not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.159
 a lot of space 1 it's very cramped 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 we're going to start the mechanics 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.930
 here he closes the armor before and he 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 will start 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.090
 it's a pretty rustic tank but it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.030
 still works it's solid 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 so it's a light tank 1 it weighs 7 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.310
 tons that is very light for a gear 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310
 armored 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.620
 so you see it's not fast 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.010
 they were going at seven kilometers an hour 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.180
 maximum but it was built at its 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.150
 course so that they can 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.650
 to cross the trenches easily there are 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.990
 a tail in the back of the tank that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.760
 allows to actually rely on the the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.770
 bottom of the trench to go up 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.820
 easily it does not get blocked then 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.170
 we have to imagine that for the driver 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.030
 it was very difficult conditions 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 one because there is no separation between 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.660
 the engine and the cockpit of which 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.310
 it was very hot and to find 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.870
 the pilot uses small shapes 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.080
 from observation to the front to see where he 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.300
 go 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 the Germans understood that 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.240
 the pilot used these centers 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.980
 of observation to find one's bearings and therefore 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.200
 that they were trying to shoot for 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.090
 injured the pilot with splinters and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.950
 that's why it looks and the pilot 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.350
 use that kind of mask so we 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.790
 would say an object of the Middle Ages with this 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.740
 mesh size but it was a good 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.450
 mask of chariot pilots of the great 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.520
 war he used that to not be 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.040
 injured by the shrapnel then the cats 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.570
 afp 17 there are several at the museum of 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.220
 armored brine and you can come 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.510
 see them all year the teams of the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.510
 museum are ready to welcome you 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.100
 this demonstration carried out beating 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.460
 ft said stÃ©phane audoin-rouzeau our 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.760
 brands 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.350
 I believe that the dryer actually 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.300
 light after the tanks much more 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.380
 heavy of the year 16 the tank begin 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.230
 the first major tank attacks 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.810
 will start this trend is strong of 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.370
 ships for earthen pottery there 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.900
 we are with a light tank so a lot 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.820
 more at once faster and less 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.960
 vulnerable that helps restore the 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.030
 movement that was the big problem 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.160
 nothing 14 how to restore movement 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.660
 is that you're charging tanks though 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.130
 relatively slow are horses of 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.600
 metal and glass a lot of riders 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.160
 besides in the tanks that say it 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.950
 very clearly we can again 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.930
 loaded and that's it actually we 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.370
 does the tanks he not the only instrument 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.440
 of victory but he would have been a 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.270
 decisive instrument from summer 18 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.330
 especially since their use did not 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.010
 cut by the German command that has 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.960
 been overwhelmed by the number of tanks their 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.540
 speed of relative relative lightness 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.370
 because previously on the other hand the artillery 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.110
 German had succeeded one of 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.300
 terrible performance against all 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.300
 seven previous in a moment
