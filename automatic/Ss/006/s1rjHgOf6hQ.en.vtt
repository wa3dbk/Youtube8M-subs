00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
referees are going to have to take a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.920 
referees are going to have to take a
look<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.400> see<00:02:43.610> what<00:02:43.820> had<00:02:43.970> happened<00:02:44.000> but

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
look at see what had happened but

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.180 
look at see what had happened but
usually<00:02:45.260> when<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.500> see<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.709> fall<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.130> that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
usually when you see a fall like that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.560 
usually when you see a fall like that
especially<00:02:46.580> towards<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.180> end<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.390> race

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
especially towards the end of the race

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.670 
especially towards the end of the race
you're<00:02:47.840> probably<00:02:48.050> looking<00:02:48.410> at<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> as

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you're probably looking at it as

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.320 
you're probably looking at it as
qualification<00:02:49.430> okay<00:02:49.850> well<00:02:50.000> let's<00:02:50.150> go<00:02:50.300> back

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
qualification okay well let's go back

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.030 
qualification okay well let's go back
through<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.840> end<00:02:50.989> here<00:02:51.230> here<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.650> oh<00:02:51.860> no

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
through the end here here is oh no

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.310 
through the end here here is oh no
pushing<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.820> lead<00:02:53.150> very<00:02:53.450> powerful<00:02:54.200> very

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
pushing to the lead very powerful very

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.350 
pushing to the lead very powerful very
mole<00:02:54.769> as<00:02:55.010> he<00:02:55.130> goes<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.550> outside<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.209> really

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
mole as he goes on the outside it really

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.000 
mole as he goes on the outside it really
does<00:02:56.600> he<00:02:56.750> makes<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.110> look<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.440> lot<00:02:57.590> easier<00:02:57.650> than

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
does he makes it look a lot easier than

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.740 
does he makes it look a lot easier than
it<00:02:58.160> actually<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.820> pass<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> outside

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
it actually is the pass on the outside

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.120 
it actually is the pass on the outside
obviously<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.470> be<00:03:00.560> going<00:03:00.769> faster

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
obviously you have to be going faster

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.710 
obviously you have to be going faster
than<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.310> other<00:03:01.430> skaters<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.390> when<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.600> do

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
than the other skaters but when you do

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.330 
than the other skaters but when you do
that<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.019> come<00:03:03.200> by<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> lot<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.950> speed<00:03:04.160> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that you come by with a lot of speed and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.070 
that you come by with a lot of speed and
get<00:03:04.519> some<00:03:04.700> separation<00:03:04.880> now<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.810> what

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
get some separation now this is what

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.250 
get some separation now this is what
happens<00:03:06.410> as<00:03:06.530> apollo<00:03:07.010> ohno<00:03:07.250> crosses<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> line

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
happens as apollo ohno crosses the line

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.360 
happens as apollo ohno crosses the line
and<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.380> looks<00:03:09.590> like<00:03:09.680> there's<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.340> be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and it looks like there's going to be

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.949 
and it looks like there's going to be
this<00:03:10.519> qualification<00:03:11.090> when<00:03:11.600> you<00:03:11.690> see<00:03:11.870> if

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
this qualification when you see if

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.600 
this qualification when you see if
travel<00:03:12.380> especially<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.220> end<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.459> race

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
travel especially at the end of the race

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.280 
travel especially at the end of the race
you<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.330> count<00:03:14.540> somebody's<00:03:14.989> going<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.170> get

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
you can count somebody's going to get

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.840 
you can count somebody's going to get
this<00:03:15.410> qualifier<00:03:15.890> but<00:03:16.160> he's<00:03:16.310> fighting<00:03:16.610> for<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
this qualifier but he's fighting for the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.539 
this qualifier but he's fighting for the
same<00:03:17.030> bit<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.660> ice<00:03:17.810> oh<00:03:18.170> no<00:03:19.100> didn't<00:03:19.340> have<00:03:19.430> any
