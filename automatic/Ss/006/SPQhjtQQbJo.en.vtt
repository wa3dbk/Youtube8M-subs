00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all and wonders in a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.830
 show you how to make a fox in 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.070
 origami 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:16.289
 to start you take a leaf 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:24.109
 and origami like that and you fold it in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.109
 diagonal in one direction and the other 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.830
 is a fervent holder in a sense and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.830
 in the other 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:46.500
 then for noise and you turn down the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:49.800
 there are three in the middle this is you 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.379
 turn over your figure and plan 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.469
 again the four corners to the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.469
 middle 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.720
 here 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.160
 then you took away so 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.050
 big tournaments figure you were taking 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:35.990
 parties and mossy ears is giving himself a 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:40.890
 crown shape you take a part 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:49.680
 you make as few companies 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 it's like that and we do the same thing on the other 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890
 side 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:15.000
 so here it is that gives you your 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:17.420
 fox to color small eyes 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.420
 above 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:45.480
 to do the yoyo this is a fox 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.480
 a little comic top with big 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:55.590
 ears but I think it's very 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:59.510
 tight too thank you for watching this 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.510
 video and see you soon
