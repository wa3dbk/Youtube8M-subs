00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 lol here today i talk about 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.799
 decision 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.010
 and what have the disc with games too 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.750
 what does that have to do with being better 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.690
 yes the thing is in many games 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
 mutated forced to make a decision eg in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.070
 starcraft you have to build something 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 you do not have to comply with tree 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.689
 attack or what defensive farmer 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.000
 you always have to do something 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.510
 decide in the complete ins is it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.930
 but not quite so clearly you 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.750
 move you make him decide what 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.290
 but for that there are very many 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.120
 things that happen unconsciously and over 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.770
 many players do not even think 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.079
 and that is the problem you have to do if 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 it's about making decisions 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 think about it exactly where do I want 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.329
 make a decision 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 and where I possibly no 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.100
 make a decision but if it is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.680
 make me feel 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 In fact, the issuer is a player 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.850
 that is spiritual in purple is mechanical 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 already as good as perfect 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.700
 mechanics is about which users like 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.400
 you're strange praga there's 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.549
 skillshots and so on that's all 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 details and that's why many think 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.080
 player hey I'm silver but that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450
 are all just lazy they play with me 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.170
 I'm actually already 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.579
 diamond and adapt because it's easy 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.799
 does not look hard what that 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.750
 make predictions there and no idea 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.740
 but the decision and a decision 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.060
 decision can be for example 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.299
 Do not commit murder or not 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.340
 cuddly a lame or a hairdresser or 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:58.250
 I just do only print alone 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.829
 are very very difficult decision 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.969
 I can smile about that 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.030
 to make video 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.479
 this is very complex one wall when 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.479
 it does 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.370
 and many decisions on the spot 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.280
 actually become so automatic 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.639
 made clear new playful no 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.069
 worte 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.510
 but at some point you can see yes ok with it in 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.680
 my roll is put in the desk 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.530
 then I just wanted that in my case 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.900
 it is quite good 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.099
 you already understood the game 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 said marco bushman old man river 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.819
 plate was cool but now it goes into 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.879
 detail this is the point where you are better 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.359
 could be and that 's about it 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.949
 self description apply 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.790
 You should be aware of it 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:52.590
 where i make no decision 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.079
 and where do I want none at all 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.530
 make a decision and where to find one 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:02.000
 make a decision eg when buying 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.579
 I do not want to decide at the beginning 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.189
 what I want to buy as a new player wants 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.019
 I buy money for a brand new one 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.239
 Player buys something that ever 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.009
 very bad that is from one 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.379
 certain time I said leave me 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.250
 rather take the decision 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.689
 rather than no decision at all 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.250
 meet or against a black list 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:27.930
 I have the decision to lose weight and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.720
 purchase always comes when you now 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.639
 gets better and thinks great you can 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.139
 start sometime, for example 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:39.150
 buy defensive itunes 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:43.319
 after opponents or after who endangers 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.419
 is or how many have done with it 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.790
 or whatever that means it already 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.750
 a little easier so a right 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.439
 simple decision 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:57.419
 ok i buy defensive items from now on 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:59.400
 after opponents that ever quite 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.060
 Well that means you are thinking about that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.019
 you what you do he does something right 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.099
 hopefully right if you are 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.250
 thought about it 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.180
 But the first step is ever 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.299
 determine where you thought 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.439
 must do and often are the position 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.579
 not as obvious as that 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:21.669
 Shopping because good at shopping 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:24.430
 clearly you have to buy then do you 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.710
 Keep decisions then you need 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.410
 you okay I not take buy now 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.009
 like crysis when it's next to the full hd 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.470
 okay but many decisions are for 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.060
 Example of what ok like actually wanted 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.229
 I'm always tragic but I have 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.530
 actually noticed that brings nothing 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.330
 because we die because they are too far 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.740
 pushing because I do not need already 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.630
 First of all, it is very courageous 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.699
 now just an example of what you get 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.000
 To really do an example is okay 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:01.870
 my opponent there is the singer left 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.889
 hin hin in my experiences begins 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.510
 always at red bull 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.100
 that means he knows two minutes ago 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.490
 I do not even lean in the bot 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.820
 his 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.110
 it takes longer than you want 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.570
 the other way for the top ten 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.900
 I have to go the first two minutes 30 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.550
 I do not want the other way I wanted right away 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.210
 that means I start a decision 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.979
 hold true 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.740
 and when i first murder for example 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:27.460
 Place had a half minutes later 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:32.830
 I myself saved the word so 35 gold 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:35.680
 little more stuff but there 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.479
 starts and then I always put 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.599
 again possible or there I put 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.060
 somewhere where normally not really 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.599
 word because I'm there in them only 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.030
 has a premonition or something else 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.220
 And that makes a difference to the players 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:55.360
 always cause situation 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.220
 that are positive for the team and the learners 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.940
 in the end these are themselves 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.260
 statistically then take off because they always 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.620
 Make a good decision again 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.720
 A good decision does not always mean 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.120
 sorted something good anyway 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.250
 a good decision can say , for example, hey 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:19.270
 To 80% I kill the opponent and come 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.729
 of it and to 20 percent I stay 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.240
 just the death 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.639
 it can happen 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.389
 that is, if in this 20 percent 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.139
 ends up packing then he has had bad luck 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.039
 does not mean that all decisions 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.840
 was wrong 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:40.449
 that means you have to know what's up 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:43.160
 is often good and yes just found 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.370
 to think about it exactly 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.289
 how with small things where can i 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.360
 maybe what does not do maybe 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.560
 Do what closing but in yours 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.069
 skill level does not make it at all 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.880
 sense 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.470
 maybe they are always following something 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.490
 now constantly the motto ask me 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:06.949
 can not draw anything from it 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:12.789
 yes exactly took place at about the race only 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:17.389
 with buddy door and thus better to 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:19.599
 until the next episode episode that she 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.599
 call
