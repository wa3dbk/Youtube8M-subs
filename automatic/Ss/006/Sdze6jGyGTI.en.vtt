 us here on television and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.699

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 History in Aguascalientes was registered 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.860
 a clash between a pipe and a train 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.200
 let's see 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.540
 about 25,000 liters spilled from 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.250
 large amounts of material damage was the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.900
 balance left by the collision between a tract 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.090
 double tanker truck and the train in 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.850
 aguascalientes we build ourselves to this 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.780
 place we found that in the part 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.360
 rear of the tank brought double 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.510
 how locally we know each other when 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.600
 this chicha and in the part of stick in the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 back to the last sausage is 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 in the way that they beat you for the 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.690
 back corner and turn to the second 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 sausage because they registered in 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.170
 with the constitution on the avenue 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.820
 aguascalientes I remember with the witnesses 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.140
 of the accident came after the 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.970
 mark the stop light 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100
 several drivers stopped that the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.530
 pipe driver will be traversed in 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.159
 the train tracks tried nothing more than 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.249
 not being able to fight 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.079
 in good part the last part ni 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:15.060
 not even the sausage then 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.979
 like the back defense then that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.630
 it was enough for them to turn around 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.850
 Although the identified machinist 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.170
 go ahead for the row of cars that comes 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.780
 the site so the impact was 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 inevitable neighbors of the area arrived 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.590

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.719
 they improvised to fill them before 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.929
 that the milk touch the milk 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.989
 was pouring now old the 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:46.049
 pipe but this is good with safety and 

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:47.659
 all I could really people because 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.379
 take advantage of the milk that was thrown 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.539
