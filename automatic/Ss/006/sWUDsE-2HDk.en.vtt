00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.209 
now what you can do is use a spoon to
just<00:02:00.060> keep<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> whites<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.140> over<00:02:01.950> top<00:02:02.189> of

just keep the whites right over top of
the<00:02:02.579> yoke<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.299> will<00:02:03.509> make<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.929> prettier

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319
