twenty<00:01:35.660> dollars<00:01:35.990> ah<00:01:37.000> good<00:01:38.000> tracker<00:01:38.620> so<00:01:39.620> this

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
twenty dollars ah good tracker so this

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.780 
twenty dollars ah good tracker so this
is<00:01:40.460> thickening<00:01:41.000> up<00:01:41.210> just<00:01:41.480> nicely<00:01:41.690> actually

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.110 

so<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.750> how<00:01:45.780> thick<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
so see how thick that is and then one of

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.420 
so see how thick that is and then one of
the<00:01:48.300> tricks<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.840> see<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.710> coats<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> back<00:01:50.190> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the tricks is see it coats the back of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.070 
the tricks is see it coats the back of
the<00:01:50.520> spatula<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.120> if<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.330> run<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.720> finger

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
the spatula that if you run your finger

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.330 
the spatula that if you run your finger
through<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:54.180> holds<00:01:54.510> alive<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.190> when

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
through it it holds alive so that's when

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.520 
through it it holds alive so that's when
you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.550> it's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
you know it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.890 
you know it's
so<00:01:59.530> I<00:01:59.560> pour<00:02:00.070> this<00:02:00.280> over<00:02:00.550> those<00:02:01.300> chocolate

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
so I pour this over those chocolate

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.220 
so I pour this over those chocolate
chips<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.090> melts<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.780> reason<00:02:05.140> I

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
chips so that it melts and the reason I

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.490 
chips so that it melts and the reason I
put<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.560> through<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> sieve<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.900> not<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.140> sin

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
put it through a sieve this is not a sin

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.460 
put it through a sieve this is not a sin
it's<00:02:08.800> okay<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.850> might<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.660> few<00:02:10.930> bits<00:02:11.170> here

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
it's okay you might have a few bits here

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's okay you might have a few bits here
