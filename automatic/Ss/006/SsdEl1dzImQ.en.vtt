00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.830
 the sweet home 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.830
 the love action 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:15.030
 of opinions and criticisms that have 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.480
 improved is good we started to upload a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.480
 input 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.530
 a game called smart and I was going to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.530
 download the file 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.410
 this file is extracted 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.250
 are going to have these two files which 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.250
 they will not open it with another iso 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.140
 is mounted on the virtual drive I come in 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:49.240
 the disk that has stored 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.190
 in my case it is the only one that rides 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.610
 and there is no need to have this 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 open 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.559
 we give him auto play 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.740
 I have it installed 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.330
 and once this is going to look like everything 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 this except for this 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.210
 in the description I will also put it 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.210
 7 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.850
 that file that was to run the game 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.850
 they will come 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.100
 of smooth level 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.670
 A) Yes 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.780
 and they extract it 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.780
 and that file 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.780
 and they're going to paste it into the folder where 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 they put 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.490
 once this the game caught them without 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.490
 problems 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.870
 I use windows 7 I really have no idea 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.870
 for windows 8 as in any way 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 Well, I hope 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.220
