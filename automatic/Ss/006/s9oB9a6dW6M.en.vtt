00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.540
 the new fiat case is is new fiat 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.380
 road is ready to be launched 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.110
 now in the year 2013 but will only be 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.780
 a restyling of the road which is 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.050
 currently produced or that is 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.520
 same platform of the 1996 palio or 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 be it a very old platform 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.390
 the monoblock of this car, then I 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.769
 I believe that fitch will do the latter 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.510
 stylization before launching the new 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.289
 road will be based on the same 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.600
 platform of the new pallium in the 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:45.069
 then the one that will be released now in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.079
 year of 2010 will be a last 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:51.569
 restyling this arrival of the new 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.569
 really new model, right? 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.209
 so this is it and some photos of 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.769
 projections as will right it will have three 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:02.589
 doors right 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:06.310
 on one side two doors on the other side 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:11.050
 only the engines will continue to be the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 and rest torque will only change to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.660
 up to these little things is a 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.160
 little of the interior 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.410
 but what is worth waiting for the year that 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.730
 comes 2014 when it comes to a new 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.250
 road right 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.410
 based on the new fully 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.560
 totally new refurbished 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.750
 Of course it will keep the engines etorq 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.050
 Rear spring beam is obvious no more 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.970
 will be a vain to use a new monoblock is 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.260
 a new platform will be a car 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.820
 safer and get to the next un come 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740
 see how it goes out in collision tests 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.430
 But I think it will be a lot better than this. 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.040
 current model, but what to say is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 that fiat goes from step now on the road 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.979
 current will keep it still the one 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.620
 96 platform to give a survival 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.120
 on the model until the arrival of the new 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.520
 being developed 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.349
 perhaps next year next year 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.000
 and not only that I wanted to say 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.000
 until the next video
