00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.330
 What's up friends 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.210
 welcome to the episode number 28 of the shock my name luciani match I will 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.599
 I'm going to talk about exposure compensation 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.180
 when we work in any traumatic way the measurement of light the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.330
 performs the camera's photometer 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.640
 depending on the characteristics of the object could situation that we go to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.690
 photographing the photometer to the camera can take a wrong reading and this 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 it will translate into flat photographs 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.540
 the cures 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.770
 If we photograph clear situations, our photography will tend to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.450
 to be in the dark and if on the contrary we photographed dark situations 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.950
 Photographs will tend to be very clear 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.680
 to solve this problem all digital SLR cameras and a lot 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 compact has a function called exposure compensation that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.940
 Indicate with this image 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 the procedure is very simple the photometer the death attacked the visible 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.010
 on the back screen ok through the camera viewfinder 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.620
 is rated -2 ​​syringing and time flexi work indicating the position 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.530
 current 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 we must go do more if we want clearer photography or so at least 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.530
 if we want darker photographs 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.549
 to please this we have to press the priority button sorry button 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.270
 of ecom replacement times 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.450
 that are there 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 together with him and the front of the camera going to the side or towards 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.800
 the other depending on what we want to achieve 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.500
 then if the photograph initially a little clear madness we apply a 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 Exposure compensation and we make a new picture 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.510
 yes this photograph that sands door fantastic if I want a little clear 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.140
 dark we apply a little more rewards of exposure 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 I take a new picture until we achieve the correct position 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.499
 that's all practice enough because this is a very useful function very 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.549
 easy to use and they will need it very much 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.879
