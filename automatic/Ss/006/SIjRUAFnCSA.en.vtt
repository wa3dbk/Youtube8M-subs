 Well this one looks very good ok 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 let's start here and mark the point 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.800
 is for many it 's right here and they can 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 see here that we have a few 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 mountains and it is very beautiful simply 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 a little one lived from the cid so there was 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.210
 more or less that they get the game 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 we have about four trees here 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.630
 we have some mountains and it is very, very 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 very beautiful in this part we have a 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.920
 beach and then nothing more simply a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.720
 been a bit normal and we may have 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.130
 a floating mountain that stays very but 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.400
 very nice so let's wait for that 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.170
 generated and not generated that was generated 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.760
 so we'll go to the spa point 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 many here because what brings us 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 this if that call it so we went down 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.560
 in this part quote and remember in 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.850
 December with its materials with a peak 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.830
 of stone that was carried to go down 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 so here we go a little 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
 quickie to finish with this video 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.580
 so we went down guys a little bit 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 gravel we go fast and in this part 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.920
 we have to slow down because not the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 I want to remove ok 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.300
 we go down and here we are going to find the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.860
 diamonds and maybe we have a little bit of 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.210
 reason so let's see to tell 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.830
 we have a little iron so that we 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.810
 help remove the diamonds ok that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:39.780
 we have for boys but now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 that we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 beautiful of 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.930
 lovers and if we go down more here 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.040
 we'll have a little sonja network that a lot 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.160
 people like me too so 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 we have 1 2 3 4 of the rest and because this one is 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320
 I recommend it a lot so that 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.850
 people who want to start playing 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 minecraft pib or something is very easy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.910
 to get the diamonds and then I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.920
 he liked to start with those and 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.090
 misery so nothing here we go to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.619
 keep watching if we have more diamonds 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.940
 so remember that we comments 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.950
 so let me what do you think about 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.240
 be more and if you send me or else live 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.920
 If so, here we have this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's see boys 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.450
