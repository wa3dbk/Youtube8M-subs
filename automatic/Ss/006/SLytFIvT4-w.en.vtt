let<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> little<00:01:12.890> bit<00:01:13.130> spill<00:01:13.490> out<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:17.450> like<00:01:17.600> to

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
let a little bit spill out we like to

let a little bit spill out we like to
attach<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.110> timer<00:01:18.409> to<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.860> log<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.460> you<00:01:19.520> know

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
attach a timer to the log so you know

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.649 
attach a timer to the log so you know
the<00:01:20.840> first<00:01:21.140> time<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:21.800> it's<00:01:22.210> actually<00:01:23.210> hit<00:01:23.630> a

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
the first time that it's actually hit a

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.070 
the first time that it's actually hit a
lot<00:01:23.869> of<00:01:23.899> times<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:24.409> gets<00:01:24.530> hit<00:01:25.039> multiple<00:01:25.490> times

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
lot of times it gets hit multiple times

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.639 
lot of times it gets hit multiple times
but<00:01:31.000> went<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.240> down<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.450> trail<00:01:32.780> completely

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
but went right down the trail completely

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.800 
but went right down the trail completely
do<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:34.399> know<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.940> raccoons<00:01:35.450> aren't

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
do we know that the raccoons aren't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.760 
do we know that the raccoons aren't
going<00:01:35.959> to<00:01:36.020> get<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:37.600> because<00:01:38.600> it's<00:01:38.959> you<00:01:39.709> know

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
going to get in it because it's you know

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.620 
going to get in it because it's you know
the<00:01:40.039> squirrels<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.700> raccoons<00:01:40.909> liked<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the squirrels and raccoons liked the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.930 
the squirrels and raccoons liked the
stuff<00:01:41.840> just<00:01:42.080> as<00:01:42.229> much<00:01:42.380> as<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.770> Bears<00:01:42.979> do<00:01:43.280> we

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
stuff just as much as the Bears do we

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.490 
stuff just as much as the Bears do we
even<00:01:44.119> had<00:01:44.330> Coyotes<00:01:44.840> come<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:47.500> this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
even had Coyotes come in and this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.859 
even had Coyotes come in and this
basically<00:01:49.340> allows<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.420> stuff<00:01:50.690> on

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
basically allows some of the stuff on

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.569 
basically allows some of the stuff on
the<00:01:50.959> outside<00:01:50.990> for<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.799> squirrels<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
the outside for the squirrels to

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.969 
the outside for the squirrels to
actually<00:01:52.969> take<00:01:53.180> some<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.109> when<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
actually take some of it and when the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.319 
actually take some of it and when the
squirrels<00:01:55.399> do<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:55.729> they<00:01:55.909> take<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.270> they

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
squirrels do is they take and they

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.870 
squirrels do is they take and they
spread<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.780> all<00:01:56.869> around<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.259> woods<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:57.880> then

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
spread it all around the woods and then

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.840 
spread it all around the woods and then
it<00:01:59.869> just<00:02:00.079> basically<00:02:00.469> spreads<00:02:01.159> out<00:02:01.340> our<00:02:01.549> scent

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
it just basically spreads out our scent

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.700 
it just basically spreads out our scent
patterns<00:02:02.299> so<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.659> squirrels<00:02:02.960> actually<00:02:03.500> help

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
patterns so the squirrels actually help

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.900 
patterns so the squirrels actually help
us<00:02:03.829> out<00:02:04.009> with<00:02:04.869> with<00:02:07.450> casting<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.570> broader<00:02:09.910> sent

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
us out with with casting a broader sent

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.310 
us out with with casting a broader sent
area<00:02:12.040> works<00:02:13.040> pretty<00:02:13.220> good<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.670> far<00:02:14.140> can't<00:02:15.140> say

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
area works pretty good so far can't say

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.360 
area works pretty good so far can't say
as<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.709> complain<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.100> normally

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
as I can complain then we normally

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.130 
as I can complain then we normally
attach<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.760> timer<00:02:20.299> to<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:21.370> basically<00:02:23.049> when<00:02:24.049> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
attach a timer to it basically when the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.949 
attach a timer to it basically when the
timer<00:02:24.410> goes<00:02:24.530> off<00:02:24.920> we<00:02:25.220> know<00:02:25.400> okay<00:02:25.970> 1150<00:02:28.840> we<00:02:29.840> know

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
timer goes off we know okay 1150 we know

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.770 
timer goes off we know okay 1150 we know
that<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.230> hit<00:02:30.380> at<00:02:30.500> 1150<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.459> he'll<00:02:32.390> check<00:02:32.630> it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
that it hit at 1150 we he'll check it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.840 
that it hit at 1150 we he'll check it
now<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.170> see<00:02:35.470> well<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.769> am<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> p.m.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.300 

and<00:02:41.270> these<00:02:42.170> work<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and these work just like a lot of the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.620 
and these work just like a lot of the
clocks<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.270> your<00:02:44.390> dashboard

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
clocks that you have on your dashboard

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.710 
clocks that you have on your dashboard
of<00:02:45.050> your<00:02:45.080> car<00:02:46.060> basically<00:02:47.060> what<00:02:47.210> it<00:02:47.240> does<00:02:47.360> is

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
of your car basically what it does is

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
of your car basically what it does is
when<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.020> pulls<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.440> timer<00:02:48.710> trigger<00:02:49.610> out<00:02:50.740> it

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
when it pulls the timer trigger out it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.430 
when it pulls the timer trigger out it
shuts<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> clock<00:02:52.520> off<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.120> when<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.420> plug<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
shuts the clock off so when you plug the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
shuts the clock off so when you plug the
timer<00:02:54.680> trigger<00:02:55.010> back<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:57.160> goes<00:02:58.160> back<00:02:58.400> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
timer trigger back in it goes back to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.880 
timer trigger back in it goes back to
the<00:02:58.640> time<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.330> shut<00:03:00.020> off<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.620> then<00:03:00.770> you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the time that it shut off so then you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.070 
the time that it shut off so then you
just<00:03:01.100> see<00:03:01.640> what<00:03:01.820> time<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.240> was<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.750> tells<00:03:02.960> you

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
just see what time that was it tells you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.590 
just see what time that was it tells you
the<00:03:03.200> date<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.560> time<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.180> don't<00:03:05.420> let

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the date and the time and that don't let

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.530 
the date and the time and that don't let
you<00:03:05.780> know<00:03:05.930> none<00:03:06.680> last<00:03:06.890> night<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.910> eleven<00:03:08.330> last
