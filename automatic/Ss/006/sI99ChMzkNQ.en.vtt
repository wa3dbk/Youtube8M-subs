00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
into it and then I know one of the guys

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
into it and then I know one of the guys
was<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.879> medical<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.270> saved<00:01:03.570> us<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
was in medical not saved us a lot so

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
when we were down they revived us much

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
when we were down they revived us much
quicker<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.670> definitely<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.270> cool<00:01:09.510> mode

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
quicker so it's definitely a cool mode

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
quicker so it's definitely a cool mode
where<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.900> definitely<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> pick<00:01:10.860> what

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
where you definitely have to pick what

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
class you want to use and you got to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.880 
class you want to use and you got to
work<00:01:12.810> together<00:01:13.220> how<00:01:14.220> important<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.909> those

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
work together how important are those

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.330 
work together how important are those
traps<00:01:16.890> uh<00:01:17.540> they<00:01:18.540> came<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.080> handy<00:01:19.259> quite<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> bit

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
traps uh they came in handy quite a bit

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
traps uh they came in handy quite a bit
especially<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.180> set<00:01:21.420> off<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.780> flames

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
especially when you set off some flames

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
especially when you set off some flames
and<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.830> fire<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.850> uh

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and there is fire going on but uh

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
and there is fire going on but uh
there's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> couple<00:01:24.840> other<00:01:25.049> areas<00:01:25.470> too<00:01:25.500> when

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there's a couple other areas too when

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.890 
there's a couple other areas too when
you<00:01:25.920> explore<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> environment<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.420> allows

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you explore the environment that allows

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
you explore the environment that allows
you<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.380> other<00:01:28.590> things<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:29.009> well<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.189> we

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.429 
we all got together and it definitely
helped<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.250> war<00:01:48.149> hog<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.170> an

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
helped out with war hog if that's an

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
helped out with war hog if that's an
exceptionally<00:01:49.950> fun<00:01:50.130> map<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.549> me<00:01:50.670> because

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
exceptionally fun map for me because

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.980 
exceptionally fun map for me because
when<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> earn<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
when you earn the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
when you earn the
dynamic<00:01:54.990> event<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> map<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.190> mortar

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
dynamic event for that map it's a mortar

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
dynamic event for that map it's a mortar
strike<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.150> when<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.330> get<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.900> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
strike so when you get it you see a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.590 
strike so when you get it you see a
bunch<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.500> mortars<00:01:58.830> coming<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.370> randomly<00:02:00.150> onto

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
bunch of mortars coming in randomly onto

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
bunch of mortars coming in randomly onto
the<00:02:00.720> map<00:02:00.900> is<00:02:01.170> trying<00:02:01.470> like<00:02:02.130> areas<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.330> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the map is trying like areas and the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
the map is trying like areas and the
taking<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.870> people<00:02:04.230> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:05.160> remember<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> did

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
taking out people and I remember I did

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
taking out people and I remember I did
it<00:02:05.970> once<00:02:06.150> here<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.990> everyone<00:02:07.230> was<00:02:07.350> freaking

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it once here and everyone was freaking

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.990 
it once here and everyone was freaking
out<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.770> what's<00:02:07.980> going<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.460> they<00:02:08.790> couldn't

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
out like what's going on they couldn't

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.030 
out like what's going on they couldn't
figure<00:02:09.180> it<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.380> pretty<00:02:10.590> cool<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
figure it out so it's pretty cool and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.760 
figure it out so it's pretty cool and
then<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.370> open<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.670> certain<00:02:11.910> areas<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
then you can open up certain areas to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
then you can open up certain areas to
that<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.250> red<00:02:14.490> skull<00:02:14.910> either<00:02:15.270> on<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> door

that have a red skull either on the door

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.380 
that have a red skull either on the door
or<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> wall<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.820> takes<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> up<00:02:18.240> into

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
or on a wall and it takes you up into

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.050 
or on a wall and it takes you up into
new<00:02:18.600> pathways<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.040> totally<00:02:20.220> opens<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.880> new

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
new pathways and it totally opens up new

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.490 
new pathways and it totally opens up new
areas<00:02:21.090> where<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.570> sort<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.990> like<00:02:22.140> camp
