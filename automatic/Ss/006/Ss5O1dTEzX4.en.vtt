00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.160 
after I come back from Spring Break
that's<00:00:42.860> basically<00:00:43.219> gonna<00:00:43.460> be<00:00:43.550> springtime

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
that's basically gonna be springtime

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.000 
that's basically gonna be springtime
hopefully<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.290> weather<00:00:45.440> will<00:00:45.559> pick<00:00:45.830> up

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
hopefully the weather will pick up

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.710 
hopefully the weather will pick up
probably<00:00:46.430> not<00:00:46.610> but<00:00:46.820> at<00:00:46.910> least<00:00:47.060> in<00:00:47.300> my<00:00:47.450> mind

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
probably not but at least in my mind

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.650 
probably not but at least in my mind
I'll<00:00:47.900> consider<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:48.530> spring<00:00:49.360> once<00:00:50.360> spring

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
I'll consider it spring once spring

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.260 
I'll consider it spring once spring
break<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.020> over<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.550> reason<00:00:52.850> why<00:00:52.970> I<00:00:53.000> wanted

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
break is over so the reason why I wanted

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.020 
break is over so the reason why I wanted
to<00:00:53.390> do<00:00:53.510> a<00:00:53.540> protective<00:00:54.110> style<00:00:54.440> challenge

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
to do a protective style challenge

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.790 
to do a protective style challenge

very<00:01:09.860> awkward<00:01:10.340> length<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:13.810> don't

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
very awkward length right now I don't

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.450 
very awkward length right now I don't
know<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.110> doesn't<00:01:15.530> hang<00:01:15.829> enough<00:01:16.220> it's

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
know it doesn't hang enough it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.090 
know it doesn't hang enough it's
starting<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.820> hang<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:17.299> doesn't<00:01:17.600> like

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
starting to hang but it doesn't like

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.849 
starting to hang but it doesn't like
hang<00:01:19.100> enough<00:01:19.490> for<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.299> style<00:01:20.929> to<00:01:21.170> like<00:01:21.319> be<00:01:21.530> going

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
hang enough for a style to like be going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.800 
hang enough for a style to like be going
down<00:01:22.100> but<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:22.639> not<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:23.119> it's<00:01:23.329> not<00:01:23.389> a<00:01:23.509> short

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
down but it's not just it's not a short

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.590 
down but it's not just it's not a short
afro<00:01:24.170> anymore<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:24.829> can't<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:25.340> wear<00:01:26.299> a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
afro anymore so I can't just wear a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.080 
afro anymore so I can't just wear a
short<00:01:26.899> afro<00:01:27.319> so<00:01:28.189> it's<00:01:28.369> like<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.609> a<00:01:28.700> weird<00:01:28.909> place

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
short afro so it's like in a weird place

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.599 
short afro so it's like in a weird place
but<00:01:30.039> hopefully<00:01:31.039> after<00:01:31.429> 10<00:01:31.759> weeks<00:01:31.959> it'll<00:01:32.959> grow

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
but hopefully after 10 weeks it'll grow

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.629 
but hopefully after 10 weeks it'll grow
at<00:01:34.609> least<00:01:34.670> an<00:01:35.209> inch<00:01:35.539> a<00:01:36.109> full<00:01:36.709> inch<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.340> so

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
at least an inch a full inch and so

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.410 
at least an inch a full inch and so
maybe<00:01:37.819> that'll<00:01:38.060> give<00:01:38.270> me<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:39.399> little<00:01:40.399> bit<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.909> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
maybe that'll give me a little bit of a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.199 
maybe that'll give me a little bit of a
little<00:01:42.079> bit<00:01:42.229> more<00:01:42.469> length<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:43.039> work<00:01:43.340> with<00:01:43.579> when

twist out I was very disappointed with

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.150 
twist out I was very disappointed with
how<00:02:08.090> they<00:02:08.270> came<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.959> didn't<00:02:09.679> think<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.099> I

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
how they came out I didn't think that I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.100 
how they came out I didn't think that I
looked<00:02:10.429> pretty<00:02:10.670> at<00:02:10.910> all<00:02:11.090> thought<00:02:11.840> my<00:02:11.959> hair

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
looked pretty at all thought my hair

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.680 
looked pretty at all thought my hair
looked<00:02:12.290> awful<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.060> want<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.480> out<00:02:14.569> of

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
looked awful and I want to get out of

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.500 
looked awful and I want to get out of
that<00:02:14.780> mindset<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.530> think<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.120> rocking<00:02:17.120> twists

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
that mindset I think that rocking twists

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
that mindset I think that rocking twists

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.240 
gonna try to do that hopefully it works
if<00:06:51.790> not<00:06:52.930> at<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:54.080> end<00:06:54.260> of<00:06:54.410> the<00:06:54.530> day<00:06:54.740> I'll

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
if not at the end of the day I'll

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.520 
if not at the end of the day I'll
probably<00:06:55.910> end<00:06:56.210> up<00:06:56.390> if<00:06:56.570> I<00:06:56.660> like<00:06:56.870> can't<00:06:57.110> figure

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
probably end up if I like can't figure

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.990 
probably end up if I like can't figure
anything<00:06:57.830> out<00:06:58.070> I'll<00:06:58.310> probably<00:06:58.550> just<00:06:58.820> be

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
anything out I'll probably just be

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.670 
anything out I'll probably just be
putting<00:06:59.300> my<00:06:59.420> hair<00:06:59.630> and<00:06:59.840> like<00:07:00.020> five<00:07:00.350> flat

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
putting my hair and like five flat

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.380 
putting my hair and like five flat
twists<00:07:01.130> like<00:07:02.590> all<00:07:03.590> the<00:07:03.680> time<00:07:03.860> but<00:07:04.820> hopefully

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
twists like all the time but hopefully

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.730 
twists like all the time but hopefully
I'll<00:07:05.690> figure<00:07:05.810> it<00:07:05.930> out<00:07:06.110> and<00:07:06.260> I'll<00:07:06.440> get<00:07:06.560> better

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
I'll figure it out and I'll get better

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.250 
I'll figure it out and I'll get better
and<00:07:07.100> better<00:07:07.250> and<00:07:07.460> better<00:07:07.550> at<00:07:07.850> it<00:07:07.880> and<00:07:08.260> more

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
and better and better at it and more

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.020 
and better and better at it and more
most<00:07:09.590> importantly<00:07:10.100> my<00:07:10.310> hair<00:07:10.520> is<00:07:10.610> going<00:07:10.820> to<00:07:10.940> be

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
most importantly my hair is going to be

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.030 
most importantly my hair is going to be
protected<00:07:11.240> and<00:07:12.520> hopefully<00:07:13.520> it<00:07:13.670> will<00:07:13.850> grow
