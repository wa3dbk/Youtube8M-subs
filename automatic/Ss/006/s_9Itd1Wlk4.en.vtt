00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello today we have someone today 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.390
 today is Friday 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 yesterday we are of course late to come here 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.110
 the fifth hour before at the fifth hour we are here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.960
 I came to apologize for that 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:32.960
 The appearance here Tashkent is just real 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 and so here we have glass doors in 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 one of my last videos 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.790
 will start from the code here we did it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.760
 the scavengers left the store guys 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.579
 find 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 we do everything as we did here 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.390
 telescopic through planochki connected 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.770
 in this region they thought how can we fix 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 In the end, well, and on the laser screws 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.759
 mounting the windows which fasten 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.619
 plastic 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.780
 filed immediately pyataks and further fully 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.979
 not singing whether because this set is very 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.990
 liquids are very weak and already where are her 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.120
 pushed pushed and not to his 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.510
 design 53 hidden here show 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.250
 loops here these and came already box 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:34.560
 came with carved by the first thing that scored 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 move the canvas here is crooked i don't 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.150
 I thought that the pancake at the glass doors 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.150
 happens to be a curve 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 cylinder difficult airbag 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:58.850
 excellent we have no thresholds so here 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 she looks at us a little further away 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:11.930
 here everything is the same but the only thing 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.000
 the client chewed but we did what we have 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:24.780
 here in general dobor should have been himself 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.760
 the country but made it a twisted lock 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.760
 here really have not put it yet 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.020
 I'll give you a ride today 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:36.209
 midday home in such here 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:45.050
 cash we have you there, not without 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:52.880
 this loop we have here we recognize 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.880
 all here is this room 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.510
 well, because we were not taken and I 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.450
 recorded and the list did not give with a margin with 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.959
 very good knife should have been a half 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:23.850
 cans i need to stay 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:27.769
 in fact, here it turns out 2 side 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.480
 did put everything right 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:36.870
 put the side there is running out 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:39.180
 wedges then gave and such small 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.920
 exactly pyataks so that you do not give out as 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.920
 he bait very weakly 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.379
 side shelves 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.230
 before it even about a penny you have to 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:58.300
 us and until then casing all 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.180
 we have not gone anywhere at all 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:11.989
 didn't hit 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:14.810
 Skopich sketch is literally now can 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.349
 Only set for this marriage mate 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:24.650
 lath 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:28.120
 and here you look like we 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.120
 can cage world 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:49.610
 it is necessary this passenger is matador 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:53.300
 village show him to be this mount 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:04.760
 In general, all the time all out and 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:08.690
 we still have a bedroom here 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.620
 everything will be valuable here too shorter to us 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.320
 I had to tinker in general there were 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.050
 I had my own difficulties most of all 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:23.780
 tinker like i said here with this 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:28.849
 canvas because they are curves as far as 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:32.000
 maybe we were pulling them out 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.460
 they themselves canvases and boxes pulled 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.660
 pulled out but how much was it 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.030
 perhaps the whole canopy for this 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.620
 ness 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:46.650
 I'm at the door of a complex nothing was too 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.900
 you lean on the canopy first 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.820
 dre and 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:56.220
 measuring how much to the center of the map 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:00.930
 Well, you crash 8 through the template collected 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.210
 primitive pretty pattern 4 we had 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:11.430
 here such confessions of me alone 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:16.410
 a hidden door with hidden hinges that 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:21.800
 we also have strengths like software 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:24.390
 I can quickly show you everything 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.570
 lockers probably hang kitchen 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.570
 headset 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:36.680
 I certainly in furniture to be honest in general 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:41.700
 I do not understand really I do not understand here 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:51.680
 it is clear yes you do not come close here so 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:51.680
 1 year so saved 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.380
 Well, of course something happened here 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.970
 nasty some won't call them 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:13.750
 names randomly on chest ok ok box 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.530
 the door of sico and meats threw on my 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.050
 put out 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:23.320
 nobody sees nothing nobody nothing 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.990
 I hope I find out like this 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:33.040
 great you platband this city cover 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:35.980
 lacquer here i have my disk on suzuki 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.940
 but still Dimov in general, if you had to 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.820
 he was anak it would be better but to 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.110
