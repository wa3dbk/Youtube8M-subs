to<00:00:44.050> have<00:00:44.290> a<00:00:44.559> guest<00:00:44.920> character<00:00:45.520> who<00:00:45.700> was<00:00:45.879> kind

scorpion<00:00:50.950> because<00:00:51.309> he<00:00:51.520> really<00:00:51.850> has<00:00:52.300> powers

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
scorpion because he really has powers

scorpion because he really has powers
that<00:00:52.840> are<00:00:52.870> very<00:00:53.110> unique<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.829> I<00:00:54.370> think<00:00:54.399> is<00:00:54.670> a

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
that are very unique and I think is a

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.670 
that are very unique and I think is a
really<00:00:54.940> good<00:00:55.180> fit<00:00:55.390> in<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.600> DC<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.289> that<00:00:56.469> we

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
really good fit in the DC you in that we

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.979 
really good fit in the DC you in that we
don't<00:00:56.860> have<00:00:57.039> characters<00:00:57.460> like<00:00:58.180> him<00:00:58.480> in<00:00:58.719> our

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
don't have characters like him in our

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.299 
don't have characters like him in our
universe<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.500> mean<00:00:59.620> we<00:00:59.680> have<00:00:59.800> characters<00:01:00.160> that

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
universe I mean we have characters that

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.150 
universe I mean we have characters that
are<00:01:00.489> reborn<00:01:00.940> or<00:01:01.539> from<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.350> nether<00:01:02.590> realm<00:01:02.920> but

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
are reborn or from the nether realm but

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.979 
are reborn or from the nether realm but
they<00:01:03.280> don't<00:01:03.430> have<00:01:03.579> that<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.239> essential<00:01:04.720> part

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
they don't have that the essential part

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.990 
they don't have that the essential part
and<00:01:05.350> that's<00:01:05.650> being<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.130> ninja<00:01:06.340> I<00:01:06.610> think<00:01:06.850> that's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
and that's being a ninja I think that's

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
and that's being a ninja I think that's
the<00:01:07.119> cool<00:01:07.450> combination<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.290> two

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.219 

we<00:01:11.460> certainly<00:01:11.670> thought<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.360> scorpion

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
we certainly thought that scorpion

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.870 
we certainly thought that scorpion
belonged<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> gadget<00:01:14.310> character<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
belonged in the gadget character you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.130 
belonged in the gadget character you
know<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.060> can't<00:01:15.330> lift<00:01:15.510> up<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> car<00:01:15.780> like

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
know he can't lift up a car like

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
know he can't lift up a car like
Superman<00:01:16.620> but<00:01:17.159> he's<00:01:17.370> very<00:01:17.430> agile<00:01:17.850> he's<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
Superman but he's very agile he's a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
Superman but he's very agile he's a
ninja<00:01:18.600> he<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> jump<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.650> place<00:01:19.800> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
ninja he can jump all over the place so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
ninja he can jump all over the place so
that<00:01:20.040> seemed<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> natural<00:01:20.760> thing<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that seemed like a natural thing and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
that seemed like a natural thing and
then<00:01:21.690> we<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.800> dial<00:01:23.400> down<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
then we kind of had to dial down the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.140 
then we kind of had to dial down the
blood<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.570> via<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:25.950> uh<00:01:25.979> once<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.880> did<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
blood so via is so uh once we did that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
blood so via is so uh once we did that
and<00:01:27.630> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> stuff<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and kind of got all that stuff out of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.120 
and kind of got all that stuff out of
the<00:01:29.160> way<00:01:29.190> he<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.270> surprising<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:31.130> natural

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the way he it was surprising how natural

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
the way he it was surprising how natural

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
knew that you would be seeing the design

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
knew that you would be seeing the design
of<00:01:47.729> course<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> adds<00:01:48.750> another<00:01:49.170> level

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of course and so that adds another level

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.249 
of course and so that adds another level
of<00:01:49.890> pressure<00:01:50.190> but<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.729> basically<00:01:51.300> googled

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of pressure but I basically googled

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.320 
of pressure but I basically googled
every<00:01:52.920> version<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> costume<00:01:53.940> not

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
every version of the costume not

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.300 
every version of the costume not
actually<00:01:54.630> googled<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.050> real<00:01:55.289> scorpions<00:01:56.190> I'm

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
actually googled like real scorpions I'm

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.160 
actually googled like real scorpions I'm
sure<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:57.210> designers<00:01:57.660> did<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> same

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
sure that your designers did the same

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
sure that your designers did the same
and<00:01:58.380> try<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.890> other<00:01:59.070> ways<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.729> bring

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and try to think of other ways to bring

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
and try to think of other ways to bring
those<00:02:00.660> visual<00:02:01.080> elements<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.679> design<00:02:02.070> but

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
those visual elements to a design but

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
those visual elements to a design but
still<00:02:02.789> being<00:02:02.940> true<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.450> guys<00:02:03.660> had

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
still being true to what you guys had

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.109 
still being true to what you guys had
done<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.950> envisioned<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:06.060> of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
done so I kind of envisioned a kind of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.930 
done so I kind of envisioned a kind of
scorpion<00:02:06.690> skeletal<00:02:07.590> kind<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> armor<00:02:08.489> overlay

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
scorpion skeletal kind of armor overlay

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.210 
scorpion skeletal kind of armor overlay
I<00:02:09.149> love<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.170> design<00:02:10.500> thank<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> thank<00:02:10.950> you

I love that design thank you thank you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.580 
I love that design thank you thank you
when<00:02:11.519> we<00:02:11.670> saw<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.000> design<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.540> scorpion<00:02:13.140> with

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
when we saw the design of scorpion with

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.949 
when we saw the design of scorpion with
the<00:02:13.739> scorpion<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.280> his<00:02:14.459> chest<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.120> know<00:02:15.269> you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
think of that and then another part was

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.750 
think of that and then another part was
just<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.530> what<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.799> fantastic<00:02:20.040> way

me I just you know growing up with
Batman<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:54.260> think<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.800> would<00:02:54.890> be<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> little

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
Batman it's I think it would be a little

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.700 
Batman it's I think it would be a little
arrogant<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.910> say<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.690> character<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.380> was

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
arrogant to say that a character I was

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.630 
arrogant to say that a character I was
helped<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.190> in<00:02:58.870> creating<00:02:59.870> would<00:03:00.470> beat<00:03:00.740> Batman

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
helped in in creating would beat Batman

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400 
helped in in creating would beat Batman
so<00:03:01.940> I'd<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.480> say<00:03:02.630> Batman<00:03:03.020> if<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.230> had<00:03:03.350> a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
so I'd have to say Batman if I had a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:12.600 
so I'd have to say Batman if I had a
chart<00:03:03.650> for<00:03:04.780> Harvey<00:03:06.220> apparently<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.250> can't

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.670 

Oh
