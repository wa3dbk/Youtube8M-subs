work yeah that was such a great question
there's<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.639> guess<00:04:23.789> there's<00:04:23.970> things<00:04:24.240> in

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
there's and I guess there's things in

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.960 
there's and I guess there's things in
every<00:04:25.110> personality<00:04:25.770> type<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.370> can<00:04:26.460> fuel<00:04:26.789> you

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
every personality type that can fuel you

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.029 
every personality type that can fuel you
right<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:27.660> even<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:28.139> they're<00:04:28.289> not<00:04:28.319> fueling<00:04:28.889> my

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
right so even if they're not fueling my

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.100 
right so even if they're not fueling my
joy<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.340> I'm<00:04:29.550> feeling<00:04:29.940> my<00:04:30.060> own<00:04:30.210> joy<00:04:30.539> that's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
joy and I'm feeling my own joy that's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.100 
joy and I'm feeling my own joy that's
fine<00:04:31.349> so<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.069> don't<00:04:32.430> need<00:04:32.759> to<00:04:33.180> fuel<00:04:33.599> myself

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
fine so I don't need to fuel myself

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.260 
fine so I don't need to fuel myself
