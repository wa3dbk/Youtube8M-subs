 so everything is very fast and for one 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160
 turn 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.379
 is the fact that it influences the generation 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.990
 have a team with a difference because

 is a really weird support 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.010
 You need it for everything like that, but it 's very 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.960
 caring so much involved in caring 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.960
