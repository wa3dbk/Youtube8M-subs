in the middle of fairway and he's
actually<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.260> thinking<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.799> for

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
actually I think thinking of going for

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually I think thinking of going for
the<00:01:05.400> pin<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.000> wide<00:01:06.270> mate<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.780> 86<00:01:07.290> Greg

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the pin and that wide mate in 86 Greg

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.750 
the pin and that wide mate in 86 Greg
Norman<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.310> done<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
Norman has done it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.140 
Norman has done it
that's<00:01:09.000> Bobby<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.939> 17<00:01:11.939> was<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
that's Bobby that was an that 17 was a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's Bobby that was an that 17 was a
bad<00:01:12.450> shot<00:01:12.780> 18<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> nervous<00:01:13.950> shot<00:01:14.250> yeah<00:01:14.640> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
bad shot 18 is a nervous shot yeah but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
bad shot 18 is a nervous shot yeah but
at<00:01:14.939> least<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.900> gives<00:01:15.960> him<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.500> momentum

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
at least that gives him some momentum

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.920 
at least that gives him some momentum
going<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.460> today<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> fact<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> he

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
going into today the fact that he

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539 
going into today the fact that he
salvaged<00:01:19.350> everything<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.400> actually

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
salvaged everything I think actually

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.730 
salvaged everything I think actually
what<00:01:20.850> he<00:01:21.030> went<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.360> last<00:01:21.720> year<00:01:22.049> could<00:01:22.680> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
what he went through last year could be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.999 
what he went through last year could be
a<00:01:23.130> great<00:01:23.790> factor<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.689> how<00:01:24.990> he<00:01:25.049> finishes<00:01:25.470> today

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
a great factor and how he finishes today

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.010 
a great factor and how he finishes today

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
will try to make it into something but I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.240

don't know how successful they will be

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.309 
don't know how successful they will be
and<00:02:20.730> let's<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.209> let<00:02:21.269> them<00:02:21.569> off<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.810> hook<00:02:21.959> with

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
and let's not let them off the hook with

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.949 
and let's not let them off the hook with
this<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.590> mean<00:02:22.769> nobody<00:02:23.280> last<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.790> checked<00:02:23.959> nobody

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
this I mean nobody last I checked nobody

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.660

belligerent<00:02:27.480> contracts<00:02:28.049> and<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.739> just<00:02:29.010> think

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
belligerent contracts and I just think

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.670 
belligerent contracts and I just think
in<00:02:29.280> Josh<00:02:29.459> Hamilton's<00:02:29.940> cases<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:30.629> much<00:02:30.930> as<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
but in this between I do believe this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.589 
but in this between I do believe this
does<00:02:46.950> fall<00:02:47.280> John<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:47.879> think<00:02:48.360> you're<00:02:48.450> right<00:02:48.540> I

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
does fall John I think you're right I

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.360 
does fall John I think you're right I
think<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.019> falls<00:02:49.290> into<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> context<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
think this falls into the context of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.280 
think this falls into the context of
what<00:02:50.430> he's<00:02:50.879> thought<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.599> was<00:02:51.720> any<00:02:51.959> way
