in terms of the rest of the functions

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.160 
in terms of the rest of the functions
and<00:01:27.479> features<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:29.060> lot<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> things<00:01:30.509> remain

the<00:01:31.200> same<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.729> full<00:01:33.890> four

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the same as much as the full four

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
channel mixer the real-life mixer

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.060 
channel mixer the real-life mixer
remains<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> same<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:39.770> mic<00:01:40.770> channels

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
remains the same as the mic channels

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.300 
remains the same as the mic channels
we've<00:01:41.909> done<00:01:42.090> some<00:01:42.240> work<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> mic<00:01:42.840> channels

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
we've done some work on the mic channels

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
we've done some work on the mic channels
now<00:01:44.330> we<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.840> far<00:01:46.200> better<00:01:46.259> match

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
now we think there are far better match

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
now we think there are far better match
for<00:01:46.770> high<00:01:47.190> output<00:01:47.700> microphones<00:01:48.330> one<00:01:48.660> or<00:01:48.750> two

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
for high output microphones one or two

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.410 
for high output microphones one or two
people<00:01:49.140> moaning<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.190> 58<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
people moaning about it some 58 with a

people moaning about it some 58 with a
mic<00:01:51.660> input<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.530> we've<00:01:53.190> really<00:01:53.460> fixed<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
mic input so we've really fixed that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.359 
mic input so we've really fixed that
that<00:01:54.660> issue<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.560> certainly<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.220> at<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that issue and certainly look at the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
that issue and certainly look at the
other<00:01:56.550> features<00:01:56.789> jog<00:01:57.690> wheels<00:01:57.929> are<00:01:58.170> much

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
other features jog wheels are much

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.820 
other features jog wheels are much
improved<00:01:59.570> channel<00:02:00.570> faders<00:02:00.929> as<00:02:01.080> well<00:02:01.320> we've

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
improved channel faders as well we've

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.469 
improved channel faders as well we've
really<00:02:02.100> had<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.310> go<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.940> toughen<00:02:03.300> them

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
really had to go to really toughen them

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.630 
really had to go to really toughen them
up<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:04.710> them<00:02:04.920> super<00:02:05.340> reliable

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
up and really make them super reliable

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.630 
up and really make them super reliable
