00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:24.465
 Embrace the rose, embrace the rose 

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:29.004
 The moment is approaching tonight brutally 

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.426
 embraces the rose, embraces the rose 

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:41.717
 Even now I feel this pain, sweetness ... 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.136
 Oh, my heart 

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:50.998
 Entirely minor 

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:56.663
 his hands stopped 

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:59.643
 in the world 

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:01.984
 Also that day, I wounded, I was wounded 

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.448
 You and I can know the meaning 

00:01:04.448 --> 00:01:07.231
 of this love, which only god knows, a sweet dessert 

00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.007
 Lullaby 

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.551
 Embrace the rose, embrace the rose 

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:17.014
 The moment is approaching tonight brutally 

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:21.504
 Embrace the rose, embrace the rose 

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:27.852
 Before you tear it to pieces ... 

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.650
 Embrace the rose, embrace the rose 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.130
 I loved those who didn't love me 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.130
 I loved those who didn't love me 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Embrace the rose, embrace the rose 

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.500
 But it became real again, 

00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:01.230
 when you turned around 

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.730
 Hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me, 

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:07.100
 Hug me, hug me, hug me, 

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:10.710
 hug me
