00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.860
 on my way 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.720
 do not 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.510
 we are in an online master 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:21.290
 it's been a while since I went up 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.090
 I come to say the why of this and of 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.320
 another series of the miniature if you have 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.860
 seen then you will know that they are 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.240
 spoke to see about this we said masters 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.880
 on-line 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.790
 you know that I have not done 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 nothing I did a streaming about two 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.270
 weeks to the best and above it is not 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 solved the video so wrong because it was 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.580
 already the last thing I had done so I did not 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.650
 he did not see himself and well he came to say no 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.350
 I said in the above but to see I'm not 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.949
 playing absolutely nothing or is not what 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.210
 I open 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.010
 since that streaming the game so I've 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.390
 decided since I have so many things 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.430
 open so many sets 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.800
 apart from that I do not play anymore I'm going to finish 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.870
 with this series at least for now 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.300
 I know when maybe I'll return some 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.190
 time when I vote to play to get 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.080
 play if I play I assure you that he recorded it 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.290
 but really now I do not feel like anything 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.290
 to play 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.990
 because I do not want to do something that not 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.730
 I really do not want to do that because 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.680
 either by visits or by which I prefer 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.920
 do something that I like and have visits 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.620
 I'm not going to have a bad time I do not know 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.990
 I do this for fun 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.229
 so 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.580
 That's why I'm not playing anything feel to 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.880
 those who like the series really do not 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.430
 I do not want to bother anyone or that is what 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.990
 I really want to do, I do not want to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 I'm playing the game I say 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.650
 totally true, that is, I do not record 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.470
 because I do not feel like it because I do not 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.780
 I play directly then well 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 I hope you do not mind that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.610
 you understand apart this game is a rpg 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.260
 it has no end it's all the time killing 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.560
 kill kill level up kill kill 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.570
 kill level up then well that 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.570
 does not have a story to follow 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.360
 then do what it would be to follow 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.370
 playing would be the same 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.460
 good but with different advice what 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.500
 I understand or I understand it because I 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.900
 before I wanted to play and I played 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.700
 and I recorded it but really not now 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.770
 game so I hope you understand 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.970
 I'm sorry and well we're going with the other 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.550
 game now we go back 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.819
 well here we are again the other 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.640
 game is exposed 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.400
 you know for those who have seen the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.790
 series during the time the truth is that 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.700
 it was this series has had a few peaks 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.280
 very very strange because I did the first 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.400
 second and third chapters or first and 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.910
 second I do not remember and I decided not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.020
 upload it because 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.180
 to almost nobody 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.720
 I liked it enough was not what 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.630
 normal or it was something very low and then 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.430
 during the time you told me coming 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.290
 people of is poor we want is because no 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.540
 is poor we want is poor and returned 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.990
 returned is poor until chapter 14 that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.090
 it was the last east as if it would be 15 and 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.950
 get to the space zone that would be already 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.080
 the expansion or the game is over 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.069
 in the expansion because it would be the area 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.060
 space 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.060
 so 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.660
 I realized that I do not keep anything 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.040
 of the space zone 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.340
 this woman is a whole stadium the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.290
 civilization was not saved 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.599
 the truth is that the space zone does not 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.790
 liked nothing nothing the truth is that 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.120
 when what you have seen will be noticed 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.950
 something that was there proving it was 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.220
 the first moments or I was recording 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.110
 followed and I was not liking the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.650
 space zone and that's why I decided not to 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:12.560
 follow with the series are 14 episodes with 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:15.780
 this in quotation marks 15 as the end of 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.940
 series since this series had open and 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.690
 It had not been going up for a long time 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.460
 practically not the truth is that I do not 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.190
 really, this is the same as 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.910
 with said we just told you no 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.340
 I want to not play me space area 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.670
 it seemed very boring I'm sorry for the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.510
 You like it but I did not like it or it's me 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.140
 I have the original game 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.850
 box with expansion and others but I do not 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.960
 he liked that he had never come to the 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.600
 space I did not like 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.330
 since the space did not seem very 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.980
 slow bored the best later 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.530
 it improved like that but not 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.990
 I did not like not force 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.730
 will to play reluctantly 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.140
 or to play unwillingly I do not play or be 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.910
 the times that I have to play I like 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.210
 play something that amuses me 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.470
 have fun record it either minecraft reus 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.650
 although you do not like many but the 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.540
 truth this series I upload because because 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.450
 I like it or in general reus is a 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.620
 game that I loved that is the chapters 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.910
 that you have seen and I still have 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.060
 a few I recorded all followed in 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.000
 one afternoon because I was not flawed 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.700
 be late one afternoon at night was 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.930
 flawed the truth and I started to play 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.200
 I did little people little game that I did not 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:39.410
 that happened and well I do not want that either 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.200
 give him the sheet I like to do some 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.390
 video talking like that in general without doing 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.880
 nothing practically speaking I could put 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.150
 my camera but I feel more uncomfortable 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.160
 talking to the camera focusing 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.080
 so I like to do them that's how 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.580
 it's a more personal deal with you 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.409
 from you to me and from me to you something 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.950
 that by being able to communicate you can put 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:08.070
 the comments whatever you want 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.360
 except to disrespect me I 'm missing 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.040
 respect if you do not do it 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.040
 logically still not even that sometimes 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.879
 well sometimes I do not even insult so much 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.270
 people be two comments nor one 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.849
 insult to block and ready either 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.219
 I want people who bother but really 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:30.240
 that has not bothered you 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:32.630
 finish these two series is by e 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.069
 It bothers me a little more because 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.020
 it would end the game was left a 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.569
 stadium and what happens that a stadium 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.280
 long noses already for being the last and 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.560
 digimon curb with axis I'm not 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.950
 playing so I do not want to bother anymore 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.590
 so I hope you understand 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.820
 what I want to say so we see each other in 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.820
 the next video is next
