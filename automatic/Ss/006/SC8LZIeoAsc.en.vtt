Winnie<00:00:16.980> tempo<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:20.390> fortunate<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.980> think<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> be

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
Winnie tempo and fortunate I think to be

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.359 
Winnie tempo and fortunate I think to be
one<00:00:23.460> little<00:00:23.640> game<00:00:24.380> yeah<00:00:25.970> second<00:00:26.970> our<00:00:28.369> thought

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
one little game yeah second our thought

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
one little game yeah second our thought
we<00:00:29.490> had<00:00:29.720> yeah<00:00:30.720> equal<00:00:31.109> share<00:00:31.399> better<00:00:32.399> chances

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we had yeah equal share better chances

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
we had yeah equal share better chances
keep<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.480> made<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.870> two<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.500> very<00:00:34.590> good

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
keep was made I think two very very good

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
keep was made I think two very very good
saves<00:00:36.800> but<00:00:37.850> overall<00:00:39.800> for<00:00:40.800> 90<00:00:41.160> minutes<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.940> not

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
saves but overall for 90 minutes not not

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
saves but overall for 90 minutes not not
a<00:00:42.870> performance<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.710> think<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:44.360> was<00:00:46.489> good

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
a performance I think that was good

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
a performance I think that was good
enough<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> win<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> game<00:00:49.730> site<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.260> too<00:00:52.260> slow

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
enough to win the game site to too slow

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.459 
enough to win the game site to too slow
in<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.890> half<00:00:53.180> whole<00:00:54.180> situation<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.260> too

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in first half whole situation was too

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.010 
in first half whole situation was too
slow<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.890> first<00:00:56.190> half<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.780> never

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
slow in the first half so we never

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.400 
slow in the first half so we never
really<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.520> position<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.420> mount

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
really got into a position to mount

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.700 
really got into a position to mount
attacks<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.780> can't<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.960> lost<00:01:04.290> count<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
attacks because I can't a lost count of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
attacks because I can't a lost count of
the<00:01:04.769> amount<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.430> we've<00:01:05.610> got<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the amount of time we've got the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940 
the amount of time we've got the
clearance<00:01:06.330> between<00:01:06.869> shut<00:01:07.229> down<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
clearance between shut down with just

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.179 
clearance between shut down with just
too<00:01:08.100> slow<00:01:08.479> second<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> much<00:01:09.869> better<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
too slow second of much better but you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.350 
too slow second of much better but you
know<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> can't<00:01:11.430> play<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> won

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
defense yeah have disappointed was it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.819 
defense yeah have disappointed was it
when<00:01:42.299> you're<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.020> normal<00:01:43.079> back<00:01:43.560> for

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
when you're back to your normal back for

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319 
when you're back to your normal back for
that<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.340> seem<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.909> many<00:01:45.119> chances

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that there seem to be so many chances

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.120 
that there seem to be so many chances
for<00:01:45.540> burying<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.170> start<00:01:46.590> yeah<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.890> i<00:01:46.920> think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
for burying a start yeah and i think

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
for burying a start yeah and i think
that<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> back<00:01:47.670> form<00:01:47.970> i<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that was from the back form i think that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
that was from the back form i think that
would<00:01:48.990> smell<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:49.380> did<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> picture<00:01:50.250> i<00:01:50.280> think

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
would smell very did a picture i think

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.120 
would smell very did a picture i think
they're<00:01:50.579> too<00:01:50.759> many<00:01:50.939> runs<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.009> got

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
they're too many runs I think they got

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.499 
they're too many runs I think they got
too<00:01:53.310> many<00:01:53.399> crosses<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> first<00:01:54.990> half<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
too many crosses in the first half and

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
too many crosses in the first half and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
yet in the second half without sort of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
yet in the second half without sort of
doing<00:01:59.939> too<00:02:00.329> much<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.189> end<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.829> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
get too many crosses in respect a lot of

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.449 
get too many crosses in respect a lot of
their<00:02:08.550> crosses<00:02:09.770> we've<00:02:10.770> picked<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> more

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
their crosses we've picked that more

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.339 
their crosses we've picked that more
second<00:02:11.910> balls<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.510> picked<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
second balls and we picked up in the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.020 
second balls and we picked up in the
first<00:02:13.620> half<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.660> was<00:02:15.870> able<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.610> man<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
first half and we was able to man you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
first half and we was able to man you
know<00:02:18.180> reasonable<00:02:18.810> attacks<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.709> as<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.010> say<00:02:20.190> on

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
know reasonable attacks and as I say on

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.100 
know reasonable attacks and as I say on
I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> calc<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.540> was<00:02:21.629> made<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> couple

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
I think the calc it was made a couple

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.619 
I think the calc it was made a couple
but<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.860> actual<00:02:23.129> fact<00:02:23.190> all<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.150> has<00:02:24.239> deserved

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
but in actual fact all that has deserved

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.660 
but in actual fact all that has deserved
it<00:02:24.840> he<00:02:24.930> made<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> miraculous<00:02:25.650> saving<00:02:26.160> first<00:02:26.430> off

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it he made a miraculous saving first off

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.510 
it he made a miraculous saving first off
without<00:02:27.540> has<00:02:27.840> deserve<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> second<00:02:29.160> half<00:02:29.280> has

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
without has deserve a second half has

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.309 
without has deserve a second half has
made<00:02:29.730> nothing<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.530> outstanding<00:02:32.190> saves

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
made nothing to like outstanding saves

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.009 
made nothing to like outstanding saves
when<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.470> possibly<00:02:34.950> deserve<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.720> goal

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
when we possibly deserve to get a goal

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.449 
when we possibly deserve to get a goal
for<00:02:37.230> our<00:02:37.319> efforts<00:02:37.709> that<00:02:37.920> doesn't<00:02:38.250> make<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
for our efforts that doesn't make the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.309 
for our efforts that doesn't make the
say<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.819> we've<00:02:39.000> been<00:02:39.180> preserved<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.200> we

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
say that we've been preserved to that we

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.820 
say that we've been preserved to that we
deserve<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> win<00:02:41.069> some<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.360> did<00:02:42.830> so

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
deserve to win some I think we did so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.670 
deserve to win some I think we did so
but<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.700> say<00:02:44.879> EEE<00:02:45.510> made<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> think

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
but as I say EEE made to I think

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.009 
but as I say EEE made to I think
terrific<00:02:47.310> saves<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.030> again<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.840> made

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
terrific saves in this again you made

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.460 
terrific saves in this again you made
two<00:02:49.230> changes<00:02:49.260> at<00:02:49.830> halftime<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.879> as<00:02:51.060> much

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
two changes at halftime was that as much

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.390 
two changes at halftime was that as much
reflection<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.769> two<00:02:52.920> players<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.250> were

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
reflection on the two players that were

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.350 
reflection on the two players that were
subs<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.730> no<00:02:53.910> no<00:02:54.300> no<00:02:54.690> no<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.019> thought<00:02:55.379> just<00:02:56.360> we

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
subs you no no no no I thought just we

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.030 
subs you no no no no I thought just we
tried<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:59.640> gas<00:02:59.909> behind<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.690> tomb<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.379> we<00:03:01.890> did

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
tried to get gas behind a tomb as we did

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.420 
tried to get gas behind a tomb as we did
on<00:03:02.129> Saturday<00:03:02.700> because<00:03:03.209> it<00:03:03.390> worked<00:03:03.599> quite<00:03:03.900> well

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
on Saturday because it worked quite well

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.309 
on Saturday because it worked quite well
it<00:03:05.430> didn't<00:03:05.640> work<00:03:05.790> quite<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.060> well<00:03:06.180> today<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:06.989> we

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
it didn't work quite as well today so we

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.850 
it didn't work quite as well today so we
went<00:03:07.470> back<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.739> our<00:03:07.950> normal<00:03:09.170> 4331<00:03:10.170> off<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
went back to our normal 4331 off the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.259 
went back to our normal 4331 off the
front<00:03:11.040> man<00:03:11.280> which<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.580> probably<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.909> system

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
front man which is probably the system

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.420 
front man which is probably the system
so<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:12.750> best<00:03:12.989> but<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.950> worked<00:03:14.220> for<00:03:14.370> us

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so it's is best but that worked for us

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.009 
so it's is best but that worked for us
for<00:03:14.519> well<00:03:14.849> on<00:03:14.970> Saturday<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.569> second<00:03:15.930> half

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
for well on Saturday in the second half

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.770 
for well on Saturday in the second half
so<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.290> went<00:03:16.409> for<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.150> whether<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.330> made<00:03:18.569> any

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
so we went for it whether that made any

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.229 
so we went for it whether that made any
difference<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.860> how<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.310> played<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> first

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
difference to how we played in the first

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.690 
difference to how we played in the first
off<00:03:22.040> now

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
off now

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.479 
off now
I<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.480> think<00:03:24.569> so<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.890> know<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.340> we

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I don't think so because you know so we

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.610 
I don't think so because you know so we
play<00:03:26.670> with<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:26.970> comfortable<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:28.200> Saturday

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
play with it comfortable on Saturday

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.229 
play with it comfortable on Saturday
second<00:03:29.610> half<00:03:29.819> know<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:31.170> basic<00:03:31.620> system<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
second half know the basic system the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.900 
second half know the basic system the
423<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:34.140> that<00:03:34.739> was<00:03:34.950> better<00:03:35.310> for<00:03:35.640> offenders

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
423 one that was better for offenders

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.729 
423 one that was better for offenders
and<00:03:36.540> there's<00:03:36.780> certainly<00:03:36.989> better<00:03:37.170> attacking

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
and there's certainly better attacking

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
and there's certainly better attacking
threat<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.220> second<00:03:38.580> period<00:03:38.700> Ludwig

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
threat in the second period Ludwig

and<00:05:06.780> that's<00:05:07.020> not<00:05:07.169> their<00:05:07.380> fault<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.710> might<00:05:08.010> be

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
and that's not their fault that might be

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.950 
and that's not their fault that might be
my<00:05:08.310> fault<00:05:08.340> but<00:05:08.820> we're<00:05:09.450> actually<00:05:09.539> bringing

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
my fault but we're actually bringing

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
know I look at that and think to myself

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.260 
know I look at that and think to myself
there<00:05:16.169> the<00:05:17.130> soon<00:05:17.370> they<00:05:17.550> get<00:05:17.789> back<00:05:18.000> playing

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
there the soon they get back playing

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.870 
there the soon they get back playing
assume<00:05:18.780> they<00:05:18.960> get<00:05:19.169> back<00:05:19.410> into<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.669> right

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
assume they get back into the the right

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.900 
assume they get back into the the right
vein<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.180> form<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.380> sooner<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.830> we<00:05:23.130> get

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
vein of form and the sooner that we get

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.879 
vein of form and the sooner that we get
back<00:05:24.150> on<00:05:24.330> it<00:05:24.479> but<00:05:24.690> maybe<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.530> two<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.740> them

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
back on it but maybe the two of them

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.860 
back on it but maybe the two of them
together<00:05:26.010> again<00:05:26.820> perhaps<00:05:27.210> wasn't<00:05:27.539> quite

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
together again perhaps wasn't quite

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.330 
together again perhaps wasn't quite
right<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.860> do<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.220> look<00:05:30.120> at<00:05:30.270> that<00:05:30.360> myself<00:05:30.690> and

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
right to do I look at that myself and

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.040 
right to do I look at that myself and
decide<00:05:32.340> if<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.550> was<00:05:32.700> like<00:05:32.849> to<00:05:33.000> do<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.210> on<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.960> we

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
decide if I was like to do it on and we

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.210 
decide if I was like to do it on and we
don't<00:05:34.200> seem<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.409> better<00:05:34.650> pass<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.039> game

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
don't seem to better pass the game

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.370 
don't seem to better pass the game
without<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.580> penalty<00:05:35.909> control<00:05:36.479> of<00:05:36.630> controversy

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380

without a penalty control of controversy
first<00:05:38.099> half<00:05:38.340> Elliot<00:05:38.760> Lee<00:05:38.880> went<00:05:39.090> down<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.419> seem

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
first half Elliot Lee went down you seem

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.290 
first half Elliot Lee went down you seem
to<00:05:39.750> appear<00:05:40.020> limit<00:05:40.440> sideline<00:05:40.919> well<00:05:41.099> we<00:05:41.580> thought

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
to appear limit sideline well we thought

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.070 
to appear limit sideline well we thought
we<00:05:42.450> was<00:05:43.820> for<00:05:44.820> fourth<00:05:45.120> official<00:05:45.390> for<00:05:45.750> it<00:05:45.930> was

we was for fourth official for it was

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.409 
we was for fourth official for it was

about<00:05:48.720> size<00:05:48.930> today<00:05:49.349> I<00:05:49.590> think<00:05:50.220> one<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.880> most

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090
