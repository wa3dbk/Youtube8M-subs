 all the crap I've been sailing on the lake wants to support the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.460
 vision they assume 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.720

 we have to leave but we are completely independent of Quebec is 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.329
 much better understanding between 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.379
 this plan contains a larger analysis leading provider of 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.079
 110 journalists in three parts 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.099
 what confirms the break 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.239
 this enthusiastic conduct 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.269

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.849
 how would you react 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.039
 several weapons secretly registered 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.009
 it is the ruin of hasty conclusions 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.299
 more than a year ago 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.299
 this seventh place win 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.449
 it's innovative 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.459
 today it's the club 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.459

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:27.429
 this victory is in the article 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.049
 only the creator of the body 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.339
 in an open letter to the press 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.339
 it's a complicated hen 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.789
 a girl from the group 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:09.839
 and even if they tried to kill me but in the current crisis 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.839
 clermont punished 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.490
 initially I wanted to prove the opposite 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.879
 purchase intentions 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.409
 so how do 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.930
 war etc

 m in 2008 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.990
 what an insult to casablanca the English team chopped the game 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.610
 that makes sense the rise of the eve of the sheep post 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.069
 but I think it can say so
