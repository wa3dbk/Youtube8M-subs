got<00:00:06.520> a<00:00:06.550> Waystation<00:00:07.029> coming<00:00:07.510> up<00:00:07.600> here<00:00:07.870> we're

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
got a Waystation coming up here we're

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.249 
got a Waystation coming up here we're
still<00:00:08.710> yeah<00:00:09.580> we're<00:00:09.760> in<00:00:09.820> Virginia<00:00:10.049> if<00:00:11.049> you<00:00:11.170> go

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259 
still yeah we're in Virginia if you go

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.350 
still yeah we're in Virginia if you go
to<00:00:11.320> weigh<00:00:11.530> station<00:00:12.099> about<00:00:12.339> a<00:00:12.400> mile<00:00:12.790> and<00:00:13.000> a<00:00:13.089> half

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
to weigh station about a mile and a half

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.130 
to weigh station about a mile and a half
away<00:00:13.769> let's<00:00:14.769> run<00:00:14.919> it<00:00:15.219> right<00:00:15.339> now<00:00:15.580> a<00:00:17.820> free<00:00:18.820> pass

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
away let's run it right now a free pass

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.630 
away let's run it right now a free pass
area<00:00:20.140> basically<00:00:21.070> is<00:00:21.250> two<00:00:21.490> sensors

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
area basically is two sensors

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.120 
area basically is two sensors
one<00:00:22.970> registers<00:00:23.510> you<00:00:23.780> and<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.800> other<00:00:24.950> one

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
one registers you and the other one

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.770 
one registers you and the other one
registers<00:00:25.550> game<00:00:26.300> hits<00:00:26.690> you<00:00:26.900> can<00:00:27.110> pass<00:00:27.560> or<00:00:27.950> stop

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
registers game hits you can pass or stop

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.840 
registers game hits you can pass or stop
this<00:00:30.590> first<00:00:30.860> poll<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:31.370> you're<00:00:31.520> about<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.730> see

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
this first poll that you're about to see

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.360 
this first poll that you're about to see
you<00:00:32.300> care

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
you care

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.920 
you care
we'll<00:00:33.670> be<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.000> one<00:00:34.150> that<00:00:34.240> weighs<00:00:34.450> me<00:00:34.750> and

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
we'll be the one that weighs me and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.500 
we'll be the one that weighs me and
registers<00:00:35.350> my<00:00:35.590> tag

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
registers my tag

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.270 
registers my tag
now<00:00:37.630> tell<00:00:38.170> me<00:00:38.200> if<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:38.620> need<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.920> stop

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
now tell me if I need to stop

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.370 
now tell me if I need to stop
or<00:00:40.370> like<00:00:40.820> right<00:00:40.850> now<00:00:41.300> I<00:00:41.630> can<00:00:41.930> see

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
or like right now I can see

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.570 
or like right now I can see
getting<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> all

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
getting it all

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.520 
getting it all
so<00:00:45.850> we'll<00:00:46.000> see<00:00:46.180> if<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.360> lets<00:00:46.540> me<00:00:46.690> go<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:49.890> second

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.350 

here<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.190> century

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.869 

no<00:00:58.810> sensor<00:00:59.290> needs<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.430> go<00:01:00.580> in

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.649 

rape<00:01:04.479> speed<00:01:04.839> limit<00:01:05.140> is<00:01:05.260> 40<00:01:05.650> mop<00:01:06.150> 55<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:07.479> I<00:01:07.509> gotta

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
rape speed limit is 40 mop 55 so I gotta

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
rape speed limit is 40 mop 55 so I gotta
start<00:01:07.869> bringing<00:01:08.229> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.080 

ship

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.669 

it<00:01:15.600> must<00:01:16.250> require<00:01:17.250> speed<00:01:17.820> limit<00:01:18.179> it's<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.049> 40

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
it must require speed limit it's now 40

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.250 
it must require speed limit it's now 40
I'm<00:01:20.429> 30<00:01:20.850> now

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
I'm 30 now

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.000 
I'm 30 now

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
they may want to scale you me so we'll

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.600 
they may want to scale you me so we'll
see<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.160> in<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.400> second<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:44.010> have<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.130> go<00:01:45.250> scale

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
see you in a second I have to go scale

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.690 
see you in a second I have to go scale
so<00:01:46.030> let's<00:01:46.240> go<00:01:46.390> skip<00:01:46.740> now<00:01:47.740> my<00:01:47.980> weights<00:01:48.280> are<00:01:48.460> fine

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
so let's go skip now my weights are fine

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.890 
so let's go skip now my weights are fine
I'm<00:01:49.030> worried<00:01:49.300> about<00:01:49.330> that
