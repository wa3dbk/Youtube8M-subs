00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.120
 6 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.400
 we 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.630
 it is everyone knows I quickly was 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.220
 so today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.010
 unpacking assassin's creed iii 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.760
 liberation so I received by amazon 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:08.380
 so I pre-order and so that's 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.540
 gone so that should so I really 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.100
 I'm impatient I think I'm waiting for him 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 a lot I expect a lot of games 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.560
 assassin's creed iii release to the 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:27.580
 box and well done really great from 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.710
 the soft flow loss but the freedom to 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.670
 wear no when we went really well 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:42.490
 done since a little pop card very 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:46.330
 important and an amazon paper that's me 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:02:06.899
 therefore concerns the plastic 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:02:15.130
 assassin's creed so the little jacket 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:18.400
 the little jacques is small and and the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.870
 little dre my little booklet but withdrawn 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.940

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.319
 People no books 1 but here we 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:31.390

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:32.590
 arm and a paper that's one it was 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.060
