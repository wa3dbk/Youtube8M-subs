like these pins I got these at Cydia and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.590 
like these pins I got these at Cydia and
somehow<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> feel<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.640> quality<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.210> said<00:00:24.420> he<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

a<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.500> better<00:00:25.650> than<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> ones<00:00:26.130> at

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
Daiso but it could just depend on the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.939
