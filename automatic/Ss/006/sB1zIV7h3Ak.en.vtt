has<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.920> fair<00:01:00.430> amount<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.699> lead<00:01:00.940> in<00:01:00.969> it<00:01:01.210> because

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
has a fair amount of lead in it because

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.289 
has a fair amount of lead in it because
once<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.500> compare<00:01:02.980> these<00:01:03.129> two<00:01:03.190> nuts<00:01:03.640> it's<00:01:04.149> a

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
once you compare these two nuts it's a

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.940 
once you compare these two nuts it's a
pretty<00:01:04.510> hefty<00:01:04.720> piece<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.670> anyway<00:01:07.680> moving<00:01:08.680> on

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
pretty hefty piece but anyway moving on

I<00:01:09.189> have<00:01:09.340> run<00:01:09.580> these<00:01:09.729> some<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.659> just<00:01:10.689> about

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
I have run these some and just about

I have run these some and just about
half<00:01:11.920> them<00:01:12.130> into<00:01:12.490> a<00:01:12.520> tuned<00:01:13.240> state<00:01:13.570> and

half them into a tuned state and

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.740 
half them into a tuned state and

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.660 
for this style I probably wouldn't go
less<00:02:49.300> than<00:02:49.330> that

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.790 

I<00:02:54.700> missed<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.630> was<00:02:55.900> looking<00:02:56.319> at<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> tach

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
I missed that I was looking at the tach

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.250 
I missed that I was looking at the tach
was<00:02:57.580> at<00:02:57.760> four-and-a-half<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.420> can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.020 

that's<00:03:01.800> actually<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> bad<00:03:02.520> given<00:03:02.849> here

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that's actually not a bad given here

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
that's actually not a bad given here
this<00:03:03.629> is<00:03:03.810> probably<00:03:04.379> an<00:03:04.500> idol<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.830> wear<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.160> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
this is probably an idol to wear if it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.759 
this is probably an idol to wear if it
were<00:03:05.370> in<00:03:05.489> your<00:03:05.519> engine<00:03:05.970> you're<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> generator

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
were in your engine you're a generator

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.670 
were in your engine you're a generator
life<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.280> on

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.070 

but<00:03:12.310> in<00:03:12.519> terms<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.939> smoothness<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.629> not<00:03:13.810> that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:33.260 

rookies<00:03:16.740> back<00:03:16.950> up<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> five

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.309 

this<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.720> not<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.050> macro<00:03:34.500> isn't

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
this is not on macro isn't

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:53.410 
this is not on macro isn't
not<00:03:36.890> on<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.159> flower<00:03:37.400> right<00:03:37.730> now<00:03:37.909> okay

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.880 

takes<00:03:53.990> over<00:03:54.110> pretty<00:03:54.440> nicely<00:03:54.650> doesn't<00:03:54.980> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:07.190 

load<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.490> up

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.690 

ultimately<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:07.890> would<00:04:08.099> say<00:04:08.250> if<00:04:08.459> you're

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
ultimately I would say if you're

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.070 
ultimately I would say if you're
experiencing<00:04:09.209> something<00:04:09.450> like<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:10.020> is

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
experiencing something like that this is

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.690 
experiencing something like that this is
too<00:04:10.410> deep

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
too deep

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.850 
too deep
that's<00:04:12.090> what<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.330> factory<00:04:12.629> called<00:04:12.840> for<00:04:13.140> but

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
that's what the factory called for but

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.220 
that's what the factory called for but
if<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.129> need<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.310> do<00:04:14.810> increase<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.959> amount<00:04:16.169> of

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
if we need to do increase the amount of

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.129 
if we need to do increase the amount of
fuel<00:04:17.180> that's<00:04:18.180> something<00:04:18.510> we<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.780> do<00:04:18.900> these

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
fuel that's something we can do these

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.520 
fuel that's something we can do these
are<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.380> Riedel<00:04:19.650> Jets<00:04:19.859> right<00:04:20.070> here

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
of course on the secondary side they're

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.300 
of course on the secondary side they're
not<00:04:24.240> functioning

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
not functioning

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.570 
not functioning
they<00:04:25.760> shouldn't<00:04:26.030> be<00:04:26.090> should<00:04:26.600> be<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.720> dead<00:04:26.930> sir

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.050 

well<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.120> also<00:04:33.300> not<00:04:33.570> under<00:04:33.870> load<00:04:34.050> -<00:04:35.060> that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
well it's also not under load - that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:05:37.920 
well it's also not under load - that
should<00:04:36.210> make<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.390> difference

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120

Oh<00:05:56.150> Topsy<00:05:56.780> bad

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.700 

I<00:06:00.520> would<00:06:01.520> say<00:06:01.729> on<00:06:02.060> these<00:06:02.330> even<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.440> with<00:06:03.620> the

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
I would say on these even so with the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.409 
I would say on these even so with the
die<00:06:03.889> cast<00:06:04.220> particular<00:06:05.030> could<00:06:05.150> do<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.240> lot<00:06:05.360> of

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
die cast particular could do a lot of

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.140 
die cast particular could do a lot of
driving<00:06:06.129> always<00:06:07.129> check<00:06:07.370> your<00:06:07.400> fittings<00:06:07.879> I

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
driving always check your fittings I

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.909 
driving always check your fittings I
don't<00:06:08.720> know<00:06:08.810> if<00:06:08.900> we<00:06:08.990> need<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.139> go<00:06:09.289> back<00:06:09.440> over<00:06:09.620> in

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
don't know if we need to go back over in

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.629 
don't know if we need to go back over in
terms<00:06:10.129> of<00:06:10.340> mounting<00:06:10.930> using<00:06:11.930> the<00:06:12.020> X<00:06:12.169> pattern

terms of mounting using the X pattern

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.820 
terms of mounting using the X pattern
that's<00:06:13.639> always<00:06:13.849> important<00:06:14.530> haven't<00:06:15.530> seen<00:06:15.680> any

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
that's always important haven't seen any

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.080 
that's always important haven't seen any
of<00:06:15.860> these<00:06:15.949> that<00:06:16.159> have<00:06:16.280> cracked<00:06:16.550> but<00:06:16.819> of<00:06:16.909> course

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
of these that have cracked but of course

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.210 
of these that have cracked but of course
we<00:06:17.539> haven't<00:06:17.720> seen<00:06:17.960> but<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.139> handful<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.680> them<00:06:18.800> so

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
we haven't seen but a handful of them so

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.980 
we haven't seen but a handful of them so
well<00:06:19.940> all<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.210> mounting<00:06:20.509> and<00:06:20.569> all<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:20.810> stuff

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
well all the mounting and all that stuff

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.080 
well all the mounting and all that stuff
is<00:06:21.110> on<00:06:21.229> my<00:06:21.379> other<00:06:21.500> videos<00:06:21.949> that<00:06:22.699> we've<00:06:22.849> sent

the<00:06:23.240> ly<00:06:23.419> so<00:06:23.720> I<00:06:23.930> think<00:06:24.110> you<00:06:24.349> could<00:06:24.590> anyway
