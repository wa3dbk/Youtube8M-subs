mounting hole to the camera from and we

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.910 
mounting hole to the camera from and we
can<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:16.030> can<00:01:16.299> see<00:01:16.479> them<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:16.780> I'm<00:01:17.320> going<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.649> grab

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
again finger ties I'm just gonna put

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.330 
again finger ties I'm just gonna put
four<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.800> put<00:01:47.070> four<00:01:47.310> or

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
four of them on you can put four or

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.970 
four of them on you can put four or
eight<00:01:47.810> it<00:01:48.810> doesn't<00:01:49.290> really<00:01:49.410> need<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.860> than

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
eight it doesn't really need more than

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.400 
eight it doesn't really need more than
four<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.060> some<00:01:51.540> people<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
four but some people like it really

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.390 
four but some people like it really
secure<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.280> would<00:01:53.430> put<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:54.300> eight<00:01:54.360> balls

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
secure so they would put all eight balls

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.580 
secure so they would put all eight balls
so<00:01:56.400> now<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.480> locating<00:01:58.410> pin

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so now as you can see the locating pin

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.850 
so now as you can see the locating pin
on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.830> mound<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.370> about<00:01:59.850> four<00:02:00.270> thirty

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
on the mound is about four thirty

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
on the mound is about four thirty
position<00:02:01.860> four<00:02:02.490> thirty<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.910> clock<00:02:03.000> as

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
position four thirty on the clock as

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.110 
position four thirty on the clock as
you're<00:02:03.600> looking<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> clock<00:02:04.230> face<00:02:05.120> which

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
you're looking at the clock face which

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.660 
you're looking at the clock face which
means<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.810> our<00:02:06.840> index<00:02:07.500> ring<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.250> lens<00:02:08.460> is

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
means that our index ring on the lens is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
means that our index ring on the lens is
gonna<00:02:08.880> come<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.020> 1:30<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
gonna come out at about 1:30 at the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.860 
gonna come out at about 1:30 at the
operator<00:02:11.430> side<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.180> good<00:02:12.420> place<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
operator side which is a good place to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.770 
operator side which is a good place to
be<00:02:13.640> seen<00:02:14.640> by<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:16.880> by<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.940> operator<00:02:18.450> when<00:02:18.660> they

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
be seen by the by the operator when they

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380 
be seen by the by the operator when they
pulling<00:02:19.350> focus<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:20.400> I'm<00:02:20.550> gonna<00:02:20.730> take<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> Toki

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
pulling focus but I'm gonna take a Toki

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.460 
pulling focus but I'm gonna take a Toki
911<00:02:21.900> 216<00:02:22.530> do<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.910> look<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.480> index

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
911 216 do that we look at the index

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
911 216 do that we look at the index
ring<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.950> lens<00:02:26.130> which<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:27.090> here<00:02:27.120> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
ring on the lens which is right here and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.200 
ring on the lens which is right here and
we<00:02:27.900> line<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.070> orange<00:02:29.430> dot<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
we line it up with the orange dot on the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.410 
we line it up with the orange dot on the
mound<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.250> then<00:02:32.250> before<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:33.060> do<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.210> we're

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
mound and then before we do that we're

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.620 
mound and then before we do that we're
going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> make<00:02:33.780> sure<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.320> both<00:02:35.210> locking<00:02:36.210> tab

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
going to make sure that both locking tab

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.190 
going to make sure that both locking tab
and<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.770> iris<00:02:38.190> ring<00:02:38.460> are<00:02:38.970> turned<00:02:39.420> all<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.050> way

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
and the iris ring are turned all the way

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.230 
and the iris ring are turned all the way
back<00:02:41.270> counterclockwise<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:44.100> now<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.700> lined

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
back counterclockwise so now I I lined

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.170 
back counterclockwise so now I I lined
up<00:02:45.420> roughly<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.860> lens<00:02:47.070> goes<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.790> I'm

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
up roughly the lens goes in and I'm

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.920 
up roughly the lens goes in and I'm
turning<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.690> counterclockwise<00:02:49.100> until<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.459> feel

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
turning it counterclockwise until I feel

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.710 
turning it counterclockwise until I feel
the<00:02:51.930> pin<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:53.280> locating<00:02:53.820> pins<00:02:54.030> snap<00:02:54.300> into<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the pin the locating pins snap into the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
the pin the locating pins snap into the
slot<00:02:54.959> in<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> lens<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:56.070> means<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
slot in the lens that means that the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.300 
slot in the lens that means that the
lens<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.150> mounted<00:02:58.050> properly<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.980> located

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.360 
the lens is locked as you can see it's
solid<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.900> mouth<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.590> iris

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
solid and now the this mouth has a iris

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.449 
solid and now the this mouth has a iris
control<00:03:23.580> feature<00:03:23.940> built<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:26.280> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
control feature built in and on the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.100 
control feature built in and on the
floating<00:03:26.730> ring<00:03:27.060> I'm<00:03:28.050> just<00:03:28.290> gonna

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.980 

put<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.260> here<00:03:35.130> where<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.370> see<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.150> then

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
put it here where I can see it and then

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.920 
put it here where I can see it and then
them<00:03:38.890> each<00:03:39.100> mount<00:03:39.430> has<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> calibrated<00:03:40.630> iris

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
them each mount has the calibrated iris

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.449 
them each mount has the calibrated iris
ring<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.350> test<00:03:41.590> stops<00:03:41.920> from<00:03:42.390> 140<00:03:43.390> 22<00:03:44.459> all

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
ring that test stops from 140 22 all

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.110 
ring that test stops from 140 22 all
these<00:03:45.760> stops<00:03:46.060> are<00:03:46.270> there<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.959> can<00:03:47.290> use

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
these stops are there so you can use

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.340 
these stops are there so you can use
this<00:03:49.120> mount<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:51.630> roughly<00:03:52.630> estimate<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
this mount and roughly estimate the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.930 
this mount and roughly estimate the
stock<00:03:53.620> us<00:03:54.070> with<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:56.080> iris<00:03:56.530> ring<00:03:56.709> on<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.070> Mount

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
stock us with the iris ring on the Mount

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.510 
stock us with the iris ring on the Mount
what<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.390> do<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.959> loosen<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.440> wrap<00:03:59.890> now

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
what you do is you loosen this wrap now

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.170 
what you do is you loosen this wrap now
and<00:04:02.040> depending<00:04:03.040> on<00:04:03.100> what<00:04:03.310> lens<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.730> using

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and depending on what lens you using

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.370 
and depending on what lens you using
this<00:04:04.300> is<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> lens<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.070> 2f<00:04:06.610> with<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.090> f28<00:04:07.660> star

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
this is a lens with a 2f with a f28 star

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.210 
this is a lens with a 2f with a f28 star
so<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.220> would<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:10.690> would<00:04:10.890> turn<00:04:11.890> it<00:04:12.040> clockwise

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
so you would you would turn it clockwise

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.990 
so you would you would turn it clockwise
and<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:14.170> wide<00:04:14.410> open<00:04:14.440> position<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.430> line<00:04:15.760> up

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
and it's wide open position and line up

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.539 
and it's wide open position and line up
your<00:04:16.030> 2:8<00:04:16.630> mark<00:04:17.019> with<00:04:17.350> your<00:04:17.500> index<00:04:17.950> mark<00:04:18.280> on

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
your 2:8 mark with your index mark on

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.409 
your 2:8 mark with your index mark on
the<00:04:18.790> camera<00:04:19.120> body<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.930> now<00:04:20.790> lock<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.820> with<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
the camera body and now lock it with the

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.530 
the camera body and now lock it with the
red<00:04:22.600> knob<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.260> from<00:04:23.830> now<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.280> all<00:04:24.790> your<00:04:25.150> stops

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
red knob and from now on all your stops

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.860 
red knob and from now on all your stops
will<00:04:25.990> be<00:04:26.200> pretty<00:04:26.860> much<00:04:27.070> correct<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:28.360> we<00:04:28.540> when

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
will be pretty much correct so we when

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.260 
will be pretty much correct so we when
it<00:04:29.050> shows<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.560> you're<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.160> 11<00:04:30.700> or<00:04:30.820> f-16

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
it shows that you're the 11 or f-16

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.090 
it shows that you're the 11 or f-16
that's<00:04:31.750> where<00:04:31.930> you're<00:04:32.050> going<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.290> be<00:04:32.470> on<00:04:32.890> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's where you're going to be on the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.400 
that's where you're going to be on the
land<00:04:33.310> even<00:04:33.490> though<00:04:33.610> there<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:34.030> no<00:04:34.210> iris<00:04:35.200> ring

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
land even though there is no iris ring

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.680 
land even though there is no iris ring
on<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.710> last<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:37.000> basically<00:04:37.300> that's<00:04:37.570> the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
on the last so basically that's the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.870 
on the last so basically that's the
basic<00:04:38.530> operation<00:04:39.130> of<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.640> night<00:04:40.300> controller
