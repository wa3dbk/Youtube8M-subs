00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279
 resolution of 800 x 480 pixels 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.859
 we'll get to the display right away 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.110
 First of all , the android have me here 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.420
 buttons 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.720
 but we have the left side 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.950
 Micro USB connection and no connections 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.050
 on the right side the 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.040
 volume control and rome the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.480
 headphones exit and the power button 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.930

 of course the speakers and one 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.190
 nice beats audio logo for it 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.870
 supports like audio and headphones 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.750
 and if you have your headphones here 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.260
 attaches a special profile 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.570
 lied 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.220
 make the battery cover very short 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.820
 so you in the connections 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.509
 be below 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 So we have a battery here 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.859
 should be around the 1000 2300 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.899
 Milliahs have so 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.350

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.149
 here a micro sd card slot and here 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.450
 you can use his normal sim card 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.789
 enter 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.430
 when it comes to one again you can see it here 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.180
 Back cover is made of plastic leaves 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.400
 bend slightly, but if it does 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.430
 after the device is then 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 felt very stable to that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 display off please very stable on and that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.350
 Market is called it does not look 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.120
 fingerprints magical 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.370
 Yes 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.870
 make the device very briefly and there 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.890
 you see this beautiful of the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.470
 Players is a lcd super lcd 2 display 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 So a very good quality you can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.530
 it looks and is all sides 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.450
 really very easy to read 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.820
 the colors are very very nice and crisp 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.210
 believes 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.940
 that's pretty much the highest level 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.960
 yes so it is very very sharp 800 x 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.370
 480 pixels is the resolution 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.580
 that is really a very nice one 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 display the phone is very good in the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.670
 hand 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.250
 It can be very easy with the thumb 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.260
 operate so one- handed operation is so 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.090
 easily possible or if you want to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.680
 For example, send a message and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.959
 says okay we want a new message 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 you can see here you have the good 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.770
 I do not touch the keyboard before, for example 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.890
 very good and you can then here 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.710
 very easy 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.250
 with a thumb type so very 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.330
 very nice 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.590
 who gets here on the android 4.0 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.319
 installed and that I show you the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.740
 software version 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.770
 namely the athletes but 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.250
 Yes 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.430
 android version 4.4 so very up to date 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.220
 and the htc sense version 4.1 time 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.110
 had android in a current one 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.240
 execution but again improved by 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.850
 HTC, for example, is the music player of 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.730
 htc I also like it very much with the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.720
 wimax very good always very short 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.770
 purely 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.770
 example magath 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
 there is the speaker 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.840
 and better the plaut is not the one now 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 best but it is today 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.200
 small very compact mobile phone it has one 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.810
 1 gigahertz dualcore processor with 6,768 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.090
 be megabyte and that was it 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.820
 very fast and very fluid you can see 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.270
 now start to go pretty much instantly 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.150
 once again 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.400
 in your browser there you see starts 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.780
 also immediately 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.960
 must now because of the missing one 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.760
 Load a bit or facebook 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.900
 It's just as fast and you can 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.780
 in facebook 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.670
 it is a very fast smartphone for 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.920
 relatively little money it comes in the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.130
 next two weeks out 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.599
 and will cost 299 euros 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.330
 I think that's a very good one 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.400
 Price for this smartphone is fast 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.989
 it is easy it is handy is good 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.560
 what does one actually want to process 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.520
 more 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.830
 until the htc desire iks on the htc 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.209
 I was at daniel
