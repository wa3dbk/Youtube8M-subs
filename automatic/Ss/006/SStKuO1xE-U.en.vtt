I'm<00:02:20.740> using<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.160> picked<00:02:21.400> us<00:02:21.550> up<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:22.470> Harbor

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
I'm using I picked us up at Harbor

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.130 
I'm using I picked us up at Harbor
Freight<00:02:23.880> fairly<00:02:24.880> inexpensive<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.990> can

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
Freight fairly inexpensive but you can

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.400 
Freight fairly inexpensive but you can
even<00:02:26.260> use<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.530> cheaper<00:02:27.600> voltmeter<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.080> this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
even use a cheaper voltmeter and this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.830 
even use a cheaper voltmeter and this
one<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:30.670> one<00:02:30.880> has<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> few<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.570> functions

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
one this one has a few more functions

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.320 
one this one has a few more functions
than<00:02:32.320> some<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.710> cheaper<00:02:33.100> units<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.730> works

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
than some of the cheaper units but works

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 
than some of the cheaper units but works
pretty<00:02:34.540> good<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.470> probes<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.160> using

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
pretty good the probes that I'm using

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.800 
pretty good the probes that I'm using
here<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.209> see<00:02:37.360> there<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.660> can

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
here as you can see there the if you can

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
here as you can see there the if you can
get<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.990> better<00:02:41.200> picture<00:02:41.830> here<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> basically

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
get a better picture here and basically

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
get a better picture here and basically
just<00:02:45.640> pull<00:02:45.910> back<00:02:45.940> into<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> tiny<00:02:46.750> probe<00:02:47.170> there

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
just pull back into a tiny probe there

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.040 
just pull back into a tiny probe there
that<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.800> can<00:02:48.010> go<00:02:49.000> ahead<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.360> grab<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.840> hole

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
that you can go ahead and grab the hole

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:59.520 
that you can go ahead and grab the hole
inside<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:51.870> jack<00:02:55.290> plug<00:02:57.480> safe<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
inside the a jack plug safe in here you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.050 
inside the a jack plug safe in here you
could<00:02:59.709> also<00:02:59.830> use<00:03:00.190> these<00:03:00.430> type<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:03.060> probe

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
could also use these type of probe

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.670 
could also use these type of probe
connectors<00:03:05.070> alligator<00:03:06.070> clip<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:08.410> then<00:03:08.560> that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
connectors alligator clip and then that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.350 
connectors alligator clip and then that
nice<00:03:08.890> insulation<00:03:09.489> around<00:03:09.850> here<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.209> don't

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
nice insulation around here so you don't

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.490 
nice insulation around here so you don't
short<00:03:10.750> out<00:03:12.420> okay<00:03:13.420> here's<00:03:13.720> bugera<00:03:14.320> V<00:03:14.910> 22<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.500> we

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
short out okay here's bugera V 22 and we

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.640 
short out okay here's bugera V 22 and we
have<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:17.890> set<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:19.630> biasing<00:03:20.110> setup<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
have it set up for the biasing setup and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.229 
have it set up for the biasing setup and
this<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.920> right<00:03:21.100> from<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.400> factory<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.060> this

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
this is right from the factory and this

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.440 
this is right from the factory and this
is<00:03:22.600> a<00:03:23.280> great<00:03:24.280> tone<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.150> got<00:03:25.390> here<00:03:27.450> bias

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
is a great tone that we got here bias

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.840 
is a great tone that we got here bias
controls<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:32.769> handle<00:03:33.160> RCA<00:03:33.610> jack<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.209> there

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
controls and we handle RCA jack in there

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.259 
controls and we handle RCA jack in there
our<00:03:36.850> probes<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:39.640> what<00:03:39.850> our<00:03:39.940> meters

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
our probes and that's what our meters

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.420 
our probes and that's what our meters
showing<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.410> we<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:41.830> turned<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.220> about

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
showing and we just turned it out about

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.259 
showing and we just turned it out about
a<00:03:42.489> minute<00:03:42.670> ago<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.799> looks<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:44.890> it's

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
a minute ago and looks like it's

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.800 
a minute ago and looks like it's

direct<00:03:53.590> current<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:54.610> got<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.910> meter<00:03:55.120> set

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
could easily switch these around here it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.620
