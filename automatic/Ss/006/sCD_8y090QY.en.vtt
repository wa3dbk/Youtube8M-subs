00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.680
 and then youtube people or links 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 rest here with samsung galaxy is six 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.300
 I just restored but I'll give you a tip 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.929
 quick here for you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 your s6 caught you were stirring 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.080
 something caught and cell phone that never 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 worked in my hand 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.029
 but if for some reason by some 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.410
 reason he crashed on some screen for 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.810
 eg for example here is locked 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 a screen and you can not restart the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.840
 because it does not have a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 r 7 button 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 There's no way you can take the battery out and there. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 You get desperate, he played a game. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.250
 locked 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 this procedure it serves both pro 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 samsung galaxy alpha for the a3 pro to 5 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.149
 for 7 it also serves for e5 and pro e 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 7 and also obviously for the s5 pro sc 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.039
 already the 5 o s6 you will push the button 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.180
 power and the button - it is certain that it will 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.250
 appear here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.870
 it will appear to reboot but when 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 it is locked it will not appear 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.680
 this screen here right then we will 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.210
 We'll miss those two. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.760
 buttons it will appear until the volume 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.610
 here but you count to 18 I think 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:17.810
 he restarted the appliance, let's go there 1 2 3 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 so we forced the reboot 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.979
 the apparatus where processing is caught 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 until it's late everything you do not 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.430
 You're going to lose nothing. It 's just a personal one. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 It's good to be there. 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 back to the right screen you have 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.000

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.659
