00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 video of frandroid where we will compare the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.920
 4x happiness with phones 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 competitors under android who are at 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.830
 same price or with performances that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 are a little better on the paper and 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
 we tried to compare in the facts 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's the same thing so 4x 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.990
 so has the week orridge 4g which is a 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.910
 phone at 229 euros even though he is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.910
 proposed at the moment to 179 euros with 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 a smell of 50 euros that has a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 screen 5 crowd you installs brian 410 and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 2 gigas ladies and we also have the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.320
 archos 50 dimon who is also 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 proposed at 200 euros as 4x honor 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.530
 and who has a processor 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.020
 snapdragon 615 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.440
 to note that 4x honor has him a 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.710
 kirin processor 620 its three 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.770
 phones are all 3 4g category 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 4 to compare the most power of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.469
 three phones we will realize 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.090
 first of all a test with in all a 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.439
 beautiful mark so that's gone we'll see 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.559
 what are the results for his three 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.559
 phones 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.820
 as you can see the test of 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.680
 hand to highlight that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.220
 4x honor is the big winner under 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.409
 test with 30 1641 points knowing that he 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.680
 so has a kirin 620 processor 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.509
 clocked at 1.2 gigahertz and 2 gigabytes 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.090
 of ram while his main 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.210
 competitor is the archos 50 dimon 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 which features only a tricky style 615 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 clocked at 1.6 ghz with 2 gigas of ram and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.830
 we can also notice that yes 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.630
 thomas m far behind at only 21 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.280
 1284 point will obviously be his 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.200
 410 snapdragon processor which is a bit 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.429
 less powerful than both processors 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.990
 competing phones 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.759
 we will now continue with 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.740
 three of the brands that allows management 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.539
 in particular the performances of the gpu and the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.399
 conjugation of the GPU and CPU on the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.979
 phone performance and one surrenders 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.049
 account for our tests that louis qu 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:13.910
 displays about 10 frames per second 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:17.150
 while the north is between 15 and 20 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.060
 frames per second and finally the archos 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.829
 displays up to 60 frames per second 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.750
 so it feels commitment on the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.640
 fluidity of the video on the archos who 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.280
 is the video is very fluid ya no 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.750
 jerks while on the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.819
 the honor is the same also the test 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 rather fluid while on the yes 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.230
 when we really see that image there 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.600
 is perhaps not necessarily see the screen 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.730
 at home but we really see that it 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.150
 jerks a little to the final result the yes 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.110
 that shows a score of 2676 which is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.880
 a little weak compared to both 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.510
 other phones since the north 4 x 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.620
 goes up to 3827 so we 're fine 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.690
 startle compared to the numbers of 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.180
 the image per second that displayed it in 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.860
 more compared to ricoh and then there the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.920
 bow 50 dimon went well above 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.590
 of his two friends since he shows 7 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.120
 1658 so that's going a big score which is 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.780
 much more important than the two 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.360
 competitors here is a last benchmark 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.790
 to study the processors of the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.330
 different geekbench phones 3 we get 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.730
 realize that the yes that is still a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.720
 times far behind with a score for a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:29.030
 single heart of 479 while 4x honor 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.140
 poster 542 and the archos 675 the honor 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.959
 4x is much closer to 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.239
 archos performance in multi version 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:40.790
 core where they display almost 2200 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.860
 against 2448 for the archos let's go 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.170
 now to a test of the power of the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.610
 4g network with 4g brand application 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.450
 which will allow us to test the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.459
 differences between the different 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.400
 appliances 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.209
 the signal strength and the power 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.739
 of the debit to note that his three 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.260
 phones have all three 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.970
 of a telecom chip Bouygues que alger that 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.100
 we are doing a test in paris intra 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.750
 muros and so what appears is that 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.600
 the yes corric 4g shows a score of 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.150
 4.84 megabit per second while the 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.340
 4x black top shows a throughput of 14.33 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.150
 megabits per second what is a 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.940
 more than yes while while the archos 50 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.380
 dimon has a score of 2.76 megabit 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.930
 per second so that's enough 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.510
 bad it's much worse than the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.280
 two other phones we want to see 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 that north 4 6 and a phone that has 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.290
 is doing very well and better than his two 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.790
 direct competitors 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.160
 now we will try to understand 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.180
 why this phone picks up a little better 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.210
 so you can see here the north lot 4 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.669
 x has a bm -84 while 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.440
 competitors 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.430
 darcos has as for yvonne is a minus 87 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.830
 and the wiko reach 4g to -91 that means 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.479
 this figure this means that the more the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.900
 close to zero plus the phone is going 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.320
 well capture the Quebec antenna is the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.290
 closer 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.000
 that is, better and will capture more 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.570
 it can have a significant flow even 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.370
 if they stay within the limits 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.500
 theoretical of the flow that he may have 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.970
 that is, a phone that lto-4 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.320
 gorica you will not be able to have a 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.850
 greater power than 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.949
 phone that category 6 for example 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.960
 but it will be better than others 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.770
 category 4 phones so how 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.479
 that is possible 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.610
 it comes from an element is that already 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.300
 firstly the 4 x honor has 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.600
 technology 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.330
 lds ie the antennas are 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.220
 engraved directly on the plastic of 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.750
 the hull inside so not on 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.039
 the item you can remove but 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.510
 seldom on the element where you insert 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.610
 your your sim card 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.380
 yeah yeah ok the parent of north 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.039
 has a specific patent on this 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.740
 technology 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.570
 lds or in fact they will use the two 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.270
 different modes so there is a mode ifa 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.139
 and a cloud mode and huawei brought together 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.530
 two teeth 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.789
 in a soil that allows better capture 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.090
 after testing the calquer on the to 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.960
 honor 4x the yes corric 4g and the archos 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.830
 50 dimon 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.110
 we tested the gadget against 4x and 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.819
 the galaxy sii is the asus henson of 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.879
 why this phone unlike the 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.039
 week at the ritz 4g and hoarau 50 dimon who 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.710
 were both 4g phones 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.050
 category 4 the galaxy sii and luc adjÃ © 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.210
 category 6 while the iphone asus of 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.050
 oil category 4 but it has 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.539
 zts technology that allows for better 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.129
 capture as on the honor 4x so we 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.330
 will be able to compare on two phones 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.400
 who have technologies so well 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.430
 unlike the 4x 9 which features the 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.879
 technology lds that aggregates both a 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.340
 fashion nor makeup and a fashion we asus 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.319
 deficiencies of this technology 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.639
 so he should be unavailable at 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.689
 level of performance that we tested that 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.879
 right now 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.969
 the 4x honor is still with the 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:50.180
 honors with a score of 16 0 3 while 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:53.629
 that at this young woman 's poster a 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.180
 figure of 13.71 megabit per second is 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:59.960
 that the samsung galaxy s 600 displays a 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.120
 score of 9.37 megabit per second so 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.740
 4x honor is really very good on 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.810
 galaxy ace 6 we realize that the 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.649
 signal strength it is minus 89 db 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:15.100
 m while the 4x honor and tackle -82 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:17.980
 dbm is the asus n fun ii and ac - 91 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.780
 dbm we have andorre 4x which seems better 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.730
 capture the cadec competitors 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.300
 expect the same conditions with the same 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.250
 operator 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.890
 it's all three like everything to 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:30.310
 flea hour 4g kick them out when 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.630
 even in conclusion we can say that 

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.390
 4x honor your iphone which is very 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.160
 competitive for a product that is 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.170
 proposed at least 1,200 euros 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.120
 he has just a few small weaknesses 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.100
 it would seem on the party 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.780
 chart will it still remain a 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.070
 product that is very competitive and which 

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.350
 is way above a snapdragon 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.790
 410 and above all it's a good surprise 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.140
 at the 4g level because even though 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.020
 is not that they were killing category 6 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.030
 which has a category 4 that seems 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.500
 work very well and that compared to 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.880
 other phones that are even 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.080
 phones in version 4g category 6 

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.190
 this break of performances that are 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.160
 quite equivalent to even seeing 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.330
 sometimes at the top so stop a 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.320
 phone that is very interesting and 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.610
 which will certainly be interesting to 

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.610
 follow in the future
