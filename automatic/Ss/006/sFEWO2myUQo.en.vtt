sense of humor so she said brother why
do<00:01:54.489> you<00:01:54.819> think<00:01:54.910> when<00:01:55.450> geese<00:01:55.750> fly<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:56.470> that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
do you think when geese fly like that

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.790 
do you think when geese fly like that
there's<00:01:57.009> always<00:01:57.399> one<00:01:58.090> fewer<00:01:58.629> on<00:01:58.929> one<00:01:59.170> side<00:01:59.500> of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
there's always one fewer on one side of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.029 
there's always one fewer on one side of
the<00:02:00.129> V<00:02:00.310> than<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.729> other<00:02:01.200> why<00:02:02.200> do<00:02:02.259> they<00:02:02.649> fly<00:02:02.890> in

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
the V than the other why do they fly in

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.419 
the V than the other why do they fly in
a<00:02:03.250> V<00:02:03.280> formation<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:04.539> they<00:02:05.259> fly<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.770> way<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
a V formation and they fly that way and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.270 
a V formation and they fly that way and
I<00:02:06.759> thought<00:02:06.970> there<00:02:07.119> must<00:02:07.239> be<00:02:07.420> some<00:02:07.599> kind<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.929> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I thought there must be some kind of a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.880 
I thought there must be some kind of a
scientific<00:02:09.280> explanation<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:10.270> why<00:02:11.050> there's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
scientific explanation of why there's

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.350 
scientific explanation of why there's
one<00:02:12.099> fewer<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.580> one<00:02:12.760> side<00:02:13.030> than<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.269> other

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
one fewer on one side than the other

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.900 
one fewer on one side than the other
maybe<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.930> has<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.080> do<00:02:14.319> with<00:02:14.470> aerodynamics<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.700> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
maybe it has to do with aerodynamics I I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.530 
maybe it has to do with aerodynamics I I
don't<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.739> sister<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.519> so<00:02:19.239> fun

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
don't know and my sister was so so fun

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.809 
don't know and my sister was so so fun
she<00:02:19.959> was<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.110> wonderful<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:21.010> she<00:02:21.099> just

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
she was just wonderful and she just

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.369 
she was just wonderful and she just
looked<00:02:22.000> at<00:02:22.060> me<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.209> said<00:02:22.390> brother<00:02:22.660> because

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
looked at me and said brother because

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.750 
looked at me and said brother because
there's<00:02:23.530> one<00:02:23.709> fewer<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:24.340> side<00:02:24.550> than<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
there's one fewer on one side than the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.610 
there's one fewer on one side than the
other<00:02:24.849> da<00:02:26.220> okay<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.700> got<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:29.080> anyway<00:02:29.440> there

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
other da okay I got it but anyway there

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.300 
other da okay I got it but anyway there
are<00:02:29.650> some<00:02:29.860> interest

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
are some interest

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250 
are some interest
let's<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.880> back<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> geese<00:02:31.450> when<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
let's get back to the geese when it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.949 
let's get back to the geese when it
comes<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.920> leadership<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.750> learn

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
comes to leadership that we can learn

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.880 
comes to leadership that we can learn
from<00:02:35.260> geese<00:02:36.099> flying<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.060> V<00:02:37.090> formation

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
from geese flying in a V formation

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.080 
from geese flying in a V formation
oftentimes<00:02:38.890> when<00:02:39.099> geese<00:02:39.310> fly<00:02:39.610> they're<00:02:39.849> flying

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
oftentimes when geese fly they're flying

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.479 
oftentimes when geese fly they're flying
thousands<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.050> miles<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.650> mean<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> long

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
thousands of miles I mean this is a long

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.330 
thousands of miles I mean this is a long
journey<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> what<00:02:44.260> they<00:02:44.440> do<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.709> they<00:02:45.040> take

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
journey so what they do is they take

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.420 
journey so what they do is they take
turns<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:46.930> different<00:02:47.349> geese<00:02:47.590> leading<00:02:48.310> at

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
turns with different geese leading at

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.420 
turns with different geese leading at
the<00:02:48.459> point<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.150> V<00:02:49.680> because<00:02:50.680> leaders<00:02:51.220> can

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the point of the V because leaders can

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.120 
the point of the V because leaders can
get<00:02:51.610> tired<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:52.959> leaders<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.739> also<00:02:53.890> achieve

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
get tired but leaders can also achieve

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.300 
get tired but leaders can also achieve
more<00:02:54.790> leaders<00:02:55.780> can<00:02:55.989> also<00:02:56.140> get<00:02:56.530> there<00:02:56.769> first

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
more leaders can also get there first

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.110 
more leaders can also get there first
and<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.540> important<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.019> show<00:02:59.319> leadership

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
and so it's important to show leadership

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.410 
and so it's important to show leadership
but<00:03:01.120> anyway<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:02.170> lead<00:03:02.560> goose<00:03:03.160> would<00:03:04.030> continue

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
but anyway the lead goose would continue

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
but anyway the lead goose would continue
flying<00:03:04.660> until<00:03:05.019> they<00:03:05.170> would<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.470> tired<00:03:05.739> and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
flying until they would get tired and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.009 
flying until they would get tired and
the<00:03:06.310> neck<00:03:06.489> goose<00:03:06.730> would<00:03:06.970> drop<00:03:07.180> back<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> V

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
the neck goose would drop back in the V

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.600 
the neck goose would drop back in the V
and<00:03:08.290> another<00:03:08.590> one<00:03:08.799> would<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.370> front

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
and another one would go to the front

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.910 
and another one would go to the front
and<00:03:09.880> continue<00:03:10.870> moving<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.500> whole<00:03:11.620> V

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and continue moving the whole V

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.190 
and continue moving the whole V
formation<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.819> their<00:03:13.450> journey<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:14.019> wherever

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
formation on their journey to wherever

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.039 
formation on their journey to wherever
they're<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.519> incredible<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.239> if

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
they're going is that incredible and if

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.009 
they're going is that incredible and if
one<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.980> geese<00:03:18.220> would<00:03:18.880> get<00:03:19.120> injured<00:03:19.780> or

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
one of the geese would get injured or

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.580 
one of the geese would get injured or
get<00:03:20.650> too<00:03:20.890> tired<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.519> need<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.120> land<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:23.410> other

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
get too tired and need to land to other

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.410 
get too tired and need to land to other
geese<00:03:23.890> would<00:03:24.130> always<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.549> down<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.090> make<00:03:25.360> sure

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
geese would always go down and make sure

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.650 
geese would always go down and make sure
that<00:03:25.840> goose<00:03:26.560> was<00:03:27.099> doing<00:03:27.400> okay<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.510> not

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
that goose was doing okay it's not

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.240 
that goose was doing okay it's not
amazing<00:03:28.900> doesn't<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.530> show<00:03:29.799> something

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
amazing doesn't that show something

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.880 
amazing doesn't that show something
about<00:03:30.459> support<00:03:31.090> systems<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.620> they<00:03:32.650> would

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
about support systems so they would

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.440 
about support systems so they would
always<00:03:33.130> make<00:03:33.250> sure<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.849> one<00:03:34.030> goose<00:03:34.209> was

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
always make sure that that one goose was

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.360 
always make sure that that one goose was
okay<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:34.989> able<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.320> get<00:03:35.440> back<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.950> eventually

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
okay was able to get back and eventually

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.789 
okay was able to get back and eventually
catch<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:36.910> with<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.840> group<00:03:38.109> with<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.290> group<00:03:38.530> and

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
catch up with the group with a group and

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.410 
catch up with the group with a group and
so<00:03:39.400> there<00:03:39.549> are<00:03:39.609> a<00:03:39.700> lot<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.820> lessons<00:03:40.090> we<00:03:40.390> can

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
so there are a lot of lessons we can

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.890 
so there are a lot of lessons we can
learn<00:03:40.600> from<00:03:41.109> these<00:03:41.890> geese<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.640> how<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.420> work

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
learn from these geese and how they work

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.830 
learn from these geese and how they work
together<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:45.070> how<00:03:45.760> they<00:03:46.150> show<00:03:46.510> leadership

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
together and how they show leadership

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.069 
together and how they show leadership
and<00:03:47.440> take<00:03:47.620> turns<00:03:48.069> being<00:03:48.400> leaders<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.569> no<00:03:49.810> one

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079
