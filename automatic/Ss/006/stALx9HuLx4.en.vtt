 Sevan glasses Korean manufacturers also 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.890
 have chosen this device and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.329
 proof qumo quest 474 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.520
 despite the fact that the device is very similar to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.850
 the river Sevan is not a few differences 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.219
 for example the qumo quest 474 case is made of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 the plastic body is absolutely smooth and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.469

 reliably weighs this miracle 143 grams whole 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 the device looks more expensive than it costs 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.559
 appearance difference can be added 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.100
 the absence of the second speaker at the points Sevan 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.530

 scary reliability in action i don't 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 feel 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.700

 for sim card and memory card 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.020
 battery capacity of only 2000 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.329
 milliampere hours in the work device 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 last approximately 10-12 hours 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.860
 shorter for a whole working day is enough 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.180

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 flash and autofocus system 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 photo quality is acceptable in 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.530
 ratio with the price the camera writes full hd 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.689
 video 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.180

 1280 720 dots per 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.650
 surprise the screen turned out to be decent 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.600
 contrast and colors are fine 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.400
 hilt matrix provided large angles 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.180
 review both vertically as well as 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.490
 horizontals 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.070
 although there are minuses bright solar 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.959
 weather without glare and a certain 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.430
 extinction of the displayed data on the display 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.770
 still not enough 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.840
 oleophobic coating is also forgotten 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.630

 operating system android 4 2 1 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.390
 the interface runs smoothly some 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.120
 I can not single out the features 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.750
 the stuffing of the gadget is represented by a chipset 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.060
 mediatek mt6589 quad 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.170

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.280
 expand on micro sd memory cards even on 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.700
 32 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.230
 In the benchmark tag Hume quest 474 showed 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.780
 not bad for your stuffing 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.810
 the results but in practice it go 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.410
 almost any games and if you donâ€™t go 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.120
 lower the qumo quest 474 resolution when 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.489
 its technical characteristics 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.560
