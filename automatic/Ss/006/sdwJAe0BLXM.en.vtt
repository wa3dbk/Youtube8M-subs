00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.110 
picked a really strong lot of energy
there<00:03:17.230> are<00:03:17.380> certain<00:03:17.890> moments<00:03:17.920> where<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
there are certain moments where the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.960 
there are certain moments where the
energy<00:03:19.450> was<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:19.959> high<00:03:20.920> there<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.459> almost

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
energy was so high there was almost

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.670
