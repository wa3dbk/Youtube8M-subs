00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.170
 Hello dear viewers with you channel 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.480
 tea shop today as I promised 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 I will show a more detailed overview on the microphone 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 which came to me from tom top shop 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.340
 unpacking the parcel from this store you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.800
 can see here so let's get started 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 He came to the microphone itself in this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.130
 the packaging is nothing good 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 broke down everything got nowhere 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.129
 so accessories 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 among the components there is such 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.629
 stand is very convenient for the microphone 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 she is well worth her good 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.760
 sustainability and made of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.520
 quality plastic 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 Next came the xlr cable with 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:01.309
 exit on the mini g35 well, everything is in principle 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.309
 now come back on the microphone 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.570
 noise canceling microphone too nothing 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 squeaks does not crunch 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.979
 made with quality on the socket there 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.350
 adjustment of the rocker rocker 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.150
 volume control bottom xlr connector 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 but pokamis I will debug the microphone 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 tell you a little about him 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.290
 sensitivity characteristics 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 from minus 55 to two decibels he 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 noise-canceling as I said 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.350
 resistance less than 2 and 2 kilomas 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.340
 103 decibel desensitization 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.159
 operating voltage one and a half volts 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.880
 frequency range of this microphone is 50 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.020
 Hertz to 16 kilohertz ratio 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.969
 signal-to-noise over 36 dc gave so in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.969
 principle like this 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.020
 folded state 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.729
 our microphone looks also the length of the cord 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.180
 equal to 2 meters now I will try 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.489
 record 2 audio recordings 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.670
 to compare my old microphone 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.470
 which let's say so insignificant and this 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.400
 more or less sane it is not 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.770
 professional 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.959
 but much better microphone just one 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.330
 which I have so let's 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.940
 look dear friends I specifically 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.739
 already prepared two audio recordings which 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 recorded under the same conditions in order 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.410
 so we can compare both microphones and 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.820
 so let's listen to the first entry 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.650
 sample recording microphone number one 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.760
 which is attached to my headphones and not 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.980
 possessing particularly good 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.610
 characteristics 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.360
 so and record number two is a trial record 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.519
 number two 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.580
 the microphone that came to me from the store 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.319
 tom top 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.989
 as you can see the second entry 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.140
 more quality and it is obvious because 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.750
 the difference between two microphones 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 colossal well dear friends on 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.450
