00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
Rinnegan he couldn't food he couldn't

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.490 
Rinnegan he couldn't food he couldn't
fully<00:05:15.840> utilize<00:05:16.289> his<00:05:16.470> Rinnegan<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:19.020> when<00:05:19.380> we

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
fully utilize his Rinnegan but when we

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.469 
fully utilize his Rinnegan but when we
see<00:05:19.710> him<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:19.919> this<00:05:20.039> chapter<00:05:20.310> he<00:05:20.550> has<00:05:20.880> a<00:05:21.060> regular

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
see him in this chapter he has a regular

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.900 
see him in this chapter he has a regular
running<00:05:21.750> guy<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.050> not<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.169> Sharingan<00:05:23.070> so<00:05:23.760> I'm

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
running guy and not a Sharingan so I'm

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.110 
running guy and not a Sharingan so I'm
thinking<00:05:24.240> okay<00:05:24.600> so<00:05:24.630> maybe<00:05:25.169> he<00:05:25.860> can<00:05:26.550> actually

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
thinking okay so maybe he can actually

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.100 
thinking okay so maybe he can actually
go<00:05:27.600> into<00:05:27.750> Sharingan<00:05:28.410> mode<00:05:28.710> at<00:05:29.669> will<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.930> like

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
go into Sharingan mode at will and like

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.770 
go into Sharingan mode at will and like
his<00:05:31.320> base<00:05:31.590> left<00:05:32.340> eye<00:05:32.550> form<00:05:32.970> is<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.419> Rinnegan

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
his base left eye form is the Rinnegan

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.390 
his base left eye form is the Rinnegan
something<00:05:34.410> like<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:34.800> don't<00:05:35.100> know<00:05:35.190> that's

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
something like that I don't know that's

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.890 
something like that I don't know that's
my<00:05:35.639> assumption<00:05:36.000> but<00:05:36.300> it's<00:05:36.419> not<00:05:36.539> confirmed

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
my assumption but it's not confirmed

either<00:05:37.620> way<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.460> fact<00:05:38.699> of<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.880> matter<00:05:38.910> here

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
either way the fact of the matter here

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.469 
either way the fact of the matter here
is<00:05:39.419> that<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.860> it<00:05:41.280> was<00:05:41.370> embarrassing<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:42.060> both

their<00:05:42.690> parts<00:05:42.870> because<00:05:43.650> that<00:05:44.340> should<00:05:44.700> be

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
their parts because that should be

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.779 
their parts because that should be
inexcusable<00:05:45.419> not<00:05:45.990> using<00:05:46.800> your<00:05:46.889> Susanoo<00:05:47.400> as
