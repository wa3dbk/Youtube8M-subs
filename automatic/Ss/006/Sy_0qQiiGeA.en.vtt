emulation<00:02:54.099> then<00:02:54.849> want<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.120> go<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.269> content<00:02:56.190> 0

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
emulation then want to go to content 0

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.900 
emulation then want to go to content 0
the<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:58.030> long<00:02:58.390> zero<00:02:58.780> number<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.790> we're

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
the really long zero number then we're

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.120 
the really long zero number then we're
gonna<00:03:01.030> scroll<00:03:01.390> down<00:03:01.660> until<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.680> see<00:03:02.799> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
triple F yeah triple F e07 d1 so that's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.680 
triple F yeah triple F e07 d1 so that's
triple<00:03:09.220> F<00:03:09.780> e07<00:03:10.780> d1<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.670> once<00:03:13.329> we're<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:13.540> there

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
triple F e07 d1 so once we're in there

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.140 
triple F e07 d1 so once we're in there
you've<00:03:14.019> got<00:03:14.079> triple<00:03:14.739> zero<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.340> into<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.030> then

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you've got triple zero and into and then

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.960 
you've got triple zero and into and then
quad<00:03:16.750> zero<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.590> going<00:03:17.739> into<00:03:17.859> that<00:03:18.010> one<00:03:18.130> then

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
quad zero just going into that one then

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.670 
quad zero just going into that one then
you're<00:03:19.150> gonna<00:03:19.239> have<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:20.019> might<00:03:20.260> have<00:03:20.440> some

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
you can do is you may get the giant game

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.740 
you can do is you may get the giant game
up<00:03:26.680> except<00:03:26.950> at<00:03:27.100> peak<00:03:27.670> back<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.630> wanna

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
up except at peak back and you wanna

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.080 
up except at peak back and you wanna
just<00:03:28.840> stick<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.850> shouldn't

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
just stick that in there it shouldn't

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.520 
just stick that in there it shouldn't
take<00:03:31.180> too<00:03:31.299> long<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.870> should<00:03:31.900> only<00:03:32.109> take<00:03:32.260> more

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
take too long it should only take more

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.050 
take too long it should only take more
for<00:03:32.680> me<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.859> goes<00:03:33.220> really<00:03:33.370> quick<00:03:33.700> but<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.940> know

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
for me it goes really quick but you know

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.879 
for me it goes really quick but you know
some<00:03:34.480> computers<00:03:34.900> are<00:03:35.019> slow<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.500> does<00:03:35.650> take

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
some computers are slow so it does take

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.430 
some computers are slow so it does take
a<00:03:36.130> long<00:03:36.400> time<00:03:36.639> but<00:03:36.850> it's<00:03:37.150> right<00:03:37.329> it's<00:03:37.510> done<00:03:37.720> so

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
a long time but it's right it's done so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.830 
a long time but it's right it's done so
once<00:03:38.859> it's<00:03:39.010> done<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.150> can<00:03:40.480> go<00:03:40.600> back<00:03:40.720> over

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
once it's done now you can go back over

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.020 
once it's done now you can go back over
