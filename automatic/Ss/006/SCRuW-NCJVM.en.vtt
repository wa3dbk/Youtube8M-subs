00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.149
 hi hello to all today I bring you this 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.390
 video of how to make this super smoothie 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.280
 rich and high in fiber with some 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.610
 ingredients well easy landmarks of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.309
 get and super cheap that you have 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.749
 in your house I'll bet you the only thing 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.929
 we are going to need 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:24.259
 I'm going to use an ordinary apple 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.100
 size as I will use the liquidator already 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.640
 I have it chopped 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 Y 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.010
 a pretty big fist of carrots 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.430
 babies or regular carrots if you 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.430
 you want 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.840
 I'll be using two tablespoons of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.840
 raisins 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.490
 this is optional I'm going to use a 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.850
 teaspoon of honey 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.490
 avn to two tablespoons I will be using 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.130
 you can use whole oats if all 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.380
 you want it to be a little lower in 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:11.000
 fats and more nutritious 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.009
 and could not miss the ice and milk and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.079
 I like that it is not so thick 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.340
 then I'm going to add a lot and the 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.340
 Milestone and enough milk 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.530
 this is optional also to two 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 spoonfuls of peanut butter 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.760
 they provide seven grams of protein 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.760
 nothing else I will use a spoonful 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.600
 Now I have to put all the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 ingredients in the blender 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.530
 everything all everything and if you have to leave 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.049
 pretty soon to move well 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.270
 because as it is apple and healthy now is 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.149
 a little hard and so you do not have 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.060
 that feeling so thick good if you 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.509
 like thick is the personal taste to me 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.049
 not then I left it for quite some time 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.320
 he was beating or grinding as he 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.320
 call 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.420
 as I told them nothing else I use a 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 spoonful of this honey you can put 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.180
 sugar you can add vanilla is the 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.300
 like everyone I like about me 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 this way 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.220
 and as my teaspoon of 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.590
 Butter 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 two tablespoons of this brings the same 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.510
 amount that one of those bars 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.210
 proteins that you buy to make muscle 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.210
 keep it in mind and my milk 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.400
 and now to leave it with about ten 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.050
 grinding minutes do not create anything else 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.280
 about two minutes 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.980
 it's ready 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.930
 nothing thick if you do not like thick 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.520
 because the truth is quite difficult 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.700
 try to eat it and take it and with 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.990
 that feeling that is like atole and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.990
 It is liquefied, as it is not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.190
 Y 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.190
 and I 'm going to put a little cinnamon 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.190
 to make it look pretty 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.150
 you can add it before in the blender 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.160
 to give it another flavor but nothing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.160
 I put it on top 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 amen this serves me as for two glasses 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.150
 also or a big glass I take it a 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.680
 big glass of these and I take it during 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.080
 the morning and it serves me 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.050
 I fill this liquefied enough you're going to 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.150
 do super good you will not be hungry 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.970
 for several hours the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.210
 I recommend very much I hope you like it
