00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
see Adrien Broner as being the type of

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.490 
see Adrien Broner as being the type of
fighter<00:05:13.460> this<00:05:14.150> el<00:05:14.360> que<00:05:14.540> ya<00:05:14.810> fighting<00:05:15.260> but<00:05:15.380> he

seems<00:05:17.900> like<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.140> type<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.320> fighter<00:05:18.650> who<00:05:18.830> were

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
seems like the type of fighter who were

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.370 
seems like the type of fighter who were
glove<00:05:19.190> over<00:05:19.520> anybody<00:05:19.940> anyway<00:05:20.420> class<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:21.260> know

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
glove over anybody anyway class you know

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.810 
glove over anybody anyway class you know
that's<00:05:21.560> one<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.920> reasons<00:05:22.160> why<00:05:22.250> fans<00:05:22.490> love

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
that's one of the reasons why fans love

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.090 
that's one of the reasons why fans love
him<00:05:22.850> you<00:05:23.210> know<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.780> even<00:05:24.500> if<00:05:24.590> they<00:05:24.650> do<00:05:24.710> Haiti

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
him you know like even if they do Haiti

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.430 
him you know like even if they do Haiti
they<00:05:25.700> know<00:05:25.910> that<00:05:26.120> like<00:05:26.720> he's<00:05:26.870> not<00:05:27.050> no<00:05:27.200> sucker

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
they know that like he's not no sucker

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.350 
they know that like he's not no sucker
so<00:05:28.130> I'm<00:05:28.250> thinking<00:05:28.310> like<00:05:28.640> when<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.180> catch

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
so I'm thinking like when it to catch

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.510 
so I'm thinking like when it to catch
way<00:05:29.570> come<00:05:29.810> from<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.650> because<00:05:30.770> Andrew<00:05:31.280> Brown

way come from is it because Andrew Brown

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.660 
way come from is it because Andrew Brown
a<00:05:31.640> is<00:05:31.700> the<00:05:31.850> more<00:05:32.030> marketable<00:05:32.780> star<00:05:33.200> and<00:05:33.670> big
