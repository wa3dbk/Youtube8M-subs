spawning<00:02:32.340> pool<00:02:32.580> soon<00:02:32.790> enough<00:02:33.060> unless<00:02:33.210> he's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
spawning pool soon enough unless he's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.230 
spawning pool soon enough unless he's
going<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:33.840> three

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
going for three

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.390 
going for three
before<00:02:34.600> pull<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.200> don't<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:36.040> he's<00:02:36.130> going<00:02:36.280> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
before pull I don't think he's going to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.650 
before pull I don't think he's going to
do<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:36.700> although<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> possibility

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
do that although it is a possibility

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.940 
do that although it is a possibility
there<00:02:38.200> comes<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.470> spawning<00:02:38.710> pool<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.700> shine<00:02:40.950> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
there comes a spawning pool for shine so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.770 
there comes a spawning pool for shine so
we<00:02:42.370> are<00:02:42.490> going<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> see<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.850> nice<00:02:43.000> standard<00:02:43.510> game

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
we are going to see a nice standard game

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.660 
we are going to see a nice standard game
from<00:02:44.080> these<00:02:44.230> two<00:02:44.440> guys<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.860> close<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.430> thing

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
from these two guys to close this thing

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.510 
from these two guys to close this thing
out<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.380> high<00:02:47.380> up<00:02:47.590> plate<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.100> good<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.430> that

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
out and high up plate so good in that

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.730 
out and high up plate so good in that
first<00:02:48.910> set<00:02:49.210> I'm<00:02:49.600> starting<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.260> think<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
first set I'm starting to think the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.250 
first set I'm starting to think the
second<00:02:51.100> set<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.280> kind<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.880> fluke<00:02:52.240> from<00:02:53.020> him

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
second set was kind of a fluke from him

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.500 
second set was kind of a fluke from him
well<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> just<00:02:54.220> kind<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.430> crumble<00:02:54.850> didn't<00:02:55.090> quite

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
well I just kind of crumble didn't quite

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.030 
well I just kind of crumble didn't quite
have<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:56.110> wall<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.770> he<00:02:56.830> needed

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
have the right wall in that he needed

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.580 
have the right wall in that he needed
that's<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.880> nice<00:02:58.030> angle<00:02:58.330> it's<00:02:59.020> always<00:02:59.260> great

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
that's a nice angle it's always great

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170 
that's a nice angle it's always great
when<00:02:59.620> these<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.130> cameraman<00:03:00.580> do<00:03:00.790> different

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
when these the cameraman do different

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820 
when these the cameraman do different
angles<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:01.840> they're<00:03:02.050> very<00:03:02.230> set<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.740> their

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
angles because they're very set in their

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.910 
angles because they're very set in their
ways<00:03:03.070> as<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.060> what<00:03:04.240> they<00:03:04.360> do<00:03:04.680> shaking<00:03:05.680> things

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
ways as to what they do shaking things

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.940 
ways as to what they do shaking things
up<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.220> little<00:03:06.370> bit<00:03:07.140> no<00:03:08.140> high<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.500> going<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.860> go

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
up a little bit no high is going to go

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.030 
up a little bit no high is going to go
out<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.340> throw<00:03:09.400> down<00:03:09.850> his<00:03:10.150> command<00:03:10.720> center<00:03:11.080> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
out and throw down his command center so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.350 
out and throw down his command center so
we're<00:03:12.310> probably<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> see<00:03:12.850> Shaun<00:03:13.150> get

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
we're probably going to see Shaun get

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.150 
we're probably going to see Shaun get
his<00:03:13.420> third<00:03:13.810> base<00:03:14.080> soon<00:03:14.350> enough<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.800> try<00:03:15.100> to

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
his third base soon enough just try to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.280 
his third base soon enough just try to
compete<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.820> higher<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.690> hi<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.900> did<00:03:17.140> put

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
compete with higher here hi it did put

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.750 
compete with higher here hi it did put
down<00:03:17.500> his<00:03:17.650> barracks<00:03:18.010> first<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.490> didn't<00:03:18.700> go

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
down his barracks first you didn't go

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.000 
down his barracks first you didn't go
for<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:18.970> 14<00:03:19.390> cc<00:03:19.780> or<00:03:19.810> anything<00:03:20.290> that's<00:03:20.830> just

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
for a 14 cc or anything that's just

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620 
for a 14 cc or anything that's just
because<00:03:21.190> he<00:03:21.430> knows<00:03:21.610> how<00:03:21.790> aggressive<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.390> player

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
because he knows how aggressive a player

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.140 
because he knows how aggressive a player
shine<00:03:23.050> can<00:03:23.290> be<00:03:23.440> when<00:03:23.620> he<00:03:23.710> wants<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:23.980> be<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.400> mean

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
shine can be when he wants to be I mean

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.910 
shine can be when he wants to be I mean
that's<00:03:25.600> how<00:03:25.900> he<00:03:25.960> did<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.440> well<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.740> ever

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that's how he did so well in the ever

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.310 
that's how he did so well in the ever
OSL<00:03:27.490> going<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:27.970> super<00:03:28.240> aggressive<00:03:28.720> plays<00:03:28.990> I'm

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
OSL going for super aggressive plays I'm

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.350 
OSL going for super aggressive plays I'm
remembering<00:03:30.100> his<00:03:30.280> last<00:03:30.520> game<00:03:30.700> against<00:03:31.000> torque

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
remembering his last game against torque

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.510 
remembering his last game against torque
it<00:03:31.570> was<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:31.840> such<00:03:32.020> an<00:03:32.230> aggressive<00:03:32.740> forward

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
it was just such an aggressive forward

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.120 
it was just such an aggressive forward
push<00:03:33.790> with<00:03:34.390> hydras<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:34.870> muta<00:03:35.800> less<00:03:35.950> at<00:03:36.100> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
push with hydras and muta less at the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.940 
push with hydras and muta less at the
same<00:03:36.280> time<00:03:37.230> very<00:03:38.230> very<00:03:38.530> scary<00:03:38.860> thing

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
same time very very scary thing

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.040 
same time very very scary thing
especially<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.820> Heartbreak<00:03:40.300> Ridge<00:03:40.330> which<00:03:40.900> was

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
especially on Heartbreak Ridge which was

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.090 
especially on Heartbreak Ridge which was
what<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:42.040> map<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.550> game<00:03:42.760> was<00:03:42.940> on

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
what what the map that that game was on

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.990 
what what the map that that game was on
it's<00:03:45.100> going<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.490> little<00:03:45.670> bit<00:03:45.850> more

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
it's going to be a little bit more

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.430 
it's going to be a little bit more
difficult<00:03:46.150> for<00:03:46.420> trying<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:46.960> that<00:03:47.080> done<00:03:47.290> on

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
difficult for trying to get that done on

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800 
difficult for trying to get that done on
these<00:03:47.530> four<00:03:47.830> player<00:03:48.100> maps<00:03:48.430> as<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.240> see<00:03:49.420> try<00:03:49.750> to

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
these four player maps as you see try to

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.750 
these four player maps as you see try to
be<00:03:49.960> as<00:03:50.080> aggressive<00:03:50.230> as<00:03:50.500> possible<00:03:51.250> on<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.520> of<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
be as aggressive as possible on I of the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.610 
be as aggressive as possible on I of the
storm<00:03:52.090> but<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.750> map<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.050> going<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.410> be<00:03:53.470> even

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
storm but this map is going to be even

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.250 
storm but this map is going to be even
more<00:03:53.980> difficult<00:03:54.280> with<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.790> giant<00:03:55.060> Ridge<00:03:55.480> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
more difficult with that giant Ridge the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
time around I think it's gonna be a lot

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.350 
time around I think it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:29.200> hold<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.310> natural<00:04:30.700> expansion<00:04:31.000> he

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
easier to hold that natural expansion he

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.240 
easier to hold that natural expansion he
put<00:04:31.540> down<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> bunker<00:04:32.230> but<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.950> bunker<00:04:33.220> a

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
put down the bunker but that bunker a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.180 
put down the bunker but that bunker a
lot<00:04:33.580> closer<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.320> choke<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.740> time<00:04:36.010> around

it's<00:04:36.580> going<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.760> be<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> lot<00:04:37.060> more<00:04:37.120> difficult<00:04:37.570> to

game<00:05:39.630> which<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.870> go<00:05:40.990> for<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.200> scan<00:05:41.470> first<00:05:41.800> and

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
game which is to go for a scan first and

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.590 
game which is to go for a scan first and
then<00:05:42.160> eventually<00:05:42.250> get<00:05:42.820> turrets<00:05:43.150> up<00:05:43.360> if<00:05:43.540> he

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
then eventually get turrets up if he

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.330 
then eventually get turrets up if he
needs<00:05:44.229> them<00:05:44.470> so<00:05:44.650> he's<00:05:44.800> going<00:05:44.889> to<00:05:44.979> scan<00:05:45.190> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
needs them so he's going to scan the

needs them so he's going to scan the
bases<00:05:45.669> first<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:47.020> is<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.169> lot<00:05:47.380> like<00:05:47.560> flash

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
what he used to do throw down two scans

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.620 
what he used to do throw down two scans
scan<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.460> main<00:05:54.729> and<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.060> natural<00:05:55.180> expansion

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
scan the main and the natural expansion

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.020 
scan the main and the natural expansion
and<00:05:56.050> catch<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:56.860> building<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.520> comes<00:05:57.850> up

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
and catch that building that comes up

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.200

there's<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.169> scan<00:05:59.440> catching<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> spire<00:06:00.669> so

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
there's the scan catching the spire so

his plus-one attack is being researched

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.090 
his plus-one attack is being researched
trying<00:07:22.120> to<00:07:22.300> find<00:07:22.540> that<00:07:22.780> third-base<00:07:23.080> he<00:07:23.710> kind

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
trying to find that third-base he kind

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.590 
trying to find that third-base he kind
of<00:07:24.250> guessed<00:07:24.760> that<00:07:24.910> it<00:07:25.030> would<00:07:25.120> be<00:07:25.270> down<00:07:25.480> the

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600 
of guessed that it would be down the

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.240 
of guessed that it would be down the
five<00:07:25.780> o'clock<00:07:25.990> position<00:07:26.470> that's<00:07:26.710> why<00:07:26.890> scan

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
five o'clock position that's why scan

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.030 
five o'clock position that's why scan
down<00:07:27.430> there<00:07:28.260> so<00:07:29.260> now<00:07:29.410> I<00:07:29.440> think<00:07:29.710> he's<00:07:29.800> going<00:07:29.980> to

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
down there so now I think he's going to

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.190 
down there so now I think he's going to
make<00:07:30.130> his<00:07:30.400> way<00:07:30.610> to<00:07:30.640> the<00:07:30.910> other<00:07:31.240> corner<00:07:31.810> and

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200 
make his way to the other corner and

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.560 
make his way to the other corner and
flying<00:07:32.590> that<00:07:33.040> third<00:07:33.430> base<00:07:33.730> looks<00:07:34.330> like<00:07:34.450> he's

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
flying that third base looks like he's

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.030 
flying that third base looks like he's
going<00:07:34.720> oh<00:07:35.140> I<00:07:35.500> thought<00:07:35.650> I<00:07:35.680> was<00:07:35.770> going<00:07:35.860> to<00:07:35.950> go
