00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.679
 welcome we are on the product manufacturing site 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.109
 the aircraft manufacturer we got to fly over a few kilometers from 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.980
 punta allen in brittany and it's since the beginning of the 80's 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 we will learn more 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.690
 What do you think 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.060
 los angeles then you are director of this site as people are working 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.530
 right here 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.390
 currently there are fifty people working on the site which in 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.470
 makes a site 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.060
 artisanal and industrial 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.370
 actually handcrafted by the industrial size for the processes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.050
 used 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.500
 you manufacture if organic products since the early 80s well 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 before we talk about why 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.290
 but we are a cooperative structure our goal is to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.470
 valorize the producers' milk 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.710
 and quite naturally some of our producers however geared towards the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 organic production method we are keen to promote those linked to 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.620
 better by turning it into dairy products made on the site then 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.820
 your raw material is 100% French organic milk 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.650
 would say even more 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.930
 100% Breton 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.840
 100% Breton yes since we collect on the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.040
 the three departments of Brittany pointe finistÃ¨re morbihan and 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.659
 ribs-d'armor talking about the products you make here 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.659
 What are the specific actions of organic production? 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.980
 none of our producers have produced this milk in a natural healthy way in 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.390
 respecting the environment 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.680
 and in the same way we respect 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 of these criteria 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 using quality organic fruit ingredients for example the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.610
 organic cane sugar also 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.810
 of course no additives, preservatives or dyes 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.999
 we are on a site certified to pay 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.040
 e what are the nights you have to bring the environment 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.010
 we try to limit our water consumption 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.640
 of course we sort our waste and we also use 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 cleaning products that are not harmful to humans 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.449
 a character we saw the making of dessert cream at 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.679
 chocolate and yogurt brewed neighborhood 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.389
 I guess I do not accept it to happen again 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.249
 of the factory four families of products 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.249
 plain white cheese we will follow 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.270
 but also 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.769
 we get back 11 tons of yoghurt or kill them 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.629
 cream also chocolate and vanilla dessert creams 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.569
 then we will end with a detail that is important 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 dionne was part of the association produced in brittany why 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.370
 the association produces in brittany for the purpose of promoting the products 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.989
 breton and develop employment in Brittany the objectives of the aircraft carrier 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 was naturally we have every interest in this association 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.299
 it's good war here you are you on organic products nature 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.589
