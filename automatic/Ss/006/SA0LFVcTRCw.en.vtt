00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.870
 yes friends on youtube I show droid 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.700
 and gym I'm watching to teach how to put 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.880
 textures in minecraft because it says a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.170
 0.12 point 1 any guild and then 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.060
 good without block launcher obviously 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.230
 because there is no manage to be even but good 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.210
 this tutorial and of the fact many times 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
 in the 0.9 nation point our point 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.359
 11 and well I'll do it once 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 more because there are a lot of new people that 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.539
 I think they did not find it or something 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.920
 well and they were asking a lot 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 this matter they passed the video but 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.890
 they say they did not understand and so well 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.870
 in this life it is the same basically 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.239
 let's use as proof what is the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.520
 tics and sporty texture the cirque to him 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.320
 and good indeed the first texture that 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.969
 they exported for knitting 2 is 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.290
 great and we have here what is the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.230
 Apply that I left on Facebook 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.170
 basically the apec rush of the 0.12 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.520
 point 1 built 3 and well as he 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.570
 said it works with any build not 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.039
 matter the since it is had this 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.300
 video game to work then let's 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.969
 do this first of all let's go to 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 rename what the Aztec is 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.699
 minecraft let's rename well 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.409
 because he can only extract 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.850
 perfectly with a if you put file 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.320
 Explorer also what the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.750
 very good file viewing instruction 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 which serves perfectly for those things 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.590
 and well let's extract first that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.210
 nothing all that is minecraft here is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.659
 all minecraft files lousame 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.700
 in extract ok we hope I'll explain it very 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.080
 slow and tutorial so there's no 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.990
 no problem they say I speak 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.040
 fast etcetera here is on camera 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 slow 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.550
 here we have what is the German apec 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.080
 that I had unpacked are all 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 minecraft files after we go to 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 use what it is to decompress the cirque of 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 the texture you already know that the textures 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.240
 always always almost always we are in 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440
 zip we are going to give you in extract ok 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.300
 we hope it's a little heavy weighed 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.280
 a little bit almost the same as minecraft 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.960
 we go here once we have the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.870
 texture all that is the folder 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.970
 called assets we are going to give you in cutting 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.580
 as if the tutorial folder we are going to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.110
 go to the minecraft folder with all 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.390
 Minecraft files and we will give 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 in pasting he will ask us if we want 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.920
 overwrite you have to give it yes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.240
 because this is going to make me over write 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.830
 the texture files in the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.600
 minecraft files and so will 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.520
 replace the texture of minecraft war 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.960
 pixie texture you have to wait a little bit 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.340
 Suddenly it also takes time depends on your 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.410
 device let's wait a little bit more 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.330
 It's taking a long time 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.800
 wait a little longer wait for a 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.180
 When you finish this process we will 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 to hide it but that is taking 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.349
 too hide once it ends 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.849
 The whole process is ending 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.580
 copy the texture files inside 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.870
 from minecraft let's make abraham this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.150
 we select all the files that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.400
 they're here 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.700
 we all select it and we're going 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.530
 to give in compressing 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.530
 let's put this 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.780
 texture pixie apk the name they want 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.890
 put not care and let's see what 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.720
 you also have to wait for it 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.640
 Compress tar too depends on your 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.230
 device takes something depends too 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.730
 the texture is very large there are textures 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.310
 very large that if they take a long time 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.930
 compress but when it's compressed we go 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.520
 to continue once it has already 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.900
 compressed let's do this we 're going to 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.850
 rename apec again to rename it 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.850
 we are going to give to sin 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.880
 once it's already become the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.220
 been certain application this application 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.990
 it's called fix ainia allows us to sign 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.820
 freckles to install them though 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.290
 are modified since if you 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.060
 Poser want to be just 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.610
 create moments is not going to install 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.680
 we have to go to cnr and choose entry 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.000
 here this button that is up once 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.830
 that they are going to go to the folder 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.950
 where we have our plate that we just 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.110
 to create that in my case is in the folder 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.170
 from minecraft and I put my texture apk 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.850
 pixie apk we will select it once 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.030
 that we selected it, we are going to take 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.270
 kmart let's choose what is average and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.220
 let's give it in sign the file there 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.320
 to wait for him to sign it is also a 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990
 little time depends on the size of the 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.490
 He is ready, he is signing it once 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.530
 I finished signing the apk we are going to 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.120
 have two apk the first one that we did that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.010
 obviously we can not install and the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.960
 second apk that is the one that is signed 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.240
 says signet that means signed in 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.220
 English is not that you have the signature signed 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.870
 simply because they install it and as 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.209
 they signed it with chips before installing 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.310
 without any problem and they will be able to 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.870
 Enjoy your texture freely in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.920
 minecraft can do it with any 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.690
 texture and the end 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.340
 because the two have enough textures 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.410
 on my other channel these days that are 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.360
 being very pretty including up to 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 that I already brought them or indirectly 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.870
 this video so also the video of 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.310
 cadillac and everything so I left it in the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.500
 description if you like to download your 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.330
 texture here is pixie is amazing to 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.920
 him if you see this a giant hug is 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.280
 incredible texture and then we are going to 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.689
 enter here here we are going to enter 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.669
 same for textures that is a suv 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.539
 and here is how you can see the texture 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.899
 pixie in all its splendor in its 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.779
 splendor looks incredible and therefore being 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:05:01.029
 chosen great here and that's how it 's like 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.909
 they install any texture in any case 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:07.509
 that some youtuber has given them some 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.189
 texture either in apk they will do 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.559
 the same procedure or you see that 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.269
 lately, textures are coming out 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:15.219
 and then in the case of falling he gave them what 

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:16.899
 He sins and the sip can also be 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.789
 the texture of the freckle simply opens 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.679
 He sins when he shows them and they take the 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.869
 assets folder and copy it to your new 

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:24.849
 apk and you can do it with 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:27.729
 any wheel if for example they have 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.339
 a freckle with the pixie texture of the will 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.519
 1 of the will 2 are simply going to extract 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:34.959
 what is the content since it is applied 

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.729
 makes it the extra cycle in the 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:38.589
 folder to make the copy to your new 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.300
 minecraft and they recreate their own 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.709
 He sins from the newest website then very 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.659
 easy to do all this is that it has 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.369
 I explain served in each version 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.379
 because I think a lot of people are coming 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:48.939
 new to the channel that gives me great pleasure and 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.289
 Well, I hope I have clarified that they are 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.200
 your doubts well how beautiful it looks 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.330
 ocelots hello peking

 This texture is very beautiful to leave in the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.290
 rock in the inscription and then obviously 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.060
 also the download of the programs 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.630
 necessary that if tyler is fail explorer 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.810
 and if less than at the end discuss what their 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.070
 favorite mode of the 0.2 and comment that 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.540
 they saw it at the end so you know what 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.390
 they saw everything in the paintings how pretty 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.830
 they are and so good people with this would be 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.960
 everything for this video now yes I hope 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.580

 doubt they have will be answering the 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.000
 I will leave the description other tutorials 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.310
 to be able to change what is the language 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.810
 the files like for example the portal 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.700
 and other things that want to change 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.190
 They can also change perfectly with 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.750
 this tutorial and well this tutorial is 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.060
 more extensive because in this he believes in 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.950
 change what is the language and taught them 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.870
 how to have two versions of minecraft to 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.550
 the time then it is very cool what 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.530
 I will leave in the description also for 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.480
 who likes and for my part that offered 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.950
 all for this video a giant hug will 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.890
 they take care 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.890
 I hoped he solved his doubts and went down
