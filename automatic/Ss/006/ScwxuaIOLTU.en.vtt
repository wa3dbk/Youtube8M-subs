00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.390
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.730
 agriculture practice tip today we will get in touch 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.289
 from the southeastern styria has here 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.060
 the corn rootworm in recent years 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.130
 years visible damage done 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.370
 mainly in the form of bent over 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.610
 maize plants in four years may now 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.110
 only three times corn are grown 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.420
 Now for the first time in this 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 make an attempt to biological 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.490
 combating the corn rootworm 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.400
 doing this brings you certain 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.140
 nematodes with the seed out and placed 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720
 right in the soul 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.570
 the nematodes infest the larvae of the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.850
 corn rootworm and kick it off 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.580
 us is the lichtenberg from the company in 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.050
 who produces the nematodes mr 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 lichtenberg how can we get the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.189
 effectively consisted of nematodes in corn 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.929
 imagine yes it is a special one 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.119
 methods art as they call also timo 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.740
 pathogenic nematodes they invade 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.479
 host animals and set a there 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.369
 bacterium which in itself carry free 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.249
 and about it becomes practically larvae 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.509
 killed the corn rootworm 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:22.719
 In addition, the nematodes 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.520
 only in the larvae can live in 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.159
 To increase the load you have one 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.749
 its building efficiency is called 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.579
 the data please multiply 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.020
 bring out and settle the new store 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.929
 is therefore an efficiency of the over 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.780
 time increases how are the nematodes 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.990
 Yes applied very special technology 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.790
 developed 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.680
 Base is actually the phytosanitary 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.570
 technology with a plant protection almost 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.159
 corresponding pump and then we have 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 special years so they developed 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.960
 never methods directly because the open 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.330
 side to the pressed on complicated 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.280
 will be the application of nematodes 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.420
 in most cases allowed in Austria 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.770
 we are certified 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.899
 pesticides means who wants 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.460
 can use in the methods and completely 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.380
 work with it regularly how does it look 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.720
 in germany in the area 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.909
 Admission is so that amazon to 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.530
 Organic cells are called none 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.360
 approval is required as well as who can 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.880
 wants to use these methods without 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.060
 Many thanks for the conversation 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.350
 dr hermann strasser is also with us 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.630
 the university of innsbruck 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.080
 mister dr street how will the attempt 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.019
 we have created here in the context of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.269
 eu-project impact attempts planned 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.299
 where we have different biological 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.130
 pesticides as a single 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.640
 But it is also an active ingredient, so to speak 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.440
 the new approach to yours 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.870
 synergy effects to test together 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.640
 try out and then do as well 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.769
 combinations that we will then 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.630
 Effectively increasing substances with in 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.519
 bring in the soil accordingly 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.200
 a good hopefully of the booking 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.280
 effective photos against the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.440
 to have corn rootworm 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.690
 from when is with first results too 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.160
 So count on our first 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.690
 results we expect if we do that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.970
 project to complete that is that with 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.959
 2015 should be the entire study 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.329
 be completed 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.200
 but of course, expect already 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.239
 end of year 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.609
 Say, if we already harvest the first 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.280
 enter in the course of the pony tour only the 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.620
 hints to what extent which products too 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.450
 Favors are how do you judge the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.040
 situation of the corncob drill finger 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.959
 strongly 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.500
 The corn rootworm pressure is immense 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.329
 large 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.290
 you only need more or less board 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.950
 wants to cross the Slovenian border 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.840
 watch 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.549
 There it would be said that way 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.100
 Plant protection measures for corn 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.630
 No insecticides could be prohibited 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.549
 Example be used and the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.540
 palaces hurt so immensely over 60 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.329
 percent what I've heard 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.609
 that means we are really in 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.470
 a hotspot to areas say so 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.090
 would like to be in a nuclear zone at the moment where 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.500
 she really now this 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.690
 graph dramatically evolved 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.209
 has and it is understandable that it is 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.510
 now here together both the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.640
 So research was 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.049
 of course, the various representatives 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.030
 organizations that can black for a long time 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.379
 one is very active here and the problem 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.590
 to stop 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.260
 what do you expect me to try? 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.140
 expect me as a biologist that we are very 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.870
 probably an integrated stream of 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.640
 bring fighting concluded that we so 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.260
 not only now where the existing 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640
 obviously see but in 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.680
 later follow this too 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.100
 future epidemic areas already 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.410
 maybe prophylactic 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.910
 I thank you for the conversation in 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.580
 dear spectators still wish much 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.470
 success in the outstanding we mastered 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.240
 Report back from this experiment 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.110
 late summer when the first results 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.800
 be present 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800
 until then
