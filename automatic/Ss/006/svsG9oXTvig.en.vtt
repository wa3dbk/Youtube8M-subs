Sona<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.090> these<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.510> two<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.809> these

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Sona now these are two of these

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
Sona now these are two of these
strongest<00:00:37.559> lanes<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> game<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.640> obvious

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
strongest lanes in the game for obvious

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
strongest lanes in the game for obvious
reasons<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.329> mean<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.600> tarik<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.050> incredible

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
reasons I mean as tarik has incredible

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
reasons I mean as tarik has incredible
burst<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.160> does<00:00:41.219> MF<00:00:41.579> Sona<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
burst but then so does MF Sona so it's a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.150 
burst but then so does MF Sona so it's a
really<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.739> tough<00:00:43.800> line

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
really it's really really tough line

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.029 
really it's really really tough line
because<00:00:44.460> both<00:00:44.700> lanes<00:00:45.030> have<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.600> easy<00:00:45.930> easy<00:00:46.710> /

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because both lanes have that easy easy /

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.690 
because both lanes have that easy easy /
um<00:00:47.300> way<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.809> pressure<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.700> tarick's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

because<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.150> Pauline<00:03:04.480> has<00:03:04.600> no<00:03:04.780> wards<00:03:05.110> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
because this Pauline has no wards and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.320 
because this Pauline has no wards and
they<00:03:05.290> are<00:03:05.380> pushed<00:03:05.590> up<00:03:05.680> way<00:03:06.010> way<00:03:06.310> too<00:03:06.340> far<00:03:06.700> but

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
they are pushed up way way too far but

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.699 
they are pushed up way way too far but
like<00:03:08.020> I<00:03:08.110> was<00:03:08.230> talking<00:03:08.380> about<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:08.590> they're

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
like I was talking about what they're

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.380 
like I was talking about what they're
all<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:09.190> tark<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.700> Israel<00:03:10.120> they're<00:03:10.240> all

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
all in there tark in Israel they're all

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.670 
all in there tark in Israel they're all
in<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.750> lot<00:03:11.110> higher<00:03:11.320> damage<00:03:11.620> potential<00:03:12.130> then

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
in is a lot higher damage potential then

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.199 
in is a lot higher damage potential then
then<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.800> MF<00:03:15.070> Sona<00:03:15.310> now<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.790> don't<00:03:16.000> know<00:03:16.060> what

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
then the MF Sona now I don't know what

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.190 
then the MF Sona now I don't know what
this<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.600> doing<00:03:16.870> he's<00:03:16.989> over

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
this is really doing he's over

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
this is really doing he's over
definitely<00:03:17.920> overextending<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:20.290> Nocturne<00:03:21.070> is

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
definitely overextending but Nocturne is

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.800 
definitely overextending but Nocturne is
not<00:03:21.400> going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> go<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.030> they're<00:03:22.540> waiting

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
not going to go in on it they're waiting

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.160 
not going to go in on it they're waiting
for<00:03:22.989> Sona<00:03:23.230> now<00:03:24.130> they<00:03:24.400> still<00:03:24.640> no<00:03:24.880> wards<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.810> I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
for Sona now they still no wards so I

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.500 
for Sona now they still no wards so I
mean<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:26.950> still<00:03:27.250> an<00:03:27.370> easy<00:03:27.640> easy<00:03:28.000> kill<00:03:28.330> for

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
mean this is still an easy easy kill for

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.660 
mean this is still an easy easy kill for
this<00:03:28.570> Nocturne<00:03:28.959> he<00:03:29.680> does<00:03:29.890> not<00:03:30.190> have<00:03:30.580> his

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
this Nocturne he does not have his

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.280 
this Nocturne he does not have his
ultimate<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.209> like<00:03:31.420> another<00:03:31.600> five<00:03:31.840> seconds<00:03:32.200> I

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
ultimate for like another five seconds I

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.270 
ultimate for like another five seconds I
guess<00:03:32.410> that's<00:03:32.590> what<00:03:32.680> he's<00:03:32.769> waiting<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.070> and

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
guess that's what he's waiting on and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.620 
guess that's what he's waiting on and
now<00:03:33.370> he's<00:03:33.550> gonna<00:03:33.640> go<00:03:33.820> in<00:03:33.940> for<00:03:33.970> sure<00:03:34.390> right

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
now he's gonna go in for sure right

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.550 
now he's gonna go in for sure right
about<00:03:34.840> now<00:03:37.830> almost<00:03:38.830> garnish<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.459> counter

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
about now almost garnish here to counter

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.509 
about now almost garnish here to counter
so<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:41.680> beam<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.040> will<00:03:42.190> be<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> good<00:03:42.370> team

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
so this beam this will be a good team

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.740 
so this beam this will be a good team
fight<00:03:42.670> now<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.820> focus<00:03:43.000> out<00:03:43.209> skarner<00:03:43.480> really

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
fight now the focus out skarner really

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.150 
fight now the focus out skarner really
really<00:03:44.080> quickly<00:03:44.290> mocked<00:03:44.620> Nocturne<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.130> a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
really quickly mocked Nocturne just a

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.270 
really quickly mocked Nocturne just a
lot<00:03:45.489> more<00:03:45.700> big<00:03:45.880> than<00:03:45.910> on<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.830> scar<00:03:48.070> on<00:03:48.100> his

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
lot more big than on that scar on his

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.770 
lot more big than on that scar on his
holy<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.150> was<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.269> lot<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.450> burst<00:03:49.630> damage

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
holy that was a lot of burst damage

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.949 
holy that was a lot of burst damage
so<00:03:50.470> Nocturne<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.370> running<00:03:51.850> what<00:03:52.660> does<00:03:52.750> he<00:03:52.840> have

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
so Nocturne is running what does he have

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.860 
so Nocturne is running what does he have
that's<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> new<00:03:53.470> item<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.760> he<00:03:55.720> already

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
that's the new item it is the he already

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.500 
that's the new item it is the he already
has<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.080> huge<00:03:56.709> huge<00:03:57.040> amount<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.430> damage<00:03:57.670> because

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
has a huge huge amount of damage because

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.270 
has a huge huge amount of damage because
of<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.810> what<00:03:59.380> does<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.590> item<00:03:59.769> called<00:03:59.920> spirit

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
of the what does that item called spirit

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.620 
of the what does that item called spirit
of<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.400> lizard<00:04:00.519> elder<00:04:00.880> which<00:04:01.090> effectively

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
of the lizard elder which effectively

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.949 
of the lizard elder which effectively
gets<00:04:01.870> him<00:04:01.959> like<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.110> red<00:04:02.320> buff<00:04:03.600> but<00:04:04.600> it's<00:04:04.720> it's

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
gets him like a red buff but it's it's

gets him like a red buff but it's it's
true<00:04:05.140> damage<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.560> he<00:04:05.650> also<00:04:05.800> does<00:04:06.010> twenty-five

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
true damage and he also does twenty-five

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.710 
true damage and he also does twenty-five
percent<00:04:06.430> increase<00:04:06.820> damage<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.209> minions<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:07.600> he

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
percent increase damage to minions so he

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.720 
percent increase damage to minions so he
clear<00:04:07.900> she<00:04:08.019> was<00:04:08.110> jungle<00:04:08.410> camps<00:04:08.650> really<00:04:09.310> really

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
clear she was jungle camps really really

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.090 
clear she was jungle camps really really
quickly<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.470> scarna<00:04:11.470> just<00:04:11.739> hasn't<00:04:12.010> quite

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
quickly and scarna just hasn't quite

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.560 
quickly and scarna just hasn't quite
finished<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.580> build<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:13.000> on<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.450> item

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
finished that build that on that item

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.190 
finished that build that on that item
yet<00:04:14.519> but<00:04:15.519> there<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.479> lot<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.989> plane

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
yet but there this lot this plane

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.599 
yet but there this lot this plane
matchup<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.709> really<00:04:18.040> really<00:04:18.160> tough<00:04:18.400> for<00:04:18.430> both

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
matchup is really really tough for both

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.279 
matchup is really really tough for both
sides<00:04:18.910> because<00:04:19.209> if<00:04:19.570> they<00:04:19.810> get<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.080> early

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
sides because if they get that early

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:21.479 
sides because if they get that early
advantage<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.739> early<00:04:20.979> pressure<00:04:21.130> from<00:04:21.400> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
advantage that early pressure from the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.070 
advantage that early pressure from the
jungler<00:04:21.789> as<00:04:22.510> she<00:04:22.630> was<00:04:22.750> going<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.930> try<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
jungler as she was going to try and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.160 
jungler as she was going to try and
steal<00:04:23.289> dragon<00:04:23.590> here

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
steal dragon here

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.650 
steal dragon here
and<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:25.100> don't<00:04:25.730> think<00:04:25.910> he<00:04:26.060> does<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.450> little

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
and I don't think he does now a little

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.090 
and I don't think he does now a little
too<00:04:26.840> early<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.230> they<00:04:27.260> get<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.470> format<00:04:27.800> dragon

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
too early so they get a format dragon

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.820 
too early so they get a format dragon
they<00:04:28.190> pick<00:04:28.340> up<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.550> dragon<00:04:28.880> no<00:04:28.970> problem<00:04:29.830> but

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
they pick up that dragon no problem but

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.890 
they pick up that dragon no problem but
the<00:04:30.920> thing<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.070> Israel<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.030> Tareq<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.660> if

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
the thing is Israel and Tareq like if

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.660 
the thing is Israel and Tareq like if
they<00:04:33.080> go<00:04:33.110> all-in<00:04:33.380> they<00:04:33.590> can<00:04:33.770> kill<00:04:33.920> Sona<00:04:34.160> really

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
they go all-in they can kill Sona really

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.740 
they go all-in they can kill Sona really
really<00:04:34.850> quickly<00:04:35.000> because<00:04:35.150> she's<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:35.630> much

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
really quickly because she's so much

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.810 
really quickly because she's so much
question<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.230> tark<00:04:36.410> where<00:04:37.190> as<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.580> can<00:04:37.700> see

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
question and tark where as you can see

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.550 
question and tark where as you can see
they're<00:04:37.940> like<00:04:38.030> Sona<00:04:38.660> did<00:04:38.870> all<00:04:39.020> set<00:04:39.230> both<00:04:39.410> of

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
they're like Sona did all set both of

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.800 
they're like Sona did all set both of
them<00:04:39.680> but<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.490> damage<00:04:40.820> from<00:04:40.850> MF<00:04:41.300> zone<00:04:41.480> is<00:04:41.630> more

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
them but the damage from MF zone is more

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.480 
them but the damage from MF zone is more
poke<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.530> more<00:04:42.650> sustained<00:04:43.040> damage<00:04:43.310> well

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
poke it's more sustained damage well

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
poke it's more sustained damage well
versus<00:04:43.790> where<00:04:43.970> Tareq<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.510> Israel<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.050> they<00:04:45.140> go

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
versus where Tareq and Israel if they go

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.810 
versus where Tareq and Israel if they go
all<00:04:45.500> in<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.800> they<00:04:45.890> blow<00:04:46.100> everything<00:04:46.310> they<00:04:46.760> can

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
all in and they blow everything they can

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.550 
all in and they blow everything they can
do<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.030> lot<00:04:47.330> more<00:04:47.360> damage<00:04:47.660> like<00:04:48.170> all<00:04:48.380> at<00:04:48.530> once

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
do a lot more damage like all at once

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.250 
do a lot more damage like all at once
that's<00:04:49.280> considered<00:04:49.880> all<00:04:50.000> in<00:04:50.030> obviously<00:04:50.510> so

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
that's considered all in obviously so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.170 
that's considered all in obviously so
it's<00:04:51.500> really<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.800> tough<00:04:52.160> matchup<00:04:52.400> for<00:04:52.790> both

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
it's really a tough matchup for both

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.280 
it's really a tough matchup for both
sides<00:04:53.360> depending<00:04:53.540> on<00:04:53.810> like<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:54.020> said<00:04:54.170> like

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
sides depending on like I said like

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.930 
sides depending on like I said like
their<00:04:54.560> early<00:04:54.860> jungle<00:04:55.160> pressure<00:04:55.370> now<00:04:55.610> they're

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
their early jungle pressure now they're

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.760 
their early jungle pressure now they're
about<00:04:56.090> even<00:04:56.420> in<00:04:56.540> Lane<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:56.870> MF<00:04:57.200> definitely<00:04:57.590> is

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
about even in Lane but MF definitely is

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.040 
about even in Lane but MF definitely is
ahead<00:04:58.010> now<00:04:58.190> after<00:04:58.490> that<00:04:58.580> um<00:04:58.820> they've<00:04:59.780> gotten

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
ahead now after that um they've gotten

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.300 
ahead now after that um they've gotten
more<00:05:00.170> kills<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.560> they<00:05:00.620> just<00:05:00.770> got<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.890> dragon<00:05:01.220> so

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
more kills and they just got a dragon so

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.450 
more kills and they just got a dragon so
as<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.460> getting<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.700> see<00:05:03.010> their<00:05:04.010> damage<00:05:04.310> is

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
as you getting to see their damage is

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.800 
as you getting to see their damage is
ridiculous<00:05:04.940> now<00:05:05.030> someone<00:05:05.480> up<00:05:05.600> or<00:05:05.720> I'll

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
ridiculous now someone up or I'll

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.540 
ridiculous now someone up or I'll
see<00:05:05.930> their<00:05:06.050> tried<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:06.350> catch<00:05:06.530> Israel<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.280> just

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
see their tried to catch Israel and just

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.150 
see their tried to catch Israel and just
definitely<00:05:07.850> did<00:05:08.030> not<00:05:08.060> manage<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.630> do<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
definitely did not manage to do so so

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.240 
definitely did not manage to do so so
they're<00:05:10.160> gonna<00:05:10.250> get<00:05:10.430> nothing<00:05:11.060> from<00:05:11.150> that<00:05:12.250> so

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
they're gonna get nothing from that so

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
they're gonna get nothing from that so
like<00:05:13.580> basically<00:05:13.760> what<00:05:14.180> Azrael<00:05:14.570> and<00:05:14.690> tark<00:05:15.110> want

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
like basically what Azrael and tark want

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.010 
like basically what Azrael and tark want
to<00:05:15.440> do<00:05:15.560> is<00:05:15.740> just<00:05:15.770> try<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.420> try<00:05:17.420> and<00:05:17.450> shut<00:05:17.810> down

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
to do is just try and try and shut down

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.640 
to do is just try and try and shut down
MF<00:05:18.350> as<00:05:18.530> much<00:05:18.680> as<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.920> can<00:05:18.980> like<00:05:19.690> their<00:05:20.690> MF<00:05:21.500> is

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
MF as much as I can like their MF is

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.320 
MF as much as I can like their MF is
getting<00:05:21.920> pretty<00:05:22.070> farmed<00:05:22.520> she<00:05:23.000> already<00:05:23.120> has

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
getting pretty farmed she already has

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.400 
getting pretty farmed she already has
three<00:05:23.600> assists<00:05:23.870> she<00:05:23.990> hasn't<00:05:24.200> gotten<00:05:24.320> any

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
three assists she hasn't gotten any

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.690 
three assists she hasn't gotten any
kills<00:05:24.740> which<00:05:24.920> is<00:05:25.040> really<00:05:25.250> good<00:05:25.430> for<00:05:25.580> their

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
kills which is really good for their

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.700 
kills which is really good for their
team<00:05:25.850> but<00:05:26.330> Nocturne<00:05:26.870> has<00:05:27.170> gotten<00:05:27.470> a<00:05:27.500> lot<00:05:27.560> of

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
team but Nocturne has gotten a lot of

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.710 
team but Nocturne has gotten a lot of
kills<00:05:27.860> so<00:05:27.980> he's<00:05:28.160> really<00:05:28.430> really<00:05:28.730> big<00:05:28.910> azrael

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
kills so he's really really big azrael

kills so he's really really big azrael
is<00:05:29.750> getting<00:05:30.020> LCS<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.410> little<00:05:30.680> bit<00:05:30.800> now<00:05:31.010> it's<00:05:31.130> a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
is getting LCS a little bit now it's a

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.140 
is getting LCS a little bit now it's a
good<00:05:31.310> buy<00:05:31.430> for<00:05:31.460> him<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.910> get<00:05:32.030> the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
good buy for him to get the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.520 
good buy for him to get the
bloodthirster<00:05:32.600> because<00:05:32.870> typically<00:05:33.170> you<00:05:33.350> buy

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
bloodthirster because typically you buy

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.280 
bloodthirster because typically you buy
a<00:05:33.560> bloodthirster<00:05:34.100> if<00:05:34.280> you're<00:05:34.430> behind<00:05:34.760> in<00:05:34.940> lane

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
a bloodthirster if you're behind in lane

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.510 
a bloodthirster if you're behind in lane
or<00:05:36.290> if<00:05:36.530> you're<00:05:36.620> just<00:05:36.650> gonna<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:36.920> a<00:05:37.070> farm<00:05:37.370> lane

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
or if you're just gonna have a farm lane

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.620 
or if you're just gonna have a farm lane
and<00:05:37.670> if<00:05:37.820> they're<00:05:37.940> pushing<00:05:38.240> out<00:05:38.330> this<00:05:38.450> hurt

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
and if they're pushing out this hurt

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.830 
and if they're pushing out this hurt
then<00:05:38.840> for<00:05:39.050> sure<00:05:39.080> he's<00:05:39.410> gonna<00:05:39.560> have<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:40.840> he's

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
then for sure he's gonna have a he's

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.900 
then for sure he's gonna have a he's
gonna<00:05:41.960> try<00:05:42.200> and<00:05:42.320> stall<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:42.650> out<00:05:42.820> now<00:05:43.820> that

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
gonna try and stall it out now that

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.430 
gonna try and stall it out now that
basically<00:05:44.240> ends<00:05:44.540> the<00:05:44.600> laning<00:05:44.870> phase<00:05:45.020> now<00:05:45.230> they

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
basically ends the laning phase now they

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.440 
basically ends the laning phase now they
got<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.710> turret<00:05:46.010> Asriel's<00:05:47.000> probably<00:05:47.300> just

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
got that turret Asriel's probably just

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.000 
got that turret Asriel's probably just
she<00:05:47.780> should<00:05:48.020> be<00:05:48.140> just<00:05:48.320> stalling<00:05:48.560> this<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:48.950> don't

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
she should be just stalling this I don't

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.490 
she should be just stalling this I don't
really<00:05:49.250> know<00:05:49.460> why<00:05:49.640> he's<00:05:49.790> Auto<00:05:50.540> attacking<00:05:50.870> but

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
really know why he's Auto attacking but

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.170 
really know why he's Auto attacking but
ideally<00:05:52.160> right<00:05:52.310> now<00:05:52.430> he'd<00:05:52.610> be<00:05:52.730> stalling<00:05:52.970> this

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
ideally right now he'd be stalling this

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.520 
ideally right now he'd be stalling this
because<00:05:53.450> now<00:05:53.570> he<00:05:53.630> has<00:05:53.810> free<00:05:54.020> farm<00:05:54.230> for<00:05:54.410> days

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
because now he has free farm for days

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.990 
because now he has free farm for days
but<00:05:54.560> he's<00:05:54.890> just<00:05:55.010> gonna<00:05:55.160> push<00:05:55.370> this<00:05:55.520> out<00:05:55.670> for

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
but he's just gonna push this out for

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.110 
but he's just gonna push this out for
who<00:05:56.480> knows<00:05:56.660> whatever<00:05:56.900> reason<00:05:57.910> hey<00:05:58.910> guys

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
who knows whatever reason hey guys

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.760 
who knows whatever reason hey guys
that's<00:05:59.240> basically<00:05:59.540> my<00:05:59.660> analysis<00:06:00.350> of<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
that's basically my analysis of the

Azrael taarak vs sona MF like I said

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.180 
Azrael taarak vs sona MF like I said
like<00:06:06.110> one<00:06:06.350> of<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.500> toughest<00:06:06.770> lanes<00:06:07.010> and

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
like one of the toughest lanes and

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.190 
like one of the toughest lanes and
really<00:06:07.580> really<00:06:07.910> depends<00:06:08.300> on<00:06:08.420> who<00:06:08.870> gets<00:06:09.020> the

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
really really depends on who gets the

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.180 
really really depends on who gets the
early<00:06:09.410> game<00:06:09.530> pressure<00:06:09.770> because<00:06:10.040> they're

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
early game pressure because they're

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.590 
early game pressure because they're
pretty<00:06:10.400> even<00:06:10.700> in<00:06:10.820> lanes<00:06:11.000> they<00:06:11.150> both<00:06:11.330> have<00:06:11.510> that

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
pretty even in lanes they both have that

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.850 
pretty even in lanes they both have that
incredible<00:06:11.720> burst<00:06:12.230> potential<00:06:12.650> they<00:06:12.710> both

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
incredible burst potential they both

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.710 
incredible burst potential they both
have<00:06:13.040> good<00:06:13.280> sustain<00:06:13.730> and<00:06:13.940> they<00:06:14.300> both<00:06:14.450> have<00:06:14.600> the

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
have good sustain and they both have the

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.020 
have good sustain and they both have the
extra<00:06:14.930> damage<00:06:15.080> so<00:06:15.440> that<00:06:16.040> is<00:06:16.160> one<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.580> most

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
extra damage so that is one of the most

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.640
