street tires and the suspension and so

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.429 
street tires and the suspension and so
on<00:03:09.950> but<00:03:10.280> you'll<00:03:11.180> probably<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> bit<00:03:12.230> less

tread on your tires and then you

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.119
