00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.320

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.470
 the description of this video below 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 you have the website where you can see 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.820
 the prices and delivery times and a 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.619
 once we have the release code 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.930
 what we have to do to free it 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 is to put a sim card of another 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.699
 operator in this case we have a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.129
 sort of the vodafone company so 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.610
 we are going to put a micro sim card 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.610
 of propofol 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.050
 we face the terminal 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.750
 this method is totally safe not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.670
 causes any type of failure in the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 guarantee not valid and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.750
 does not save any data either 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.980
 when you turn it on, the first thing that I would ask you 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.900
 is the pin code of the card if in 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.040
 if it had in this case we have 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.780
 put a card that does not carry 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.160
 pin code activation so 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.230
 directly will jump the next 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.760
 step in the case that yours if you 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.040
 have the first thing I would ask you would be the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.720
 pin code of the card and the following 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.240
 it would be this screen that you see that puts the 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.710
 unlock pin network card if not 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.000
 it is the pin of the card what is there 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.510
 put here that puts the code of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.510
 release 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.770
 click on the white square to 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.330
 open the keyboard and we mark the code of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.190
 logically release this code that 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.660
 I'm going to put alone serves to release this 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.990
 phone every phone carries a code 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.990
 different 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.360
 Once the code is marked, click on 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.880
 to unlock 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.440
 like them through the unlocked network and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.540
 Now, well, go to the screen 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.550
 configuration and the phone is already 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.550
 ready to use with any operator
