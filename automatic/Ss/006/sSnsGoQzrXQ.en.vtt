crucial<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:21.240> avoid<00:01:22.040> catabolism<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
crucial that we avoid catabolism and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
crucial that we avoid catabolism and
maximize<00:01:24.619> anabolism<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.909> know<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
maximize anabolism so we all know that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.289 
maximize anabolism so we all know that
your<00:01:27.540> body<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> most<00:01:28.490> catabolic<00:01:29.490> right

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
your body is the most catabolic right

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.660 
your body is the most catabolic right
after<00:01:30.750> an<00:01:30.990> intense<00:01:31.619> workout<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.430> why

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
after an intense workout and that's why

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
after an intense workout and that's why
post-workout<00:01:33.420> nutrition<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.799> important

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
post-workout nutrition is very important

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.609 
post-workout nutrition is very important
because<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.030> puts<00:01:36.180> our<00:01:36.420> body<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.350> growing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
because it puts our body in a growing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.550 
because it puts our body in a growing
state<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.310> opposed<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.299> throwing<00:01:40.020> us<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
state as opposed to throwing us into a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.639 
state as opposed to throwing us into a
catabolic<00:01:40.950> state<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.880> end<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.649> wasting

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
catabolic state where we end up wasting

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.219 
catabolic state where we end up wasting
muscle<00:01:44.280> okay<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.420> there's<00:01:45.600> another<00:01:45.840> time

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
muscle okay but there's another time

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.740 
muscle okay but there's another time
where<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.890> body<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.640> catabolic<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
where your body is also catabolic and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.550 
where your body is also catabolic and
that<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.850> sleep<00:01:51.240> after<00:01:51.780> X<00:01:52.110> amount<00:01:52.439> of

that is in your sleep after X amount of
hours<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.210> fasting<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.259> crucial<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.460> if

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
hours of fasting so it's crucial that if

something to slow that down like for

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.030 
something to slow that down like for
example<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.640> protein<00:02:15.910> with<00:02:16.330> casein<00:02:17.040> protein

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
example a protein with casein protein

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.300 
example a protein with casein protein
with<00:02:18.460> milk<00:02:18.820> or<00:02:19.470> protein<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:20.770> something<00:02:21.160> like

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
with milk or protein with something like

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.340 
with milk or protein with something like
a<00:02:21.340> natural<00:02:21.880> fat<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.360> peanut<00:02:22.870> butter<00:02:23.020> but

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
a natural fat like peanut butter but

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.380 
a natural fat like peanut butter but
you're<00:02:23.950> also<00:02:24.190> going<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.700> throw<00:02:24.880> in<00:02:25.180> some

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
you're also going to throw in some

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 
you're also going to throw in some
complex<00:02:26.290> carbs<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.800> they<00:02:26.920> must<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.370> complex

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
complex carbs and they must be complex

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.600 
complex carbs and they must be complex
because<00:02:28.870> they're<00:02:29.050> slow<00:02:29.410> digesting<00:02:30.160> if<00:02:30.520> you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
because they're slow digesting if you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.670 
because they're slow digesting if you
put<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.060> simple<00:02:31.330> carb<00:02:31.690> your<00:02:32.170> body<00:02:32.320> will<00:02:32.500> use

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
put in a simple carb your body will use

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.440 
put in a simple carb your body will use
it<00:02:32.830> up<00:02:32.980> right<00:02:33.460> away<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.240> slow

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
it up right away but if it's slow

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.540 
it up right away but if it's slow
digesting<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.470> will<00:02:35.680> last<00:02:35.890> you<00:02:36.190> throughout

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
digesting it will last you throughout

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.010 
digesting it will last you throughout
the<00:02:36.760> night<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.120> keep<00:02:37.300> your<00:02:37.450> body<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.930> an

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
the night and keep your body in an

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.040 
the night and keep your body in an
anabolic<00:02:38.560> state<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.220> avoid<00:02:39.550> catabolism<00:02:40.209> for

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
anabolic state and avoid catabolism for

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540 
anabolic state and avoid catabolism for
as<00:02:41.260> long<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.709> possible

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
as long as possible

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.970 
as long as possible
so<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.600> simple<00:02:44.050> guys<00:02:44.080> 30<00:02:44.590> minutes

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
so it's that simple guys 30 minutes

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.630 
so it's that simple guys 30 minutes
