00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.120 
i do remember hear him form from the
movie<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:26.540> i<00:03:26.570> don't<00:03:26.810> remember<00:03:27.080> well<00:03:27.860> his

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
movie but i don't remember well his

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.690 
movie but i don't remember well his
robot<00:03:28.460> mode<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.850> movie<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> i<00:03:31.250> think<00:03:31.400> is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
robot mode in the movie so i think is

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.670 
robot mode in the movie so i think is
pretty<00:03:31.880> much<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.120> same<00:03:32.510> i<00:03:32.750> don't<00:03:33.470> know<00:03:33.530> how

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
accurate is but it is a very fine figure

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.960
