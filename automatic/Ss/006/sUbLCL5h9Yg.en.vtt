00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.850 
take a look at the default web site on
this<00:00:45.450> server<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.970> we're<00:00:47.970> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> change

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
this server and we're going to change

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.140 
this server and we're going to change
the<00:00:49.860> default<00:00:50.130> document<00:00:50.670> type<00:00:50.790> this<00:00:50.970> is<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
the default document type this is a

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.990 
the default document type this is a
document<00:00:51.660> it'll<00:00:51.960> look<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.650> you<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.880> go

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
document it'll look for when you just go

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
document it'll look for when you just go
to<00:00:54.060> a<00:00:54.210> folder<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> we'll<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.310> it<00:00:56.430> until<00:00:56.700> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
to a folder and we'll make it until I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
to a folder and we'll make it until I
admit<00:00:57.060> that<00:00:57.180> PHP<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.620> top<00:01:00.440> so

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
admit that PHP and put it at the top so

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.340 
admit that PHP and put it at the top so
what<00:01:01.590> about<00:01:01.710> those<00:01:01.980> backups<00:01:03.019> when<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> make<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
what about those backups when you make a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.590 
what about those backups when you make a
change<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> iis<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.840> automatically<00:01:07.650> backs<00:01:07.979> up

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
change in iis it automatically backs up

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
change in iis it automatically backs up
the<00:01:09.600> settings<00:01:09.960> change<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.409> made<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> go

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the settings change you made if you go

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
the settings change you made if you go
into<00:01:11.370> the<00:01:11.490> properties<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.300> server<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
into the properties of the server and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140 
into the properties of the server and
you<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.070> backup<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.550> restore<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
you go into backup and restore you can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.800 
you go into backup and restore you can
see<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.260> got<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.590> automatic<00:01:16.890> backups

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
see here it's got some automatic backups

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
see here it's got some automatic backups
the<00:01:18.810> problem<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.560> these<00:01:19.740> backups<00:01:20.370> is<00:01:20.640> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the problem with these backups is that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
the problem with these backups is that
they're<00:01:21.180> stored<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> hard<00:01:22.200> drive<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
they're stored on the hard drive and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
they're stored on the hard drive and
they're<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> hidden<00:01:23.640> folder<00:01:24.470> that's<00:01:25.470> great

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
they're in a hidden folder that's great

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.380 
they're in a hidden folder that's great
if<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> mistake<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> go

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
if you make a mistake and you want to go

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170 
if you make a mistake and you want to go
back<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.960> undo<00:01:28.530> your<00:01:28.680> mistake<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:30.030> what

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
back and undo your mistake but what

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.980 
back and undo your mistake but what
happens<00:01:30.510> if<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:31.020> whole<00:01:31.140> server<00:01:31.409> blows<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.950> or

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
happens if the whole server blows up or

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.120 
happens if the whole server blows up or
you<00:01:33.990> even<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> take<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you even just want to take that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.530 
you even just want to take that
configuration<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.119> move<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.510> another

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
configuration and move it to another

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.920 
configuration and move it to another
server<00:01:37.820> that's<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.150> backing<00:01:39.510> up<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
server that's where backing up from the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.460 
server that's where backing up from the
command<00:01:40.260> line<00:01:40.350> works<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:40.979> great

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
command line works out great

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.680 
command line works out great
so<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:43.890> create<00:01:44.510> backups<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.600> are

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
so how do we create backups that are

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.469 
so how do we create backups that are
just<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.170> these<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.549> generated<00:01:48.330> from

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just like these here but generated from

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.320 
just like these here but generated from
the<00:01:48.570> command<00:01:48.869> line<00:01:49.670> let's<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> command

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
the command line let's go to a command

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.330 
the command line let's go to a command
line<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> show<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.310> how<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
line and I'm going to show you how to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.660 
line and I'm going to show you how to
activate<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.450> BB<00:01:55.049> script<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:56.220> built<00:01:56.490> into

activate a BB script that's built into
Windows<00:01:56.970> 2003<00:01:57.479> it's<00:01:57.930> called<00:01:58.170> IAS<00:01:58.740> config<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
Windows 2003 it's called IAS config and

Windows 2003 it's called IAS config and
to<00:02:00.659> get<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.900> to<00:02:00.990> work<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.710> call<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> at

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
to get it to work you have to call it at

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.969 
to get it to work you have to call it at
least<00:02:02.400> once<00:02:02.729> by<00:02:03.420> hand<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.650> it'll

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.770 
IAS settings is saved there so now let's
say<00:04:24.620> someone<00:04:25.010> comes<00:04:25.220> along<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.880> messes

say someone comes along and messes

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.570 
say someone comes along and messes
around<00:04:26.990> with<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.530> configuration<00:04:28.280> they<00:04:28.430> go

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
around with the configuration they go

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.379 
around with the configuration they go
into<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.970> default<00:04:29.330> document<00:04:30.080> types<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:31.389> they

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
into the default document types and they

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.300 
into the default document types and they
blow<00:04:32.600> away<00:04:32.750> everything<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:35.889> maybe<00:04:36.889> set<00:04:37.280> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
blow away everything and maybe set the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.700 
blow away everything and maybe set the
default<00:04:37.669> document<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:38.180> some<00:04:38.389> oddball<00:04:39.080> file

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
default document to some oddball file

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.340 
default document to some oddball file
that<00:04:40.389> doesn't<00:04:41.389> even<00:04:41.600> work<00:04:41.810> anymore<00:04:41.930> on<00:04:42.260> the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
that doesn't even work anymore on the

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.909 
that doesn't even work anymore on the
websites<00:04:42.710> down<00:04:42.950> now<00:04:47.350> so<00:04:48.350> how<00:04:48.470> do<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.620> restore

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
websites down now so how do we restore

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:49.890 
websites down now so how do we restore
it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.420 
it
well<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.050> command<00:04:51.410> light<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.800> restoring<00:04:52.280> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
well the command light for restoring it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.290 
well the command light for restoring it
is<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.630> as<00:04:53.780> easy<00:04:53.990> as<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.260> command<00:04:54.680> line<00:04:54.860> for

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
is just as easy as the command line for

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.110 
is just as easy as the command line for
backing<00:04:56.300> up<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.570> entire<00:04:56.870> website<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.940> let's

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
backing up the entire website so let's

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.400 
backing up the entire website so let's
go<00:04:59.210> back<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.419> our<00:04:59.750> command<00:05:00.020> line<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.639> we<00:05:01.639> will

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
go back to our command line and we will

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.730 
go back to our command line and we will
use<00:05:03.410> IAS<00:05:04.010> config<00:05:05.200> but<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.350> time<00:05:06.530> we're<00:05:06.650> going

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
use IAS config but this time we're going

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.690 
use IAS config but this time we're going
to<00:05:06.800> do<00:05:06.979> an<00:05:07.100> import<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.440> we<00:05:09.440> have<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.669> specify<00:05:10.669> a

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
to do an import and we have to specify a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.350 
to do an import and we have to specify a
source<00:05:11.180> path<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.840> destination<00:05:12.289> path<00:05:12.680> and

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
source path and a destination path and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.930 
source path and a destination path and
in<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:14.539> case<00:05:14.750> we're<00:05:15.050> going<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.350> use<00:05:16.160> local

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
in this case we're going to use local

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.050 
in this case we're going to use local
machine<00:05:17.180> for<00:05:17.330> both<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.660> them<00:05:18.789> you<00:05:19.789> can<00:05:19.910> see

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
machine for both of them you can see

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.420 
machine for both of them you can see
they're<00:05:20.210> DP<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:20.660> destination<00:05:21.289> path<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.800> SP<00:05:22.310> is

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
they're DP is destination path and SP is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.100 
they're DP is destination path and SP is
source<00:05:22.640> path<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:25.820> we're<00:05:26.720> going<00:05:26.840> to<00:05:26.900> do<00:05:27.020> the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
source path and we're going to do the

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.240 
source path and we're going to do the
same<00:05:27.289> as<00:05:27.410> before<00:05:27.530> we're<00:05:27.890> going<00:05:27.979> to<00:05:28.070> include

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
same as before we're going to include

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.060 
same as before we're going to include
all<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.850> children<00:05:29.110> all<00:05:30.110> inherited<00:05:30.620> settings

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
all the children all inherited settings

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.420 
all the children all inherited settings
and<00:05:31.960> then<00:05:32.960> we<00:05:33.139> have<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.350> specify<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:33.889> password

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
and then we have to specify the password

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.820 
and then we have to specify the password
this<00:05:35.180> has<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.600> be<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.810> same<00:05:35.990> password<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.590> use

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
this has to be the same password you use

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.400 
this has to be the same password you use
to<00:05:37.070> create<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.580> file<00:05:37.850> if<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:38.720> don't<00:05:38.900> have<00:05:39.200> it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
to create the file if you don't have it

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.750 
to create the file if you don't have it
you're<00:05:39.770> not<00:05:39.919> going<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.130> be<00:05:40.220> able<00:05:40.280> to<00:05:40.370> restore

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
you're not going to be able to restore

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.700 
you're not going to be able to restore
it<00:05:40.910> so<00:05:41.060> that's<00:05:41.810> very<00:05:42.020> important<00:05:42.350> to<00:05:42.410> keep<00:05:42.560> that

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
it so that's very important to keep that

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.820 
it so that's very important to keep that
in<00:05:42.889> a<00:05:42.950> safe<00:05:43.520> place<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:44.180> then<00:05:44.560> our<00:05:45.560> file<00:05:45.800> is

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
in a safe place and then our file is

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.500 
in a safe place and then our file is
going<00:05:46.100> to<00:05:46.160> be<00:05:46.220> the<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.000> one<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.210> we<00:05:47.300> have<00:05:47.450> in

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
going to be the the one that we have in

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.370 
going to be the the one that we have in
the<00:05:47.600> hard<00:05:47.720> drive<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:49.490> let's<00:05:49.729> do<00:05:49.850> a<00:05:49.880> restore

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
the hard drive and let's do a restore

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.040 
the hard drive and let's do a restore
see<00:05:51.380> that<00:05:51.530> was<00:05:51.650> quick<00:05:52.450> so<00:05:53.450> now<00:05:53.570> let's<00:05:53.720> go<00:05:53.870> back

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
see that was quick so now let's go back

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.620 
see that was quick so now let's go back
to<00:05:54.080> our<00:05:54.410> is<00:05:55.190> configuration<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.180> check<00:05:56.479> out

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
to our is configuration and check out

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.450 
to our is configuration and check out
our<00:05:56.780> default<00:05:57.080> settings<00:05:57.500> for<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:58.039> document

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
our default settings for the document

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.490 
our default settings for the document
types<00:05:58.639> and<00:05:58.940> as<00:05:59.570> you<00:05:59.720> can<00:05:59.870> see<00:06:00.050> here<00:06:00.289> that

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
types and as you can see here that

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.620 
types and as you can see here that
damage<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.520> was<00:06:01.639> done<00:06:01.669> before<00:06:01.940> is<00:06:02.240> totally

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
damage that was done before is totally

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.719 
damage that was done before is totally
undone<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.870> that's<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.229> folks<00:06:06.580> one-line<00:06:07.580> to

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
undone so that's it folks one-line to

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.540 
undone so that's it folks one-line to
backup<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.360> one-line<00:06:09.260> every<00:06:09.500> store<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:10.460> a

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
backup and one-line every store it's a

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:20.760 
backup and one-line every store it's a
pretty<00:06:10.729> simple<00:06:10.940> operation

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.830
