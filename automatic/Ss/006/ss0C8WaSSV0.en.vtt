a<00:00:15.000> proper<00:00:15.420> motor<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.929> went<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.010> put<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:18.260> wltoys

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
a proper motor I went and put a wltoys

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.640 
a proper motor I went and put a wltoys
v-22<00:00:20.160> -<00:00:20.400> motor<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.850> was<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.810> size<00:00:22.080> motor

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
v-22 - motor it was the same size motor

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950 
v-22 - motor it was the same size motor
same<00:00:23.070> size<00:00:23.340> shaft<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.029> said<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> swap<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
same size shaft I said to swap the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.380 
same size shaft I said to swap the
pinion<00:00:25.260> gear<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.439> wrote<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.099> obviously<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pinion gear I wrote and obviously you

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.609 
pinion gear I wrote and obviously you
know<00:00:27.529> just<00:00:28.529> solder<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.949> wires<00:00:29.160> onto<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.619> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
know just solder the wires onto it and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
know just solder the wires onto it and
this<00:00:31.769> motor<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.369> actually<00:00:32.579> underpowered

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this motor is actually underpowered

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
this motor is actually underpowered
compared<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> motor<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.770> came<00:00:34.980> with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
compared to the motor that came with

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.030 
compared to the motor that came with
this<00:00:35.250> quadcopter<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> we'll<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
this quadcopter so we'll take it for a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
this quadcopter so we'll take it for a
quick<00:00:38.250> flight<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> give<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.690> an

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
quick flight here just to give you an

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:50.540 
quick flight here just to give you an
example<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.820> underpowered<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
example as to how underpowered it is so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
example as to how underpowered it is so
you'll<00:00:50.940> find<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> transmitter<00:00:54.320> alright

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you'll find the transmitter alright

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
you'll find the transmitter alright
we're<00:00:55.469> all<00:00:55.590> bound<00:00:59.480> now<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.230> motor<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:04.010> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
we're all bound now the motor is in the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.000 
we're all bound now the motor is in the
Left<00:01:05.280> Front<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.170> originally<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.740> motor

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
Left Front now and originally the motor

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.910 
Left Front now and originally the motor
that<00:01:08.250> failed<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.119> rear<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:10.619> put

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that failed was the right rear and I put

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.149 
that failed was the right rear and I put
this<00:01:11.010> motor<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> leaned<00:01:13.650> towards

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this motor in and it it leaned towards

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740 
this motor in and it it leaned towards
the<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.430> rear<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> thought<00:01:15.090> man<00:01:15.330> maybe<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the right rear I thought man maybe the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.920 
the right rear I thought man maybe the
motor<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.259> wasn't<00:01:16.439> bad<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> did<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
motor really wasn't bad so what I did is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.320 
motor really wasn't bad so what I did is
I<00:01:19.110> took<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.470> motor<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.009> swapped<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I took the motor and swapped it to the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.890 
I took the motor and swapped it to the
left<00:01:21.570> front<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.140> now<00:01:22.799> you'll<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:24.270> favors

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
left front and now you'll see it favors

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.359 
left front and now you'll see it favors
the<00:01:25.439> left<00:01:25.680> front<00:01:25.970> it'll<00:01:26.970> hover<00:01:27.150> okay<00:01:28.189> it<00:01:29.189> has

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the left front it'll hover okay it has

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.899 
the left front it'll hover okay it has
no<00:01:29.520> problem<00:01:29.729> hovering<00:01:31.400> or<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> give<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> any

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
no problem hovering or to give it any

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.249 
no problem hovering or to give it any
throttle<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:34.110> leans<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.130> motor<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:37.049> see

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
throttle it leans to that motor you see

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:37.969 
throttle it leans to that motor you see
that<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.530> there

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
that right there

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.410 
that right there
it<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> leans<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.180> turn<00:01:39.329> if

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
it just leans right to that more turn if

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560 
it just leans right to that more turn if
you<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> yaw<00:01:40.430> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
you get it into a yaw you can see it

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.010 
you get it into a yaw you can see it
really<00:01:42.960> affects<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.530> yawn<00:01:44.509> not<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> much<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
really affects the yawn not so much to

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.499 
really affects the yawn not so much to
the<00:01:46.049> right<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:47.250> man<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.000> yard<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.420> the
