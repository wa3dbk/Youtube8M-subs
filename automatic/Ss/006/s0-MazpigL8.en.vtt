00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I just never had really had time for it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.979 
I just never had really had time for it
I<00:00:35.309> mean<00:00:35.460> obviously<00:00:35.790> after<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.450> lost<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.780> didn't

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I mean obviously after we lost I didn't

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
I mean obviously after we lost I didn't
look<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.610> we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
look at it is how because you know we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
look at it is how because you know we
could<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.899> could<00:00:40.050> taste<00:00:40.290> victory<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> guess

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
could we could taste victory but I guess

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
could we could taste victory but I guess
a<00:00:41.460> team<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> Sheep<00:00:42.180> chief<00:00:42.540> Suh<00:00:42.750> play<00:00:42.989> for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a team like the Sheep chief Suh play for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.510 
a team like the Sheep chief Suh play for
80<00:00:43.350> minutes<00:00:43.469> ago<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.520> go

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
80 minutes ago you really just got to go

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
80 minutes ago you really just got to go
to<00:00:47.579> give<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.180> fate<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.170> kind<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
to give your all fate in just kind of

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
to give your all fate in just kind of
spin<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.250> had<00:00:50.340> such<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> good

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
spin but just because we had such a good

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.930 
spin but just because we had such a good
leader<00:00:51.539> we'd<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.199> able<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> our<00:00:53.430> cruise<00:00:53.760> home

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
leader we'd be able to our cruise home

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
leader we'd be able to our cruise home
and<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.329> guess<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.930> stars<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and I guess that stars the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.920 
and I guess that stars the
disappointment<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.760> last<00:00:57.030> year<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.629> serve

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
disappointment of last year will serve

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.770 
disappointment of last year will serve
as<00:00:58.050> motivation<00:00:58.309> it's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.430> new<00:00:59.640> year<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.719> new
