you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.250 
you
but<00:00:33.899> now<00:00:34.019> i'm<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> key<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> C<00:00:35.840> which<00:00:36.840> suits

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
but now i'm in the key of C which suits

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
but now i'm in the key of C which suits
my<00:00:37.410> singer<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> happy<00:00:38.340> singer<00:00:38.930> if

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
my singer and I have a happy singer if

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.060 
my singer and I have a happy singer if
we<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.350> how<00:00:40.500> important<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.500 

I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.729 

let's<00:00:46.510> try<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.750> again<00:00:46.929> for<00:00:47.289> another<00:00:47.440> chord

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
let's try it again for another chord

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.020 
let's try it again for another chord
progression<00:00:48.100> let's<00:00:48.250> try<00:00:48.429> it<00:00:48.489> say<00:00:48.699> we've<00:00:48.850> got<00:00:49.000> a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
progression let's try it say we've got a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.410 
progression let's try it say we've got a
chord<00:00:49.269> progression<00:00:49.659> in<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.899> minor

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.520 

we<00:00:57.289> use<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.620> same<00:00:57.890> exact<00:00:58.339> logic

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.230 

and<00:01:04.530> we'll<00:01:04.710> transpose<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> D<00:01:05.610> minor<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> I'm

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and we'll transpose it to D minor so I'm

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.370 
and we'll transpose it to D minor so I'm
playing<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.659> minor<00:01:06.900> shape<00:01:07.430> d<00:01:08.430> minor<00:01:08.640> shake<00:01:08.940> a

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
playing an a minor shape d minor shake a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.490 
playing an a minor shape d minor shake a
major<00:01:10.380> shake

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
major shake

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
major shake
and<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.890> minor<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:13.690> my<00:01:13.840> route<00:01:14.140> when<00:01:14.980> I<00:01:15.040> start<00:01:15.340> out

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
and a minor so my route when I start out

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.870 
and a minor so my route when I start out
my<00:01:15.760> route<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.350> AAA<00:01:17.530> a-minor<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:18.340> here<00:01:18.760> on<00:01:18.850> the

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
my route the AAA a-minor is here on the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.410 
my route the AAA a-minor is here on the
fifth<00:01:19.150> string<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:21.460> in<00:01:21.550> order<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.820> transpose

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
fifth string so in order to transpose

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.100 
fifth string so in order to transpose
this<00:01:22.920> 22<00:01:23.920> D<00:01:24.160> minor<00:01:24.400> we<00:01:25.090> have<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.300> find<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.600> D<00:01:25.840> on

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
this 22 D minor we have to find a D on

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.460 
this 22 D minor we have to find a D on
the<00:01:27.100> fifth<00:01:27.790> string<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.690> can<00:01:28.840> substitute<00:01:29.170> for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
the fifth string that can substitute for

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.140 
the fifth string that can substitute for
my<00:01:29.560> open<00:01:29.890> with<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.130> capo<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:32.320> seen<00:01:33.150> again

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
my open with the capo so a be seen again

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.420 
my open with the capo so a be seen again
all<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.410> national<00:01:35.740> notes<00:01:35.890> are<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.100> whole<00:01:36.250> step

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
all the national notes are a whole step

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.090 
all the national notes are a whole step
apart<00:01:36.729> with<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.030> exception<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.540> B<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.650> C<00:01:38.830> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
apart with the exception of B and C and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.080 
apart with the exception of B and C and
E<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.430> F<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.800> B<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.190> C<00:01:42.369> or<00:01:42.550> half<00:01:42.729> step<00:01:42.970> apart

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
E and F so so B and C or half step apart

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.160 
E and F so so B and C or half step apart
go<00:01:43.899> up<00:01:43.960> another<00:01:44.080> whole<00:01:44.320> step<00:01:44.350> 2<00:01:44.680> D<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.960> play

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
go up another whole step 2 D I will play

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.560 
go up another whole step 2 D I will play
the<00:01:47.200> same<00:01:47.500> exact<00:01:47.890> shapes<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.610> a<00:01:48.640> minor<00:01:48.970> shape

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
the same exact shapes the a minor shape

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.700 
the same exact shapes the a minor shape
the<00:01:51.020> D<00:01:51.200> minor<00:01:51.409> shape

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the D minor shape

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.050 
the D minor shape
the<00:01:53.250> E<00:01:53.280> major<00:01:53.549> shape

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.819 

so<00:01:56.990> I'm<00:01:57.049> playing<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.350> same<00:01:57.530> chord

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
so I'm playing the same chord

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.350 
so I'm playing the same chord
progression<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:58.520> now<00:01:58.759> in<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:58.939> key<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.149> D

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
progression it's now in the key of D

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.700 
progression it's now in the key of D
minor<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.829> I<00:02:00.920> can<00:02:01.100> keep<00:02:01.450> all<00:02:02.450> my<00:02:02.810> voicings<00:02:03.380> and

chord and uses the D to the dss for
we've<00:02:34.890> already<00:02:35.070> seen<00:02:35.310> those<00:02:35.520> fingerings

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
we've already seen those fingerings

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.370 
we've already seen those fingerings
previously<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.780> we're<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:36.930> adding<00:02:37.230> the
