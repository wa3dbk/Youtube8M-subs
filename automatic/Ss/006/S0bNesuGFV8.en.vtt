used to take us to school in the car and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
used to take us to school in the car and
I<00:01:06.680> used<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.890> find<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.580> people<00:01:09.540> who<00:01:09.780> talked<00:01:10.170> on

the<00:01:10.470> radio<00:01:12.170> incredibly<00:01:13.170> relaxing<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:19.159> didn't

the<00:02:07.930> page<00:02:08.500> turning<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:11.550> yes<00:02:12.550> when<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.300> found<00:02:13.510> it

the page turning and yes when I found it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690

I found it complements ago and I just

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.490 
I found it complements ago and I just
couldn't<00:02:15.970> believe<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> also<00:02:19.540> when<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> was<00:02:19.989> um

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
couldn't believe and also when it was um

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.890 
couldn't believe and also when it was um
I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:23.550> he's<00:02:24.550> in<00:02:25.420> locks<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.760> was<00:02:28.030> my<00:02:28.690> mom

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
I think he's in locks this was my mom

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.759 
I think he's in locks this was my mom
had<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.970> big<00:02:30.970> cabinet<00:02:31.540> which<00:02:31.900> had<00:02:32.110> little

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
had this big cabinet which had little

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.920 
had this big cabinet which had little
dolls<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:34.030> used<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.330> love<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> sound

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
dolls on it and I used to love the sound

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.470 
dolls on it and I used to love the sound
of<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> keys<00:02:35.440> opening<00:02:36.130> I'm<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.269> very

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
of the keys opening I'm not very

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.350 
of the keys opening I'm not very
relaxing<00:02:38.170> too<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.580> don't<00:02:42.850> think<00:02:43.180> there's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
relaxing too but I don't think there's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.800 
relaxing too but I don't think there's
any<00:02:43.510> way<00:02:43.600> i<00:02:43.750> can<00:02:43.930> show<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:48.390> might<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.750> able

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
any way i can show you it might be able

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.089 
any way i can show you it might be able
to<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.549> would<00:02:51.700> probably<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:53.470> coming<00:02:53.830> to

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099
