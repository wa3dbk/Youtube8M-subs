00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.439
 hello I am welcome to the team 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.000
 android mexico in this video we will see 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.980
 how to record the screen of our 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.469
 device for that I'm going to demonstrate 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.739
 three applications of which the 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:35.719
 first is act skin recorder as it says 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.550
 this application does not require to be root 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.860
 the only condition to be able to use 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.100
 this application that is free is 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.800
 just have android lollipop already 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.870
 that with kat kit does not work so for 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.089
 can see this application well let's 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.330
 see simply we will appear this 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.830
 small this small as an icon for 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.559
 to be able to configure it because we go to the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.879
 tab to the configuration button and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.729
 here we will be able to configure 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.409
 for example if we want to 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.119
 example change the resolution here we go 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.850
 to have all the features to 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.960
 to be able to change the resolution resolution 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 what is the bit rate 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.270
 and nothing else those are the only two 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.619
 options that will allow us 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 configure more than everything for recording 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.570
 in this application there we have 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 options like for example 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 audio recording will not show the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 touches as you can see the little ball 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 not white and what for example can 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.360
 show the front camera this option 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.040
 is with the paid application 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.110
 there is not a paid application for it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.540
 for example, is this option 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 also wait what sword then 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.750
 some options that will allow us 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.369
 in this application that is free 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.440
 simply to be able to record then 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.690
 we give this option here and we are already 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.160
 recording not as we can see we are going to 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.950
 Properly test with a game by 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.100
 example that submitted to see how 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.590
 run is this application we are going to a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.899
 little and volume and we go for example here 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.100
 and here how can we see how it is 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.530
 occurring in the application not 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.930
 it has a small delay and all of it 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 but the benefits that we will 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.120
 work on android 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.000
 lollipop without requiring without 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.890
 takes root not be just having 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.390
 the duration and we view it 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.920
 here to the image as a kind of 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.569
 gallery and here we have our video 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.580
 we just select it we choose 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.340
 the application and good because 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.630
 we want it to open and here is the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.350
 small recording that we have made not 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.630
 as you can see 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.970
 I've been listening to the microphone all 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 what I 've been talking about here looks 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.190
 how is the application running 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.920
 this explanation is Nestor as I said the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.130
 only requirement is to be generating 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.980
 lollipop and not be one 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.440
 can make the first application the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.510
 next application is rec screen 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.490
 remember this application also allows 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.020
 record our unique screen the 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.570
 conditions is that if we have android 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.090
 kitkat then we're going to require 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.370
 root access but if we have android 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.680
 lollipop because it simply is not going to be 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.290
 necessary so we just give it to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.370
 network to the sorry application and here 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.190
 we will be able to configure 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.610
 quickly our resolution the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.550
 bit bit rate not in this case of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.920
 japan the 16th in duration the duration of 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.450
 video the audio we are going to solution to the audio 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.070
 and the file in which the name of the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.750
 file that we want to record here 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.420
 us within these options 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.940
 we can configure the application though 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.610
 the whole location what is the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.610
 rotation and good if we want for example 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.020
 these options or for example show the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.430
 press as in the previous application 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.060
 if he showed us what the dot was 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.540
 for this we are going to require the application 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.659
 that the pro application is paid 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.790
 that is also is something that a 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.230
 disadvantage in this application but the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.849
 Another advantage is that you can use the 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.769
 team as long as we are root 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.950
 let's do the test we are 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.550
 recording our presumed counter of 10 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.340
 seconds we wait fast 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.860
 that more quickly how to relocate from 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.420
 that this application also pedroches 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.730
 I have the cake place, let's try 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.280
 geometry is to see what such that 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.690
 run 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.790
 but let's lower the volume a little 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.820
 and there it is as we can see 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.620
 in this application as the game runs 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 a little better 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.080
 it is recorded a little better as we can see 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.290
 and that's what this application is like 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 can see so far continued operated 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.770
 but I was a little better with compression 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.169
 in the previous application 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.060
 correct and green that I am showing 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.550
 on the benefits and disadvantages of each 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.889
 one of the applications in this case we 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.889
 lets put the little button 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.259
 show forgiveness the good pulsation 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.180
 achieved but opens a volume a little more 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.020
 low 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.190
 image but runs a little better 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.300
 Although we have put the same 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.910
 amount of king bit that are 16 in both 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.430
 applications does not allow us to configure 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.110
 what frames per second are not 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.910
 but it is free in the play store as 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.680
 I already told a book how they downloaded it 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.080
 and we're going to see the latest application and the 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.240
 latest application is screen record of 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.600
 same way this application if we 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.880
 We are lollipop users is does not require 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.380
 be root but if we are users that yes 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.880
 it requires to be root let's see 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.740
 quickly this application that is 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.360
 free in the projector once the 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.130
 we select then we appear here 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.660
 these little buttons very similar to the 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.880
 first application we are going to give you the 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.370
 configuration and here we are going to 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.160
 to be able to configure anything here 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.530
 we will be able to see in our resolution 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.100
 the quality of life craig not in this case 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.440
 is in a lot and here allows us to put 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.410
 the frames per second in this case I 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.050
 I've put 60 that is this one better 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.970
 video quality we are going to put the 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.870
 audio recording is also going to 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.580
 ask to acquire the application of pay for 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.410
 example this application what will we 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.390
 allow is to record for example our 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.850
 face is going to enter the camera 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.400
 front to record our face 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.250
 also will not be able to show the touches 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.900
 and very well to be able to record to be able 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.820
 do the test we go to the little button 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.830
 second button once we are here 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.080
 we give the button to be able to record and 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.910
 there will start with an accountant but 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.620
 there will start with this screen that 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.129
 is already recording at that time as 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.369
 can be activated in my front camera 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:49.050
 and is recording the application we are not going to 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:51.899
 try again with geometries to 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.289
 that they see to see what so how it runs not 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:57.479
 there is the game as you can see it is 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:00.599
 work a little more fluid cooperation 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:04.990
 of the other two of the other two games 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:07.120
 no pardon of the other two applications 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.770
 of the first two that I showed good 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.490
 let's quickly see the live 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.500
 Serious vertical of the video application 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.180
 and there it is there is our little 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.190
 video video that we have nailed 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.220
 as you can see here the camera appears 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.680
 frontal like this with 60 frames per 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.180
 second the video quality is a bit 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.009
 best 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.160
 as you can see also by the way 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:32.520
 the only detail would be the recording of 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.800
 Audio 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.930
 or as you can see those are the three 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.620
 applications that we have been able to see are 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.090
 free 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.849
 in the text I recommend that you 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.860
 Download them to try the one that best 

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.270
 what will interest them most will work 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.849
 in the description of the video will be 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:49.259
 also the links so they can 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.370
 download these applications very well 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.229
 this in this video is because it has 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.819
 liked do not forget to give it a very like 

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:56.039
 subscribe to the channel subscribe to my 

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.990
 channel that I'm jack too but of my 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.340
 social networks facebook twitter samba in 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.409
 all this will be in the description of 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.240
 video could be this video but they 

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:05.629
 have liked to see you until the next 

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.629
 video
