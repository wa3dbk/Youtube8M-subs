00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everybody got my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.720
 I can see with a new video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.540
 to be able to discuss with your voices 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.090
 my afro since it was a little 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 moment that I made my video that we 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 explain to me why did I 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 disassembled a thousand doc this movement and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 company and I stood in the crowd to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.000
 you news 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 for me what is happening at 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 especially since it was asked by 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.650
 the queen on facebook and I told myself 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.210
 but why not since I already had 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 intend to make a video 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 about this subject adam so to lie 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.809
 soon you're freaking out saying to yourself 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.660
 could on his hair et cetera na I 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 did not cut my hair but it's 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 just that I did some kind of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.390
 Rodchenko makes these two matches 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 were weight and go since I 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 wet my hair I was going for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.530
 sir does not house the troops 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.329
 open to scratch and then bat gc 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 dry in the open air for the simple and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.859
 good reason I did something 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.799
 who reminds you that I went to 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.350
 lay down his attachment to be doing 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.299
 two mats et cetera and so on and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 cetera since I keep good but 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.590
 bad mania that I had when 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.159
 I called melox except that here I 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.950
 wake up in the morning 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.049
 sir to tie pure style as if 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.689
 they are fine but there no no no 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.049
 black red and pay that no I have 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.600
 a steve head like that like that or 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.990
 well weird the only solution that 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.549
 exists that is fast more or less 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 immediate is that I wet the 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.539
 hair well as it should and I 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.659
 make a water probe like that so 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.259
 it was my wet ngoma watch and go and or 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.849
 so both honor do not know when 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.920
 I like it a lot to know 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.979
 to have my hideous but it's just 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.599
 really there are times when this little 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.799
 son y more than the mechanism must 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.780
 get and so and and that's what my 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.159
 others I think it's really 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.159
 a good experience and then 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.410
 it also allows to see that we are not 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.030
 defined only by our appearance 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.830
 since I discussed it during my video 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.129
 concerning the convoy of the votes etc. 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.959
 how was this and 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.360
 it's true that people met 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.519
 on the appearance is at the limit to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.370
 ask for accounts where the reason for 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.290
 which I did what I did but 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.590
 what can I say c cop same at 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.370
 through my hair I learn ponroy 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.560
 I learn for my personal life on 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.160
 mac for my professional life japan 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.860
 for my spiritual life to know how to assume 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.750
 my choices and to accept them fully 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.030
 it is not played in the si ryan dad and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.890
 so I get up I mandate one day I 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 say I was naked with mellon I 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.680
 think that at least gtg confident and that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.209
 I did not have that look of others or in 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 maybe I already had it but 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.970
 the fact that I have already been used to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.959
 melox and that he had no change 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.019
 I thought it was probably 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.239
 something else but then having a 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.739
 new head is to notice again 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.549
 sharper still more sensitive to 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.769
 look at others it's like 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.569
 very easily question yourself 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.049
 and to think that finally we were better 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.440
 before 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.140
 other but really 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.360
 even through what they cap it is 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.970
 a lot and that's the good state doctor 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.030
 ciolos must always be proud of 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.550
 choice that makes it clear that the choices 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.620
 that we do we assume them fully that 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.970
 even if after that there are the people who 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.010
 wish to make us 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.570
 derogatory comments successful after 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 to people who do not go to us 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.200
 look like a messiah after the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.370
 people who will decide to put a 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 distance between her and us but this 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.490
 that it is necessary to know in any case it is that 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.860
 we remain that we are without 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.780
 as much to compromise our people without 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.090
 to compromise my personality 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.060
 since they have married since more relay 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.100
 sad to be a few words nepal 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 just can you just to 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 please someone who does not like us 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.700
 for everyone 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.850
 ok so here and even if ios is true 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.450
 javou fauna and the wii so I can the 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.450
 philosophy 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.270
 Yes 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.680
 no justin vogel video yes I'm having fun at 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.870
 my little thing to me 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.150
 and so until the next video 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.190
 the railwayman really does a kiss two 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.630
 wheels also you know that my hair 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.530
 and I'm doing well 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.800
 I still have the invention to equalize 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.509
 since after the clash of melox 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.850
 jd parts are longer than 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.590
 others and so that's the breakage action 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.820
 this project me damous makes his cause of me 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.889
 it's not me it's because the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.259
 small participants he left more 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.880
 big is not seen too much but when 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.860
 these nights also a little bit the same 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.120
 thing so that's box that it can 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.639
 that I size to have someone come 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.020
 a portion equal to resurface for 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.810
 hair and piss there's a thumb and company 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.090
 I'm still here and the news for 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.090
 halloween lease
