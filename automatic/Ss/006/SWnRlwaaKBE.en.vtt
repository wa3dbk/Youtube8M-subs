00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.700
 salami it takes a nice thin salami a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 farmer's salami 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 then I took the pizza dough 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 then I place the pasta on 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 cut board in two 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.420

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.360

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 salt the desire to cover a rolling pin 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.930
 then shooting 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.900
 the first disc takes slightly longer 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.790

 let's cut our bribe 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:26.920
 from dini then we put our salami 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.620
 pinch of Parmesan and I would go to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.550
 color with maximum leaves 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 we have already lit the oven at 170 degrees 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.700
 I wouldn't go much on the violent because 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.989
 otherwise we risk burning there 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.690

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.330
