00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.670 
stick out the kid and then he went up
and<00:04:31.150> beat<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> crap<00:04:31.509> out<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.810> him<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.199> I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
and beat the crap out of him and I

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.960 
and beat the crap out of him and I
looked<00:04:32.919> at<00:04:33.070> his<00:04:33.160> face<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.460> he<00:04:33.729> was<00:04:33.849> all

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
looked at his face and he was all

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.390 
looked at his face and he was all
bruised<00:04:34.270> up<00:04:34.570> I<00:04:34.900> think<00:04:35.740> he<00:04:35.830> had<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:35.949> black<00:04:36.220> eye

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
bruised up I think he had a black eye

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.939 
bruised up I think he had a black eye
i'm<00:04:36.669> not<00:04:36.820> sure<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:37.300> he<00:04:38.229> got<00:04:38.380> beat<00:04:38.590> up<00:04:38.620> really

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
i'm not sure but he got beat up really

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.730 
i'm not sure but he got beat up really
bad<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.570> don't<00:04:41.020> even<00:04:41.110> think<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.470> kid<00:04:41.650> who

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
bad and I I don't even think the kid who

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.980 
bad and I I don't even think the kid who
beat<00:04:41.889> him<00:04:42.039> up<00:04:42.190> got<00:04:42.490> in<00:04:42.520> trouble<00:04:42.789> because<00:04:43.150> he

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
beat him up got in trouble because he

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.350 
beat him up got in trouble because he
was<00:04:44.110> actually<00:04:44.229> one<00:04:44.560> picking<00:04:44.889> on<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.099> kid<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:46.030> I

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
was actually one picking on the kid so I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.710 
was actually one picking on the kid so I
think<00:04:46.630> he<00:04:46.870> got<00:04:47.020> suspended<00:04:47.440> again<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.099> I<00:04:48.820> I'm

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
think he got suspended again and I I'm

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.420 
think he got suspended again and I I'm
not<00:04:49.960> sure<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.380> I'm<00:04:50.470> not<00:04:50.560> exactly<00:04:50.979> ready<00:04:51.250> to
