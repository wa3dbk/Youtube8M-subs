worthy you know talking about and it was
basically<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:24.119> find<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.480> more<00:00:24.689> about<00:00:24.750> these

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
basically we find out more about these

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.920 
basically we find out more about these
big<00:00:25.470> giant<00:00:25.769> kids<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:27.000> long<00:00:27.539> were<00:00:27.660> there<00:00:27.810> on

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
big giant kids that long were there on

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.980 
big giant kids that long were there on
the<00:00:28.050> island<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.970> bigger<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.570> like

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the island they the bigger they get like

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510 
the island they the bigger they get like
when<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:31.320> all<00:00:31.439> came<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.949> they<00:00:32.070> were<00:00:32.189> normal

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
when they all came that they were normal

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.950 
when they all came that they were normal
size<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> ones<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:33.420> been<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.690> long

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
size but the ones I've been there long

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920 
size but the ones I've been there long
it's<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.350> Giants<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> had<00:00:36.690> me<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it's other Giants so it kind of had me a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
it's other Giants so it kind of had me a
little<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.559> okay<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.129> these<00:00:38.520> are

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
little bit like okay so these are

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.520 
little bit like okay so these are
experiments<00:00:39.149> these<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.660> obviously<00:00:39.840> sees<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
experiments these are obviously sees a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
experiments these are obviously sees a
clown<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.340> behind<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
clown is more behind this because you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
clown is more behind this because you
know<00:00:43.110> I'm<00:00:43.620> sure<00:00:43.680> law<00:00:44.280> helped<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
know I'm sure law helped out with you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.880 
know I'm sure law helped out with you
know<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.660> other<00:00:45.809> stuff<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> believe<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
know some other stuff but I believe that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.100 
know some other stuff but I believe that
everything<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.000> giant<00:00:48.539> babies

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
everything to do with these giant babies

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680 
everything to do with these giant babies
probably<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> caesar<00:00:50.640> clown<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.629> we

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
probably has to do a caesar clown now we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.810 
probably has to do a caesar clown now we
see<00:00:52.230> law<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.980> chapter<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
see law on this chapter as well at the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
see law on this chapter as well at the
very<00:00:53.879> end<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.860> people<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.190> been

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
very end and a lot of people have been

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
very end and a lot of people have been
theorizing<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.210> i<00:00:57.360> believe<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.410> well

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
theorizing it and i believe this as well

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.189 
theorizing it and i believe this as well
the<00:00:59.160> reason<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.760> why<00:01:00.239> law<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.840> teaming

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the reason probably why law is teaming

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.720 
the reason probably why law is teaming
up<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.379> caesar<00:01:01.620> clown<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.460> most<00:01:02.640> likely

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
up with caesar clown it's most likely

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.690 
up with caesar clown it's most likely
because<00:01:03.120> he<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.539> has<00:01:04.019> his<00:01:04.320> crew<00:01:04.920> some

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because he probably has his crew some

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.880 
because he probably has his crew some
way<00:01:05.850> who<00:01:06.060> knows<00:01:06.240> maybe<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.990> giant<00:01:07.500> babies

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
way who knows maybe these giant babies

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.940 
way who knows maybe these giant babies
are<00:01:08.130> some<00:01:08.369> transformations<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.500> laws<00:01:10.500> crew

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
are some transformations of laws crew

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.100 
are some transformations of laws crew
who<00:01:11.280> knows<00:01:11.549> that's<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.540> crazy<00:01:12.750> theory

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
who knows that's just a crazy theory

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
who knows that's just a crazy theory
throwing<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> basically<00:01:14.970> that's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
throwing out there and basically that's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
throwing out there and basically that's
what<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.680> believe<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.040> why

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
what I'm going with I believe that's why

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
what I'm going with I believe that's why
I<00:01:17.250> lost<00:01:17.490> teaming<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> guy<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
I lost teaming up with this guy because

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.469 
I lost teaming up with this guy because
usually<00:01:18.780> law<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.710> he's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.150> crazy<00:01:21.150> guy<00:01:21.450> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
usually law you know he's a crazy guy I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
usually law you know he's a crazy guy I
doubt<00:01:22.020> he<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.320> team<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.680> somebody

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
doubt he would team up with somebody

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
doubt he would team up with somebody
like<00:01:23.159> caesar<00:01:23.880> clown<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.990> think

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
like caesar clown so I kind of think

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
like caesar clown so I kind of think
that<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> case<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that you know the case with that and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.060 
that you know the case with that and
basically<00:01:27.630> these<00:01:28.020> babies<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
basically these babies have this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
basically these babies have this
addiction<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.869> need<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.470> eat<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
addiction that they need to eat this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
addiction that they need to eat this
certain<00:01:32.250> candy<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.509> start<00:01:33.780> raging

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
certain candy if not they start raging

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
certain candy if not they start raging
and<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.070> even<00:01:35.520> goes<00:01:36.000> crazy

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and one of them actually even goes crazy

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
and one of them actually even goes crazy
you<00:01:36.570> said<00:01:36.840> you'd<00:01:37.020> give<00:01:37.229> me<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> candy<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you said you'd give me the candy and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
you said you'd give me the candy and
that<00:01:39.030> was<00:01:39.150> basically<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.630> bit<00:01:40.229> weird<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> be

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that was basically like bit weird to be

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.319
