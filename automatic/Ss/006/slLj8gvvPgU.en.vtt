right and then when the day was coming
and<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.030> crunch<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:31.110> about<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and the crunch time was was about to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.440 
and the crunch time was was about to
happen<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.150> basically

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
happen we got all of these it basically

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
went from 600 to say 1200 helmet designs

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
went from 600 to say 1200 helmet designs
yeah<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> took<00:01:40.950> me<00:01:41.009> about<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.340> days<00:01:41.369> time<00:01:42.299> to
