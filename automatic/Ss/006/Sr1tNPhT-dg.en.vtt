00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.510
 of movement is going very well 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.270
 we have these transportation for when 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.690
 we some elite 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.670
 it does not imprison us when we want to escape 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.729
 anytime worth what we 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.400
 as a defense to escape we do not have to 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.119
 give a hole of forgiveness that I can not 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.160
 talk wormhole we already have here 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.710
 what makes you allows you to master 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.530

 1st brand that we have it with orb 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 frozen 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.140
 ok this is all in which also 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.869
 a long time ago and as you see almost 400 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.460
 percent let's see this wheel in 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 action ok we put here armor and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 we get the magic weapon and I will 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.990
 I highly recommend it but this one is very 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.580
 I recommend it online, so like the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.729
 I recommend online this is a wii the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.399
 distance for multiplayer we are going to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.619
 go to the multiplayer and let's record 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.060
 good people we are here in the online and 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.280
 it seems that people are already here 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.690
 hitting hosts we will see if we 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.690
 we can join enters entered 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.760
 ok let's put the armor here 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.350
 of magic weapon and we started to throw 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.670
 comets to see a moment that if there is a 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.800
 little now 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.319
 of fps because he's getting used to 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.379
 this is worth as you see I am here giving 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.120
 there is also another there is another magician with 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.670
 blizzard the truth is that it is usually 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.310
 use a lot if you do not wear this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.680
 sport put blizzard but the truth 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.510
 I prefer trÃ©port as you see 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.700
 pretty good you see it freezes you have 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.379
 here a couple of kites then I had with 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.310
 the albercanos and look how much damage you do 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.829
 which is a last look at the numbers is worth 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 and with the moon is passive good 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.060
 look how he killed him because I keep doing 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.769
 a million this gives me and the meteorite a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.139
 million much harm the truth is that 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.049
 stuck hit pretty I have a 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.239
 team good a team the truth is that 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.480
 pretty good but they also loose 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.519
 Decent objects also the truth is 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.340
 what of the loot 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.959
 the subject of the prof yes that they have touched and the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.449
 truth is that you have decent equipment left 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.239
 really you can go to you can go like this 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.590
 more or less what what equal you 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.419
 it will cost more you will have to go more with 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.129
 you will not be able to and will be like me 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.500
 look for example here there is an elite and 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.930
 quite elites work on this the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.340
 diodes and let's start here to leite 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.180
 let's give him the beacon here he danced 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.180
 froze 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.540
 he froze him so that he puts him and has 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.579
 possibilities of freezing the meteorite and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.280
 As you can see, it's worth to him with this skill 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.760
 with the magic mi6 we recover the power 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.799
 arcane in a moment thanks to the passive 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.739
 that he commented before he expects that they kill 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.689
 we kill is breaded you are looking for and this is 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.800
 the exciting thing that if I'm just that 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.490
 here 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.700
 I'm looking at some time thanks to the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.790
 passive is the prodigy 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.790
 that is not talked about because skills 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.310
 Now thanks to this voucher and good I 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 penalty is made that 10 percent more 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.970
 All life is good when you are in 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.160
 frozen or frozen a little bit by 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.500
 one hundred more of the year we have domain worth 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.440
 I recommend this a lot. 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.810
 I 've customized it, it's worth it 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 look at the water and even an Englishman me 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.210
 I looked at the with and more or less mere 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.669
 can you tell me I copied it I did not put it more 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.919
 me to my way of seeing it as I liked 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.110
 more in the houses and distributes very well the 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.729
 true that the part but very much what 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.650
 I recommend quite a lot, I highly recommend 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.650
 this 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.680
 the team theme more than anything recover 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.960
 the ark is not going to recover ark not have 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.449
 this will be everything is worth and have 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.009
 this here is done in everything and 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.800
 then the team then an armor of 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.750
 tarrasa and a body of the storm no 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.340
 I'd be better there's better this is not 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.770
 the ideal team is worth I have not looked at the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.960
 I have not been looked at by the team 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.360
 exactly because there are now new 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.660
 statistics there are more statistics already what 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.490
 this is not recommended 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.280
 example I have fallen I have fallen from had 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.010
 all other pants I have fallen playing and 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.889
 now this is better than the one I had 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.320
 so I do not know I do not know more or less now 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.630
 witch hour ' to increase the damage what 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.690
 typical go that you of intelligence that 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.870
 give you vitality to give you the gloves and 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.030
 such critical blow damage kit possibilities 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.979
 of critical blow the rings also that 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.960
 they have the possibility of critical blow and 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.550
 such a very important the possibility of 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.770
 critical hit competition to have 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.380
 always to always have the power to 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.050
 Arcane as you can see a little bit to the sack 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.440
 for people but only around here so that 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.910
 what delivers this 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.320
 you'll see I'll put in here look if 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.620
 come with me if I am here who 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.840
 strip 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.380
 have with me well with me 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.199
 make way do not hurt me good to see 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.580
 if a large number of bugs comes 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.650
 because it is that if it does not come in a number 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.780
 big said I can not teach anything that 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.389
 what's said please I said so look 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.669
 what habits do you want to look at how they fall 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.669
 the level 1 torment with that alone 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.889
 level increase one has that there is a 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.330
 elite we are alone against him right now 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.699
 it's worth it I recommend it to play 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:26.470
 with people, but as you can see, 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.470
 kill a flower of fire my mother 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:33.550
 I recommend very much to be 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.590
 but they're going to kill do not exhaust the game 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.030
 good dead for the game because as 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.229
 you and explaining things when I 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.240
 aware that he was there in the trap 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:41.760
 and what they have put now that you can 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.110
 revive in the corpse that is very well 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.940
 but hey I recommend them enough 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.340
 the dead do not pay attention to this thing of dying 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.260
 It's worth it, there was not little, which 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.729
 I want to go and I'm not, I'm not 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.070
 but estimated game by explaining the 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.020
 things because as you see that look in a 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.930
 moment pim pam pim pam and a million and a 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.220
 million and until then dead so this 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.400
 It's all people I hope you like the 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:08.490
 wind I'll look to bring another and up 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.490
 then see you leave a comment
