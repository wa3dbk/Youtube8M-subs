00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.579
 very well to some gentlemen 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.579
 time discover the elite is quoted 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.200
 he had metal washers and 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.309
 tofs soaked in an acid that piled 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.010
 on each other 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.590
 it made a stack of puck and the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.300
 electric battery it says electricity that 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.900
 must be something that comes out by a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.530
 wire and who go in by another then 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.089
 they were turning more than one side and less 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.949
 on the other and decided that 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:05.120
 electricity go from the most to the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:07.310
 less and then there quite randomly 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.240
 to know exactly it would have been necessary 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.530
 see the atoms closely 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.030
 today thanks to our cameras 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.860
 special we are able 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
 ladies and gentlemen to introduce you 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:24.380
 a few atoms who wanted to come 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.270
 in our studios to explain us a 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.450
 atom is first a nucleus with 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.580
 more electric shock around come 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.460
 turn electric shock - these are 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.820
 the electrons when there are so many more 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:45.680
 that 2 - samuel electrical charges 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.150
 the atom is electrically other but 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.420
 the electrons are kind enough 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.430
 wandering 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.400
 so as soon as he misses an electron and he 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.240
 there is a charge more than it has rained canceled 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.510
 the atom is no longer neutral 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.190
 he becomes positive one is no longer he him 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.430
 number of electrons plus the atom is 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.500
 positive he will only have one desire the sheet metal 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.950
 of course it is to recover 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.950
 electrons 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.539
 at 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 these electrons walkman we call them 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.070
 free electrons only 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.360
 electrons that are randomly walking this 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.110
 is not that which disintegrates site is 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.390
 useful but assuming we have two sons 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 of copper with between the two a kind 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 vacuum cleaner electrons on one side we will have 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.910
 a lot of free electron 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.520
 it's the less side of the other side there 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.390
 will miss the atoms will be positive 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.960
 that's the plus side there is between 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.520
 two sons 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.460
 what's called a difference of 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.770
 potential of volts 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.240
 why volts with the gentleman who 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:01.420
 invented the electric battery was called 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.490
 sir volta and more he misses 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.010
 of electrons on one side plus the difference 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.000
 potential is great over there 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.800
 volts all the long parades the atoms 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.990
 have only one desire of course it's to 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.530
 recover the electrons that are in 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.530
 the other son 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.730
 we will let them go 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.909
 electrons we will make them a passage 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.720
 but very very narrow the filament of a 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.000
 lamp for example 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.100
 so the electrons rushes her this 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.150
 almost jostles the atoms do not know 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.520
 no more where to give head 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.940
 it rubs that warms it makes the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.940
 light 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.940
 1 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:50.430
 that we have a current of electrons that goes from 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.870
 less to the more awake our gentlemen 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.400
 it was a little misleading 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.470
 it must be said that he did not know yet 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.460
 what electro was on one side 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.530
 so an electron pump a generator 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.900
 on the other a receiver ie a 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.160
 device or the electrons goes into 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.390
 making energy full radiator engine 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.060
 electric etc 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.070
 and if we recover that the energy of a 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.860
 side we must provide the other 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:27.450
 side or generators in the batteries that's 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.630
 of chemical energy an as he attacked 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.330
 metal when the acid is spent there is 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 more volts we can also use 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.400
 solar energy 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.270
 we can also rotate a magnet 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.460
 in front of a reel there must be 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
 mechanical energy 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.340
 it's a bit like that but then we 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.010
 more complicated than he made 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.510
 the electricity that comes to you but 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.229
 do not try to find out where is the most 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.229
 and where she least 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.890
 it's a current that change meaning 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.160
 all the time an alternating current 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.160
 but we'll talk about it again 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160
