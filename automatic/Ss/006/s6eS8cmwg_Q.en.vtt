00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.439
 so we got the new mac mini to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.580
 the moment we just unpacked we have 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.430
 installed the system so just to see 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.590
 a little bit what it looks like so we 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.560
 has a format that is still very very 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 square all metal 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.010
 it does not look like the ipad 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 seen like that we know more about who is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.380
 who and who 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 so there is really a unity of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 design then the party so the party 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 before overflow that are still pretty 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.700
 pretty sharp the back part with 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.030
 the connectors so here since 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.070
 diet were integrated we have a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 outlet for ventilation we did not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 rotates for a very long time we just 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.690
 watch a bit of one or two videos on 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.520
 Youtube 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 we feel that the hard drive crackle a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.039
 little one hears it small of a little respite 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 tomorrow and maybe we'll hear a 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.159
 little also the fan it looks 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.830
 to be mild enough but compared to 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.070
 the old mac mini cave the power supply 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.049
 external 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.119
 it may be a little bit more 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.010
 noisy but we'll see it after having it 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.400
 tested and here we have another novelty the 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.990
 sd card reader 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.100
 so that's good it's not 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.229
 not very practical to have it behind 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.549
 but at the same time the machine and is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.170
 really pretty flat she move 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.310
 easily that it will not be 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.590
 complicated to put his map to see 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 what does it give compared to an old 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.710
 mac mini it's simple we have this one so 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.710
 here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.939
 so we see right away that he is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:01.830
 much more much wider 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:07.930
 it is also much more 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.729
 then from above and actually to see if 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.110
 we really want to be aware of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.510
 new dimensions if you have a 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.750
 time capsule you know what it looks like 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.140
 the new mac mini 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.340
 when it's exactly a few small 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.319
 details close the same 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:33.730
 the same format so here's a top so 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.840
 we put the min over we really 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 the same dimensions 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 basically if you want to know what 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.950
 looks like the next time capsule 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.590
 next see the mini mac today so 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 it's really the same format 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.830
 which is not surprising in itself since 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.540
 in a time capsule Ã  la carte 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.549
 electronic hard drive 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.090
 feeding so finally we 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.930
 falls 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 we fall back on the same type of design and 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:07.390
 the same format then the other novelty 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.190
 it's access to internal components 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.170
 so there actually in relation to this 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.910
 we knew before we needed a 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910
 putty knife to open the c 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.730
 zero can simpler so the part 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.870
 lower we put the two inches we have 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.640
 two small landmarks the farm is open 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.890
 we put back the two thumbs we turn a 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:33.190
 little bit hop it's done we can serve 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.150
 and it gives access to the two gigas of 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.790
 ram generously offered by apple 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.750
 if we want to put a veil over there 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.750
 simply lift here 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:53.439
 and to close so it's stuff 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.930
 very scared it's almost more difficult to 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:00.639
 close that open and that's a small 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.139
 blow these facts is actually the mac 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.590
 mini rests on this surface it is 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:09.209
 a little bit elevated actually no it's 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.299
 light but here it serves both 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.560
 two access doors and small onlookers 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.560
 small supports for the mac mini 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:25.289
 there is always a nice finish a 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.289
 ultra simple design 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.670
 with the old
