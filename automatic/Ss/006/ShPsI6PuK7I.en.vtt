00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
gonna show you how to make my drop shaft

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.539 
gonna show you how to make my drop shaft
and<00:00:03.899> wattle<00:00:04.230> out<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.440> combined<00:00:04.740> now<00:00:05.069> first<00:00:05.400> of

and wattle out of combined now first of

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.760 
and wattle out of combined now first of
all<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.670> very<00:00:05.819> important<00:00:06.359> note<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.080> got

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
all a very important note on this I got

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.820 
all a very important note on this I got
my<00:00:08.130> directional<00:00:08.910> tip<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.480> tip<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.620> L

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
my directional tip the tip of that L

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
my directional tip the tip of that L
will<00:00:11.160> call<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.340> north<00:00:12.320> east<00:00:13.320> south<00:00:14.160> west<00:00:15.059> now

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
will call that north east south west now

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
will call that north east south west now
the<00:00:16.340> sort<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.400> entrance<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.090> your<00:00:18.949> water

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the sort of entrance to your water

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.710 
the sort of entrance to your water
ladder<00:00:20.160> needs<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.730> facing<00:00:20.910> north<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
ladder needs to be facing north so you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
ladder needs to be facing north so you
need<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.050> walking<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> walking

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
need to be walking into it and walking

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.609 
need to be walking into it and walking
south<00:00:24.000> otherwise<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.570> won't<00:00:24.720> work<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.470> just

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
south otherwise it won't work it's just

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.960 
south otherwise it won't work it's just
the<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> water<00:00:26.250> blocks<00:00:26.550> function

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the way that the water blocks function

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060 
the way that the water blocks function
now<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.199> we're<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> show<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
now first off we're going to show this

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.870 
now first off we're going to show this
is<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> base<00:00:29.580> layer<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.460> design<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.730> need

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
is the base layer of the design you need

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.040 
is the base layer of the design you need
two<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.239> because<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.660> makes<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
two of these because that makes a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.549 
two of these because that makes a
two-block<00:00:34.710> hide<00:00:34.890> doorway<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> put<00:00:36.600> one

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
two-block hide doorway then you put one

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950 
two-block hide doorway then you put one
of<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.430> top<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.480> sort<00:00:39.870> of

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
of these on top which is your sort of

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.350 
of these on top which is your sort of
first<00:00:40.559> rung<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.579> water<00:00:41.790> ladder<00:00:42.000> will<00:00:42.180> say

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
first rung in the water ladder will say

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580 
first rung in the water ladder will say
because<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> caps<00:00:43.020> across<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> doorway

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
because that caps across the doorway

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
because that caps across the doorway
that<00:00:44.070> creates<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.610> wrong<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that creates the first wrong which is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.549 
that creates the first wrong which is
through<00:00:45.360> buckeye<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.110> jump<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
through buckeye so you can jump up and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
through buckeye so you can jump up and
just<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.059> goes<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.300> top

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just get it and then that goes on top

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
just get it and then that goes on top
will<00:00:48.629> call<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.899> run<00:00:49.110> camp<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
will call that a run camp I'm going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
will call that a run camp I'm going to
show<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.670> how<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.059> build<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.260> make

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
show you how to build it now just make

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.160 
show you how to build it now just make
things<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.280> easier<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.940> guys

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
things a little bit easier if you guys

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.209 
things a little bit easier if you guys
it<00:00:55.170> always<00:00:55.410> helps<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> see<00:00:55.829> things<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.100> are

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it always helps to see things that are

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.340 
it always helps to see things that are
made<00:00:56.399> i<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.510> first<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:57.989> we've<00:00:58.230> got

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
made i think so first of all we've got

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.740 
made i think so first of all we've got
the<00:00:58.440> base<00:00:58.649> shape<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.730> simple<00:01:00.120> it's

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the base shape here very simple it's

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.310 
the base shape here very simple it's
three<00:01:01.230> three<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.399> middle<00:01:03.320> one

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
three three and two in the middle one

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.830 
three three and two in the middle one
two<00:01:04.530> three<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.250> two<00:01:05.720> one<00:01:06.720> two<00:01:07.909> three<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
two three one two one two three now the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920 
two three one two one two three now the
next<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.590> first<00:01:10.799> rung<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> ladder<00:01:11.930> comes

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
next the first rung in the ladder comes

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.660 
next the first rung in the ladder comes
across<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.310> put<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.820> sign<00:01:18.540> here

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
across that way now you put a sign here

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.560 
across that way now you put a sign here
doesn't<00:01:20.670> need<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.880> written<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
doesn't need to be written on it you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
doesn't need to be written on it you
could<00:01:21.720> write<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.409> something<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
could write one or something for the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.910 
could write one or something for the
wrong<00:01:23.340> letter<00:01:23.610> number<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> wanted<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.920> now

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
wrong letter number if you wanted to now

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.749 
wrong letter number if you wanted to now
we're<00:01:26.070> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.759> next<00:01:27.270> rung<00:01:27.479> cap

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
we're going to go for the next rung cap

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.980 
we're going to go for the next rung cap
ron<00:01:29.759> capps<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.240> nice<00:01:31.020> music<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.900> are

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ron capps a nice music and then we are

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.850 
ron capps a nice music and then we are
going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.320> put<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> drop<00:01:35.280> shaft<00:01:35.880> break<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
going to put the drop shaft break in

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.170 
going to put the drop shaft break in
there<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.659> two<00:01:39.780> buckets

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
there now if you only have two buckets

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.620 
there now if you only have two buckets
then<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> little<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.540> more

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then it's this is a little bit more

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
then it's this is a little bit more
awkward<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> place

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
awkward you don't really want to place

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
awkward you don't really want to place
in<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> bucket<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.790> instead<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> place<00:01:48.540> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
in that bucket there instead of place in

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510 
in that bucket there instead of place in
there<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.049> you've<00:01:49.649> only<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.159> you

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
there if you've only got the two you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.660 
there if you've only got the two you
need<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.649> make<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.979> next<00:01:53.340> wrong<00:01:56.600> before<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
need to make the next wrong before you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.440 
need to make the next wrong before you
do<00:01:59.670> anything<00:01:59.790> else<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.299> can

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
do anything else because then you can

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
do anything else because then you can
head<00:02:00.570> back<00:02:00.780> down<00:02:00.990> relatively<00:02:01.979> safely<00:02:02.369> without

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
head back down relatively safely without

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.700 
head back down relatively safely without
taking<00:02:02.820> any<00:02:02.969> damage<00:02:03.200> now<00:02:04.200> what<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> need<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
taking any damage now what you need to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.990 
taking any damage now what you need to
over<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> making<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.579> infinite<00:02:05.880> water

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
over here is making an infinite water

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
over here is making an infinite water
spring<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> i'll<00:02:06.600> show<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> how<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> make<00:02:06.930> one

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
spring and i'll show you how to make one

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919 
spring and i'll show you how to make one
of<00:02:07.170> these

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.349 

if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:13.340> new<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.489> guess<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.209> need

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
if you are a new one I guess you need

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.410 
if you are a new one I guess you need
two<00:02:15.569> buckets<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.109> do<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:17.670> put<00:02:17.969> one<00:02:18.269> in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
two buckets to do this you put one in

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.209 
two buckets to do this you put one in
that<00:02:18.569> corner<00:02:18.989> one<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.530> corner<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.010> so

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
that corner one in this corner and so

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.649 
that corner one in this corner and so
long<00:02:20.310> as<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.489> fill<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.939> your<00:02:20.969> bucket<00:02:21.329> slowly

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
long as you fill up your bucket slowly

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.209 
long as you fill up your bucket slowly
you<00:02:22.260> will<00:02:22.349> have<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.590> infinite<00:02:22.799> source<00:02:23.129> of

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
you will have an infinite source of

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.589 
you will have an infinite source of
water<00:02:23.400> I've<00:02:23.670> made<00:02:23.790> loads<00:02:23.969> of<00:02:24.150> these<00:02:24.269> these<00:02:24.540> are

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
water I've made loads of these these are

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.990 
water I've made loads of these these are
all<00:02:24.780> made<00:02:24.959> with<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.409> buckets<00:02:25.769> I<00:02:26.000> using

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
all made with just two buckets I using

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.250 
all made with just two buckets I using
four<00:02:27.209> buckets<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.719> I<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.989> find<00:02:28.139> it<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
four buckets because I just find it a

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.809 
four buckets because I just find it a
bit<00:02:28.290> easier<00:02:28.409> but<00:02:28.829> you<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.159> do<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:29.639> by

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
bit easier but you can do this just by

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.479 
bit easier but you can do this just by
coming<00:02:30.000> up<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.389> down<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.569> replacing<00:02:31.439> so<00:02:31.680> head

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
coming up and down and replacing so head

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.869 
coming up and down and replacing so head
to<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.700> top<00:02:32.969> again<00:02:34.069> now<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> will<00:02:35.730> put

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
to the top again now for the will put

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.119 
to the top again now for the will put
the<00:02:35.969> drop<00:02:36.180> shot<00:02:36.359> oops<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.680> take<00:02:37.980> damage

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
the drop shot oops so you take damage

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.250 
the drop shot oops so you take damage
now<00:02:38.489> that's<00:02:38.639> when<00:02:38.760> he's<00:02:38.939> put<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.359> drop<00:02:39.989> shaft

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
now that's when he's put the drop shaft

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.629 
now that's when he's put the drop shaft
break<00:02:40.530> in<00:02:40.769> which<00:02:40.980> I'm<00:02:41.159> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.459> now

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
break in which I'm going to do now

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.140 
break in which I'm going to do now
dropped<00:02:42.209> off<00:02:42.329> break<00:02:42.599> nice<00:02:43.109> and<00:02:43.290> simple<00:02:43.760> now<00:02:44.760> we

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
dropped off break nice and simple now we

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.539 
dropped off break nice and simple now we
will<00:02:45.359> continue<00:02:45.750> with<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.560> run<00:02:46.950> cap<00:02:49.549> that's

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
will continue with a run cap that's

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.369 
will continue with a run cap that's
another<00:02:50.760> run<00:02:51.000> finish<00:02:51.359> now<00:02:51.629> I'm<00:02:52.109> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> do

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
rough a good idea was happening another

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.759 
rough a good idea was happening another
run<00:03:01.739> as<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.549> see<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.879> as<00:03:02.969> the<00:03:03.090> design

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
run as you can see that as the design

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:13.969 
run as you can see that as the design
then<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> run<00:03:05.010> cap<00:03:11.329> tada<00:03:12.680> now<00:03:13.680> when<00:03:13.859> you're

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:13.979 
then a run cap tada now when you're

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.099 
then a run cap tada now when you're
building<00:03:14.159> this<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.760> need<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.180> build<00:03:15.389> it<00:03:15.629> so

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
building this you need to build it so

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.289 
building this you need to build it so
that<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:16.590> create<00:03:16.889> a<00:03:17.220> run<00:03:17.519> at<00:03:17.729> the<00:03:17.849> very<00:03:18.030> top

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
that you create a run at the very top

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.099 
that you create a run at the very top
before<00:03:18.629> you<00:03:19.049> drop<00:03:19.290> down<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.970> start<00:03:21.109> getting

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
before you drop down and start getting

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.289 
before you drop down and start getting
water<00:03:22.470> again<00:03:22.859> because<00:03:23.639> otherwise<00:03:23.879> you're

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
water again because otherwise you're

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.339 
water again because otherwise you're
going<00:03:24.449> to<00:03:24.569> find<00:03:24.810> yourself<00:03:24.900> in<00:03:25.109> a<00:03:25.139> little

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
going to find yourself in a little

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.020 
going to find yourself in a little
pickle<00:03:25.709> because<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.310> can't<00:03:26.579> make<00:03:26.699> it<00:03:26.849> past

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
pickle because you can't make it past

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.119 
pickle because you can't make it past
our<00:03:27.150> top<00:03:27.359> blockley<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> destroy<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.439> just

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
our top blockley of the destroy it just

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.580 
our top blockley of the destroy it just
saves<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.579> time<00:03:29.819> if<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> come<00:03:30.209> prepared

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.729 

so<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> will<00:03:35.479> continue<00:03:36.479> make<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.199> more<00:03:37.470> before

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
so I will continue make one more before

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.460 
so I will continue make one more before
you<00:03:38.010> drop<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.729> get<00:03:39.180> more<00:03:39.389> water<00:03:40.669> whoops

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
you drop down and get more water whoops

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.449 
you drop down and get more water whoops
unless<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.560> do<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.919> course<00:03:43.949> oh<00:03:45.949> well<00:03:46.949> now

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
unless you do that of course oh well now

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.770 
unless you do that of course oh well now
I<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.729> get<00:03:47.849> more<00:03:48.000> water<00:03:48.120> cuz<00:03:48.419> I<00:03:48.479> got<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.629> drop

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
I can get more water cuz I got the drop

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.569 
I can get more water cuz I got the drop
shot<00:03:48.959> break<00:03:49.229> in<00:03:49.409> if<00:03:49.979> you<00:03:50.099> find<00:03:50.310> hitting<00:03:50.519> the

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
shot break in if you find hitting the

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.339 
shot break in if you find hitting the
bottom<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:50.939> fill<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.239> bucket<00:03:51.389> up<00:03:51.629> again<00:03:53.959> 24<00:03:54.959> done

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
bottom I fill my bucket up again 24 done

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.920 
bottom I fill my bucket up again 24 done
so<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.579> continue<00:03:56.879> this<00:03:57.000> method<00:03:57.509> all<00:03:57.659> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
so you can continue this method all the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.479 
so you can continue this method all the
way<00:03:58.049> up<00:03:58.079> as<00:03:58.409> high<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.799> need<00:03:59.069> this<00:03:59.250> thing<00:03:59.430> to

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
way up as high as you need this thing to

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.629 
way up as high as you need this thing to
be<00:03:59.729> it's<00:04:00.720> very<00:04:01.109> useful<00:04:01.859> because<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.069> can<00:04:02.189> you

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
be it's very useful because you can you

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.689 
be it's very useful because you can you
know<00:04:02.729> build<00:04:03.419> it<00:04:03.599> as<00:04:03.720> you're<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.019> along<00:04:04.199> and

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
know build it as you're going along and

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.179 
know build it as you're going along and
yeah<00:04:05.699> but<00:04:06.359> remember<00:04:06.629> the<00:04:06.720> thing<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:07.590> needs<00:04:08.009> to

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
yeah but remember the thing it needs to

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.399 
yeah but remember the thing it needs to
be<00:04:08.280> facing<00:04:08.549> north<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.689> exit<00:04:10.019> need<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.290> be

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
be facing north the exit need to be

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.219 
be facing north the exit need to be
facing<00:04:10.620> north<00:04:11.609> otherwise<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.780> will<00:04:13.019> not<00:04:13.199> work

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
facing north otherwise it will not work

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.409 
facing north otherwise it will not work
I<00:04:13.680> don't<00:04:13.859> know<00:04:13.919> why<00:04:14.069> it's<00:04:14.759> just<00:04:15.000> something<00:04:15.359> to

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
I don't know why it's just something to

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.420 
I don't know why it's just something to
do<00:04:15.509> the<00:04:15.599> way<00:04:15.689> the<00:04:15.780> code<00:04:15.989> ruin<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:17.070> yeah<00:04:17.190> that's

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
do the way the code ruin so yeah that's

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.430 
do the way the code ruin so yeah that's
um<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:18.329> tutorial<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.900> guys<00:04:19.079> have<00:04:19.260> any
