00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.430
 yo hello everyone on meshuggah 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.189
 and continue to watch french today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 tyazh it is rr 44 now the sixth 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.690
 the level of what has changed after bdr 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 let's talk of course with the guns more precisely 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's start talking with the gun here with us 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.960
 we have three rich choices here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 guns and they are all practically relevant 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.000
 but in addition to the top too much breakdown 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 212 at the sixth level is brute she 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 even eights lose without problems already 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.390
 sixes just to fly three pieces 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 it was possible to punch but he was horrible 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.489
 low dpm 1400 only 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.370
 and the speed of information is 34 but it is very 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 long for alpha at 240 so playing here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.399
 on so 5 mm to us 13 tr. 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 grandma we have 165 breaking 300 damage 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 subcaliber 223 penetration and damage 330 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 the storm promised to fix such shells but 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 folder is not fixed a use and land mines 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 54 break through 30 60 damage worthless slightly 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 more than completely but I drive because 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.039
 rarely ends ammunition 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.730
 this tank me and for example never 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 it was such 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.010
 most often strength ends in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.290
 In general, both are interesting because here 29 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 tyazh in this battle wormed only one 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 out. 3485 and everything else is perfect 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 such meat is straight but for the most part 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.500
 soviet and yes as you can see 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.560
 classes here are another 6 levels and in general still 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.270
 the ones that bend in general that 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.119
 talk about the tank armor he random 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.000
 brought to the forehead see 190 laptop somewhere 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 like this 170 180 acute angle well rhombus 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.009
 such 190 and this is the main problem 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.470
 because the average breakthrough t t 6 level 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.509
 just 170 that is, the top will fall out 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 you will not be struck on the bottom bar 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.280
 it's just random you can't do anything 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.710
 affect him and by the way we have 60 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960
 millimeters undisguised caterpillar let's 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.659
 conductive shot square-3 yes and let's see here they are 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.689
 here are the boards they are covered tracks 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.479
 body and tracks attack from above and this is even 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.850
 bathing is a model it is not in this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.369
 huge art problem just mercilessly 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.140
 to punish this tank in addition to the board 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.149
 uncovered by the caterpillars we also 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.599
 towers of 30 millimeters on all sides 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.879
 except forehead and forehead 120 sheer plus 70 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.210
 mask do you know how many will be the same 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.870
 most 190 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.630
 ie square-85 Dan 170 breakout 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.550
 just throws in the forehead and your silhouette 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.470
 he has equal chances to punch you like not 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.630
 punch so you don't do this 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.110
 the main problem of this tank and I even 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.180
 look after several fights I replaced 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.860
 the usual first-aid kit on gold because with 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 landmine die two to three members 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.090
 crew per per shot I already had 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.470
 such cases after them just me 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.780
 put the first-aid kit 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.120
 here also happy don't know about it 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 but in principle 60 already almost all 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 rolled out say for the equipment is 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.620
 rammer of course reinforced drives 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.900
 crosstalk and stereo why why 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.910
 overview 300 motive 20 meters no lie 330 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.790
 it is even by the standards of the fifth level 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.160
 Fuck quite review and only for the sixth 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.890
 levels is just a sentence therefore 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.630
 only pipes with no options here 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.790
 we see that by 3 black prince 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.430
 distracted by someone I am leaving through 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 veins give someone a third do not even pay 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.510
 attention to poke from will of prince to 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.910
 Unfortunately only 12 damage well, until I 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.600
 everything was shorn about everything 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.990
 could owen by the way have a good tank -9 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.630
 minus 10 plus 15 05 they are hard because 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.790
 the towers are sheer cardboard just to get into 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.520
 it doesnâ€™t really break through 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.160
 labor in general we go to the welfare of the prince 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.530
 even if not even trying to break it in 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160
 forehead promise overboard and here it is already calm 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.710
 throw on 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.660
 m6 meanwhile having fun and throwing 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.300
 I am of course on board and you see even 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.880
 vld breaks not too shy 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 you he finish hits on this god perhaps 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.230
 ended for me if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.300
 here everything will be taken away without me by the way 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.970
 look to d 9 seconds in principle 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.830
 ok thats just before class nerf i 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.990
 managed to shoot for one of his shell 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.030
 threw him in 2000 if discharged almost 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.010
 at the same time with him probably was 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 some kind of plus and fetish of this 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.230
 tank 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.780
 and now let's see the result turned out 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.910
 carry a little less than two thousand damage 29 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.489
 even someone dedicated is just a sign 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.039
 klassnost master without any medals 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.199
 on the team played and extremely well 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.930
 how to say a shower here is first among 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.180
 but almost equal but few stuffed 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.789
 much less i'm here my normal 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.039
 played with the sevens and the water in the top by 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.250
 Damage ahead a little bit ahead of 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.229
 a second bit of pure you 1112 experience 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.990
 plank on the master would say well so-so 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:44.349
 generally straight generally straight so- so 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.270
 I have chanted here well 780 by some miracle 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.340
 well you would epam you yourself I have already seen 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.440
 said what exactly is skill here 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.509
 tank impossible but went away plus 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.310
 one thousand because I shot gold 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.289
 Gold does more and wanted to 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.229
 podamazhit more without a premium account 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.590
 went to minus 11 almost 500 which is basically 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.539
 not very good but not critical well 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.310
 I will not summarize the tank 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.740
 because another video is coming soon 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.900
 where probably already give such a detailed 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.069
 analytics and here we are so primary 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.370
 talked well and look at 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.930
 quite an interesting fight gave 29 hell 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.580
 of what the video was here 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.349
 interesting with you was meshuggah before 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.340
 See you soon and good luck in the random 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.340
 is happy 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.930
 and
