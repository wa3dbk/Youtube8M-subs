00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.939
 ah 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.939
 two 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 or 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.750
 this was the truth the only and secret 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.790
 true that July 21, 1969 a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.159
 our ni aldrin went away scarce 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.510
 meters of the module filming this 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.420
 incredible construction 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.680
 this 14 minute movie was never 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.680
 spread by nothing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.150
 redbird was one of the few 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.320
 Americans who had access to it 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.300
 a few meters from life and it was not 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.400
 chance 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.400
 everything was meticulously programmed 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.079
 these mysterious ruins like other 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.570
 equally filmed by the remaining a 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.610
 poles had been photographed with 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.690
 anteriority by the different probes 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.410
 automatic 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.659
 one of them the surveyor 5 released on 8 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.119
 September 1967 was decisive 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.479
 It landed in the sea of â€‹â€‹tranquility very 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.319
 near this construction sending 19 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.319
 thousand pictures 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.550
 buildings in ruins of buildings in the 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.790
 surface of the moon buildings 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.850
 apparently of a great antiquity 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 but who had raised them 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.720
 we humans obviously do not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.900
 there was only one answer 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.900
 it was the work of a non-human civilization 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.090
 to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.959
 do not 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 i 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.549
 why 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.590
 ah 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.830
 yes 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.890
 the military had satisfied the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.180
 first part of his big devilish 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.180
 now there was the second 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.830
 you 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.700
 plus 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.700
 ah 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.540
 ah 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.470
 um 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.030
 in second and confident the astronauts 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.760
 proceeded to what was scheduled they picked 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.480
 samples of the walls took measurements and 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.480
 they retired 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.150
 the unusual construction very similar to 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.910
 a hangar was 60 meters long 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.319
 with a maximum height in the walls of 9 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.330
 meters 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.330
 had 12 holes or windows and one 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.750
 kind of front door of 5 meters of 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.120
 background by 3 height 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.100
 according to the analyzes carried out in the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.440
 ground the material that had been 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.310
 built was similar to that of the 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.580
 lunar surface 60% of the atoms 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.410
 it was oxygen with 0.01 percent of the 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.410
 weight constituted by hydrogen 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.360
 and the walls were very 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.790
 eroded this circumstance has given 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.560
 that the moon does not exist practically 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.810
 atmosphere made the military think 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.370
 that the building in question could have 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.370
 several thousand years 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.110
 the secret armstrong excursion and 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.840
 aldrin to this hangar and naturally the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.099
 14 minutes of film were never 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.099
 disseminated by birth
