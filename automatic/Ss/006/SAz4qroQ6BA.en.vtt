00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
incredible nuance to it to some people

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.539 
incredible nuance to it to some people
it's<00:01:12.139> just<00:01:12.200> something<00:01:12.560> about<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:13.009> big<00:01:13.340> deal

but the people who are possessed

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.879 
but the people who are possessed
there<00:01:16.969> is<00:01:17.179> nuance<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.869> there<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.380> different

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
there is nuance and there is different

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:20.379

showing<00:01:23.029> that<00:01:23.119> if<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.539> just<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.899> hand<00:01:24.139> maybe

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
showing that if it's just a hand maybe

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.800 
showing that if it's just a hand maybe
that's<00:01:24.709> too<00:01:24.979> much<00:01:25.100> concealment<00:01:25.729> if<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.600> got<00:01:26.779> a

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
that's too much concealment if you got a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.510 
that's too much concealment if you got a
bunch<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.289> little<00:01:27.529> bits<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:27.979> pieces<00:01:28.039> coming

my<00:01:50.760> major<00:01:51.030> consideration<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.870> I<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.230> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
my major consideration that I think is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.070 
my major consideration that I think is
the<00:01:52.410> most<00:01:52.530> important<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.340> light<00:01:53.580> I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
the most important thing is the light I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.930 
the most important thing is the light I
love<00:01:55.080> back<00:01:55.320> light<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.190> like<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.580> when<00:01:56.730> a

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
love back light I like I like it when a

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
love back light I like I like it when a
subject<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.660> directly<00:01:58.050> lit<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> light<00:01:58.890> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
subject is directly lit and the light is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.130 
subject is directly lit and the light is
like<00:01:59.070> early<00:01:59.520> morning<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.000> late<00:02:00.960> afternoon

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like early morning or late afternoon

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
like early morning or late afternoon
although<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.830> definitely<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.910> stay<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.210> as

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
although I definitely don't stay out as

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
although I definitely don't stay out as
late<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.840> should<00:02:04.050> as<00:02:04.260> often<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:04.770> should

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
late as I should as often as I should

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
late as I should as often as I should
but<00:02:05.610> big-government<00:02:06.510> how<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.870> set<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.350> shots

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
but big-government how I set up my shots

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.590 
but big-government how I set up my shots
I'd<00:02:07.920> say<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.850> foremost<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> light

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
I'd say first and foremost is the light

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.630 
I'd say first and foremost is the light
and<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> seems<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.310> skiing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
and then you know it seems like skiing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.270 
and then you know it seems like skiing
photography<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.540> easy<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
photography would be easy but the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.920 
photography would be easy but the
intersection<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> all<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
intersection of all the all the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.040 
intersection of all the all the
variables<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.730> far<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.880> few<00:02:18.060> between<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
variables is far and few between you

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050 
variables is far and few between you
really<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.740> form<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> skier<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.790> so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
really like the form of the skier is so

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.780 
really like the form of the skier is so
important<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.870> you'll<00:02:22.440> find<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.980> one

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
important and you'll find like one

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.570 
important and you'll find like one
moment<00:02:24.030> where<00:02:24.900> they're<00:02:25.200> on<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.920> then<00:02:26.130> you

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
moment where they're on it and then you

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.520 
moment where they're on it and then you
know<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.120> other<00:02:27.300> frame<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.050> camera<00:02:28.200> does

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
know of the other frame the camera does

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.970 
know of the other frame the camera does
not<00:02:28.560> lie

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
not lie

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:39.260 
not lie
the<00:02:29.370> camera<00:02:29.730> will<00:02:29.850> never<00:02:30.150> lie<00:02:38.120> sometimes<00:02:39.120> you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the camera will never lie sometimes you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.600 
the camera will never lie sometimes you
are<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.930> letting<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.350> athletes<00:02:41.190> do<00:02:41.459> what
