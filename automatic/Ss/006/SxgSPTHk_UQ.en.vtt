indeed<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.859> like<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.099> Pearl<00:02:06.459> that<00:02:06.729> it's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
indeed just like the Pearl that it's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.180 
indeed just like the Pearl that it's
named<00:02:07.119> after<00:02:07.359> we<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.349> camera<00:02:08.739> shutter<00:02:08.950> key

as<00:02:09.340> well<00:02:09.489> as<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.640> linear<00:02:09.879> cord<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:11.230> think<00:02:11.739> to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
as well as a linear cord and I think to

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.880 
as well as a linear cord and I think to
know<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.870> version<00:02:14.290> it's<00:02:14.650> very

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
know is that on this version it's very

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.740 
know is that on this version it's very
insight<00:02:15.190> weight<00:02:15.430> as<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.239> all<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> pro<00:02:16.720> version

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

so<00:02:17.349> we<00:02:17.560> certainly<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.220> footprint<00:02:18.700> that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
so we certainly like the footprint that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
so we certainly like the footprint that
the<00:02:19.390> device<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.769> car<00:02:20.980> screen
