00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 and now you know what the number 13 is and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:16.859
 why is she not 12000 how did it happen 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.990
 that everyone around is afraid Friday 13 not 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.699
 sit down at number 13 in the cinema and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.380
 call it all the damn dozen 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.380
 It is obvious that from ignorance the number 13 is still with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 old times associated with bad luck 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.980
 Europeans try to avoid him 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.989
 russia call this number damn 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 Is it really a dozen 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.910
 bad as they say try to figure out 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 Russia is mostly Orthodox 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 country and in Orthodoxy the number 13 is normal 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.149
 number and fear of it is just superstition 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 for example in Judaism the number 13 is happy 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.160
 same as maya 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.469
 where does fear come from in europe 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.750
 some horseradish number 13 in europe 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 unhappy and if superstition is in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.219
 Europe it is in America check it out here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 such is nonsense in most hotels 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.619
 Europe and America there is no 13 floor 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.689
 for the twelfth immediately goes 14 to you what 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 it's really so calmer you don't care 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.250
 you are on the 13th floor 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.990
 You lost a moron piece in theaters and beyond 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.119
 for example there is no place with this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
 number a in ships after 12 cabin 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.369
 immediately goes the same 14 in airplanes 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 some say that maybe number 13 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.510
 unhappy just because she 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.340
 greater than the sacred number 12 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.310
 but there are twelve apostles all things and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.690
 that now all that more than 12 is not bad 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 all in the picture yes vinci last supper 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.220
 at the table depicts 13 people so what 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.590
 and everything after that exists 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.140
 it is a complete belief that if 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.820
 13 people will gather at the same table 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.820
 one of them will die within a year 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.570
 uglich 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.980
 damn us our example of 12 people came 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.760
 already in de lancy there is like in 13 oak 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 up to 2 we already have 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.860
 so when did this fear appear 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.769
 presumably in the middle ages just 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 in Italy when tarot cards appeared 13 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.500
 card grim reaper of death and everything is simple 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.420
 coincided 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
 and what if the manufacturer would deliver 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.910
 death card on the number for example 32 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:09.209
 Friday thirty second somehow not really 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:12.900
 It sounds today is Friday the 13th you 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.700
 die i kill you just come on you don't 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.700
 you will make excuses up to 10 mm fridays 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.500
 13 is all a fairy tale for children sense 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.799
 In general, an ordinary day is usually the same as 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.750
 everything 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:27.299
 No, he wanted to scare the kids 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.019
 these fables i actually don't believe now 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.540
 hang up 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:36.930
 I put my friend only here on the moon 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.310

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.310

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.109
 super combo from number 13 and friday 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.470
 Friday 13 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:53.280
 Well, type for those who are weak in the beads 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.380
 strength since the end of the nineteenth 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.260
 century friday was considered the day of executioner 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.320
 then on Friday 13 for sure everyone will rest 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.400
 fear of this number is called cod and 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.130
 dk phobia 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.260
 and the fear of friday 13 is called 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.260
 skydd parade 3b 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.049
 parasq vidiq 3f parasq view of 1 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.400
 Parasca Riddick 3 and phobia and I 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.250
 for example stenosis 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.440
 from they are phobia this will go narrowing the screen 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:27.710
 so what 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 but in general, then figured out or not adore 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.930
 conspiracy theories therefore drifted on 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.240
 a feeling that america knows what it is 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.950
 number some funny and use 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.810
 her to the fullest the more you him 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.370
 insert somewhere so you cooler but with 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.930
 this proves to everyone that it is not so 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.110
 probably so that others do not use 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.510
 give an example of an eagle on the coat of arms of the usa has 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.240
 on each wing 13 feathers per paw 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.970
 he has 13 leaves and olives in another 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.390
 a bunch of 13 arrows was originally 13 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.780
 states 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.510
 and the motto consisted of 13 letters and when 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.630
 raised the flag sounded salute precisely from 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.580
 13 volleys but if the number 13 is so cool 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.750
 here's what the movie should look like 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.340
 friday 13 good morning hi still full 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.410
 idiot is finding a match 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.910
 disasters with this number all at once 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.320
 forget that they can happen 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.810
 every day yesterday during the flood died 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.630
 18 thousand people there is no survivor 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.180
 doctors Thursday the plane fell right on the house 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.770
 there are no poor African children 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.000

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.890

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.890
 in which world we live you heard 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.590
 Satan's tricks and what if 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.970
 Friday 13 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.650
 it's the same day as everyone else 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.640
 by the way in England was originally not 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.100
 Baker's dozen 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.070

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.080

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.950
 I want to believe for free in Russia 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.240
 there is also such an action but I believe with 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.240
