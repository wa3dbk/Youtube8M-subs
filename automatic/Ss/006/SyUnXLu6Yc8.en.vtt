 interested parties should enter the site or by title 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 everywhere I go 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.309
 if at some point in history 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.759
 politics 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.739
 someone 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.409
 have title 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.909
 the vice president 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.160
 respect and awareness change 18 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.789
 we 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.210
 we do not have divergences with explicit attention 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.890
 we were partners 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.530
 I feel bad moments 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.620
 we do what we understand that Brazil 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.990
 need 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 which is done by the slightly further left of the ps 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 for him I became a more conservative syndicalist the businessman 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.020
 more 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 there was more lefty he 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.330
 but hard on the fall 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.230
 And that's when I think it was good, Brazil. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.340
 It was good for me. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.310
 I think it was good for him. 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.860
 I think it was a bit like that. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.880
 I'll tell a story 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.940
 to end with a story 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.840
 this morning 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620
 while I'm going to setúbal 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.090
 And I was taking Josue with that conversation from your house. 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 still in 2000 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.490
 had not even gotten to the elections 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.200
 and I went to dinner at the house of José I said that it was 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.920
 the doctor olavo setúbal 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.000
 roberto setúbal 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.450
 a conversation 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.890
 we started to talk there 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.970
 and then the doctor in Setubal started asking if 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.600
 promise to catch the goal 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.690
 What will one do with one of the agrarian conflicts financed account 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.149
 and I was telling the other side our program computes that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 on the other side 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 prevented you will not let 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 is to ask something else I answered the other thing 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.049
 the producer 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.049
 the empire will not let 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:17.900
 I know what it was 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 four questions four answers empire a taboo leaving to do nothing 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.269
 the project in the decision-making of the people 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.569
 but it was late 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.859
 I knew that the prostitute who controls 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.509
 I want to know 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:35.879
 since april 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.879
 to mention that this is it 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.449
 lacked a white goal that the behavior 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.609
 patriot that period 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.609
 the olavo doctor 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:57.219
 took a fright 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.069
 the sml distinct flights of joy was also tired of both internal tv 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.549
 and it is true that the history of Brazil take a little and took a lot of weight 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.219
 and have a paw the people who believed that peters not leaving the 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.129
 power leaving at a power 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.280
 and I think with men like zé alencar who came before us 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.379
 who had the courage to face the project 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.389
 that we can take important steps 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.529
 so paulo I think fia explains 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.819
 did an extraordinary time 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.819
 doing this homage 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.979
 I honestly know a lot of people. 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.159
 and the unfortunate situation of the green that the table of maximum prices 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.609
 the years go from 31 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.629
 Now I'll tell you about our lives, they're locked up. 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.249
 what counts in our lives I do not know how you insisted 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.779
 but that fellow at the edge of the stove where to go 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:02.129
 saying of Galicia that you like 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.719
 to style 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.669
 more people are coming 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.969
 of the 5th speech symposium in the Egyptian parliament 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.619
 the estimate is that even the tie-break and people's lives 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.010
 because all of us and that all of us here are partners 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.130
 We think you have many friends but when you want 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.099
 synthesizing 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.509
 You count on the fingers of your hand. 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.080

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.169
 in the time of lean cows 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.169
 than in the fat cows 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.969
