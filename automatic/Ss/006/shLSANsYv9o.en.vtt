I could push my hands against the sides

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.350 
I could push my hands against the sides
of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> door<00:02:01.619> frame<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.549> could<00:02:02.759> climb<00:02:03.090> up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of the door frame and I could climb up

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
of the door frame and I could climb up
that<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> door<00:02:04.409> frame<00:02:04.649> by<00:02:04.860> pushing<00:02:05.100> very

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

high and climb up and I remember

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.910 
high and climb up and I remember
thinking<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.479> might<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.660> spider-man<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.770> it

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
thinking I might be spider-man like it

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.710 
thinking I might be spider-man like it
wasn't<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.340> wasn't<00:02:11.520> completely<00:02:12.180> out<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
wasn't it wasn't completely out of the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.100 
wasn't it wasn't completely out of the
realm<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
realm of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.210 
realm of
possibility<00:02:13.470> i<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:13.740> actually<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.190> fact

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
possibility i was actually in fact

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.660 
possibility i was actually in fact
spider-man<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.230> remember<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.770> that

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
spider-man and so I remember like that
