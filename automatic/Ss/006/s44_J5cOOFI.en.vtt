is cheesy so let's see what I can do
with<00:01:55.829> Michael<00:01:56.219> Vick<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.640> personally<00:01:57.299> think

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
with Michael Vick I personally think

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
with Michael Vick I personally think
Michael<00:01:57.990> Vick<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.229> significantly<00:01:58.829> cheesier

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
Michael Vick is significantly cheesier

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
Michael Vick is significantly cheesier
but<00:01:59.579> we'll<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.149> happens<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:01.350> he

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
but we'll see what happens I know he

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
but we'll see what happens I know he
doesn't<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.860> trucking<00:02:02.340> attributes<00:02:02.790> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
doesn't have the trucking attributes and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.370 
doesn't have the trucking attributes and
that<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.270> stuff<00:02:03.329> brake<00:02:03.810> tackled

Walter<00:02:04.799> Payton<00:02:05.130> does<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.479> he's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Walter Payton does but I think he's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.120
