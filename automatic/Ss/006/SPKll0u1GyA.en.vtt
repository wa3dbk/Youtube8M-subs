 before his performances so that has 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.960
 it is important to push the resources down and not only on the ground 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.540
 his better side all the time though they refuse sometimes it happens though 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.429
 Nevertheless, then discovered the Tancock Mayer and 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.900
 Century are sometimes thoughtful even if you do not like that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.770
 really mountain view to year the paper already seen from Hamburg 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.909
 yes of choice 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.370
 but a bit sad at the Alster 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.760
 and find work in a climbing park 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.870
 so is a very nice environment data are very nice people i have to 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.549
 Actually, pumps are also currently moving around 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.999
 just to get 

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:52.709
 I was really hurt to be with the girls now too 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.100
 So live m the market is very nice 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.840
 it gave him a short moment the best the pope that one quits there 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.700
 do not explain why or why 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.720
 we really admire it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.639
 and to occupy that is I pack food I want to reach that goal 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.729
 the power is given 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.629
 the Hertener m 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.379
 Of course, the girls given by the force it is really around 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:22.659
 and of course my mom also gave me strength because she was the farthest 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:23.649
 also make 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:27.099
 sitting in a sidebar shadow measured the band is always commenting 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.429
 not be clarified 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.399
 who certainly also pulled the power also spatially my whole family 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.709
 "I would not have expected them either 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.599
 I do not like to thank you "We have to make a big difference to the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.280
 tape 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 thanks be made thanks to losers 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.800
 Vienna in one thing it is not the first time is that the two 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.450
 Popstars is rushed 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.450
 until the heartiest hides behind you 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.560
 I do not know exactly how I've always been that way since I was so 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.069
 I can imagine this dream that I want to be on stage 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.650
 and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.649
 have a lot to start dancing 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:06.699
 and he since then as a ship 1 do my job that not interested 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.469
 you have to be successful in the new piece 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.059
 So Queensberry in itself is more really great stuff so something for 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.649
 we were like never before 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.180
 in Germany 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.820
 That's why I do not want to compare hotter 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.929
 Card use can of course 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.999
 Sympathy made and we admire him one last lead to successor 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.499
 but leave us alone but go your own way you mean he just 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.739
 that the Queensberry are something new 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 in which the right one distinguishes the other groups 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.920
 I do not know exactly how to define it, but we're just around 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.520
 one from Josephine 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.689
 something completely new to the KAP Hermann way found 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.019
 in order to give Vivienne a completely new direction we can combine quite simply 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.349
 Tore pop music with some sixties-pop sounds from the sixties 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.519
 get everything measured 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.699
 a critic we think we just do what we want 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.510
 Antonella you are now on counter tour fasting 20 hours 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.399
 together 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:08.309
 There is something that admires the other and there is something hasty 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:09.989
 take another 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.049
 So MS Nile admire average than us 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.400
 all of them gain new strength over and over again motivating us all 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.900
 Do not laugh and be in a good mood and we'll do that too 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.319
 two three weeks together 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.360
 not easy 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 it just suits us, we are curious 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.979
 H 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.330
 H 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.099
 the company trains the daily weekly 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.180
 that's very intense of course, of course we want that's a great show 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.670
 becomes 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.830
 one is definitely several hours 8 hours sometimes longer 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.080
 sometimes it seems like he has that we will not know where it is 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.949
 The artists are currently going on tour classics there of a well-known 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.809
 Routes Bank of America 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.619
 now the native man's year gives elaborate productions how far 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:28.379
 this development as Smirnoff proceeded around this group the Coasters 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.100
 the cards have come together again 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.169
 to develop this staging 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.349
 yes, I would put them on because it is one percent all 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.930
 Developers positive from it percent hold us in demand 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.770
 this would be a strong part Bernd also here in Germany "That is 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.720
 the strongest group and of course Country Head Percent but got 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.080
 we asked ourselves he will give us more of the foot we will have 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.650
 because of course RWE have a pinch of Enzi in Germany 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.470
 a very high quality and roughly mourning for having them 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.479
 at the zoo and more natural we have saved with plates from 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:05.759
 only around the whole 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.569
 Teams and have that in the Swiss their developments and built up and the 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.009
 now the Kunsthalle is firmly participating in what Ernst w 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.479
 ca 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:57.639
 but 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.990
 also 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.910
