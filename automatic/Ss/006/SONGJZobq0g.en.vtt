any<00:02:49.430> more<00:02:49.550> problem<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.030> gonna<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.330> like<00:02:50.480> a

people see in us absolutely we both have

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.420 
people see in us absolutely we both have
a<00:04:22.460> dynamic<00:04:22.910> inside<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.889> energy<00:04:24.889> it's<00:04:25.340> not

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
a dynamic inside like energy it's not

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.210 
a dynamic inside like energy it's not
about<00:04:25.729> how<00:04:25.970> fast<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.510> do<00:04:26.750> but<00:04:27.320> how<00:04:27.560> much<00:04:27.919> you

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
about how fast you do but how much you

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280 
about how fast you do but how much you
can<00:04:28.370> control<00:04:28.850> yourself<00:04:29.419> how<00:04:29.630> much<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:29.930> can

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
can control yourself how much you can

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.180 
can control yourself how much you can
create<00:04:30.850> different<00:04:32.139> energy<00:04:33.139> rhythm<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.949> I

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
create different energy rhythm and I

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.250 
create different energy rhythm and I
think<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.520> both<00:04:34.699> have<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.360> sometimes<00:04:36.110> you

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
think we both have it and sometimes you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.650 
think we both have it and sometimes you
want<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.440> challenge<00:04:36.740> me<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.280> know<00:04:38.090> it's<00:04:38.539> a

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
want to challenge me you know it's a

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.540 
want to challenge me you know it's a
great<00:04:38.900> development<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.710> would<00:04:40.130> record<00:04:40.430> that

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
great development with would record that

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.980 
great development with would record that
because<00:04:40.940> he<00:04:41.180> has<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.690> much<00:04:41.840> power<00:04:42.169> so<00:04:42.590> much

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
because he has so much power so much

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.469 
because he has so much power so much
knowledge<00:04:44.990> also<00:04:45.320> for<00:04:45.860> me<00:04:45.979> was<00:04:46.220> very<00:04:46.520> big

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
knowledge also for me was very big

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.040 
knowledge also for me was very big
challenge<00:04:49.300> that's<00:04:50.300> true<00:04:50.539> yes<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.340> now<00:04:52.340> we<00:04:52.400> are

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
challenge that's true yes and now we are

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.870 
challenge that's true yes and now we are
very<00:04:54.050> much<00:04:54.289> developing<00:04:54.860> also<00:04:55.010> partnership<00:04:55.729> as

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
very much developing also partnership as

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.629 
very much developing also partnership as
a<00:04:55.910> woman<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.479> man<00:04:57.100> well<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.280> course<00:04:58.340> we're

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
a woman and man well of course we're

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.219 
a woman and man well of course we're
going<00:04:58.789> to<00:04:58.850> be<00:04:58.940> always<00:04:59.090> men<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.720> women<00:05:00.020> but

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
going to be always men and women but

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.360 
going to be always men and women but
still<00:05:00.560> approach<00:05:01.400> of<00:05:01.960> muscular<00:05:02.960> and<00:05:03.370> very

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
still approach of muscular and very

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.210 
still approach of muscular and very
feminine<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.780> well<00:05:06.500> is<00:05:06.620> difficult<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.070> say

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
feminine so well is difficult to say

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.590 
feminine so well is difficult to say
also<00:05:07.370> because<00:05:07.760> it's<00:05:07.910> just<00:05:08.150> four<00:05:08.330> year<00:05:08.449> we

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
also because it's just four year we

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.469 
also because it's just four year we
dance<00:05:08.750> together<00:05:09.039> and<00:05:10.039> at<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:10.970> beginning<00:05:11.060> when

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
dance together and at the beginning when

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.020 
dance together and at the beginning when
their<00:05:11.690> coaches<00:05:12.200> was<00:05:12.380> telling<00:05:12.680> us<00:05:12.830> in<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.220> 3<00:05:13.789> or<00:05:13.880> 4

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
their coaches was telling us in a 3 or 4

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.360 
their coaches was telling us in a 3 or 4
years<00:05:14.210> time<00:05:14.419> you<00:05:14.599> will<00:05:14.750> see<00:05:14.960> how<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.650> male<00:05:16.070> 2

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
years time you will see how you male 2

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.210 
years time you will see how you male 2
together<00:05:16.729> we<00:05:17.300> were<00:05:17.419> thinking<00:05:18.349> like<00:05:18.380> well

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
together we were thinking like well

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.430 
together we were thinking like well
three<00:05:20.060> four<00:05:20.330> years<00:05:20.599> so<00:05:20.870> one<00:05:21.020> year<00:05:21.200> should<00:05:21.380> be

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
three four years so one year should be

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.900 
three four years so one year should be
the<00:05:21.590> same<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.370> different

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
the same it's different

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.700 
the same it's different
now<00:05:23.539> we<00:05:23.599> start<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.110> feel<00:05:24.260> more<00:05:24.380> comfortable

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
now we start to feel more comfortable

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.879 
now we start to feel more comfortable
with<00:05:24.919> each<00:05:24.950> other<00:05:25.270> we<00:05:26.270> know<00:05:26.450> each<00:05:26.630> other<00:05:26.889> yeah

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
with each other we know each other yeah

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.350 
with each other we know each other yeah
we<00:05:28.190> know<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.460> good<00:05:28.610> or<00:05:28.729> bad<00:05:28.820> things<00:05:29.060> of<00:05:29.240> each

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.200 
other
I<00:05:31.060> like<00:05:32.060> Yulia<00:05:32.870> Russian<00:05:33.440> side<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.830> Yulia<00:05:34.220> she

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
I like Yulia Russian side of Yulia she

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.540 
I like Yulia Russian side of Yulia she
deal<00:05:35.389> with<00:05:35.419> my<00:05:35.720> Italian<00:05:35.960> side<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.800> think<00:05:37.250> that

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
deal with my Italian side I think that

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:54.339 
deal with my Italian side I think that
is<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.880> characteristic<00:05:38.780> probably<00:05:53.349> working

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
is the characteristic probably working

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.310 
is the characteristic probably working
of<00:05:54.800> Russian<00:05:55.250> laziness<00:05:56.180> of<00:05:56.300> my<00:05:56.479> Italian<00:05:56.720> side
