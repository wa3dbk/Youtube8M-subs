version I'll show you the difference as

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.410 
version I'll show you the difference as
we<00:00:28.910> go

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
we go

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.529

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
probably will so what this is most you

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.810 
probably will so what this is most you
know<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.410> time<00:00:36.590> lapse<00:00:36.859> is<00:00:37.129> that's<00:00:37.550> where<00:00:37.730> it

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
know what time lapse is that's where it

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.590 
know what time lapse is that's where it
takes<00:00:37.970> photograph<00:00:39.040> every<00:00:40.120> whatever<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.329> want

maybe three seconds ten seconds one

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.420 
maybe three seconds ten seconds one
minute<00:00:44.840> one<00:00:45.050> day<00:00:45.290> it's<00:00:45.920> got<00:00:46.130> all<00:00:46.280> those

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
minute one day it's got all those

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.610 
minute one day it's got all those
settings<00:00:47.020> unfortunately<00:00:48.020> my<00:00:48.230> screen

recorder<00:00:49.329> interferes<00:00:50.329> with<00:00:50.780> me<00:00:51.130> making<00:00:52.130> a

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
recorder interferes with me making a

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.340 
recorder interferes with me making a
video<00:00:52.640> at<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.850> same<00:00:52.880> time<00:00:53.329> as<00:00:53.630> recording<00:00:54.170> us

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
video at the same time as recording us

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.770 
video at the same time as recording us
so<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.190> won't<00:00:55.520> be<00:00:55.700> able<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.910> do<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:56.270> but<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:56.480> can

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
so I won't be able to do that but I can

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.979 
so I won't be able to do that but I can
show<00:00:57.110> you<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.820> quick<00:00:58.820> clip<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:59.300> what<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.870> would

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
show you a quick clip of what it would

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.020 
show you a quick clip of what it would
look<00:01:00.230> like<00:01:00.290> if<00:01:00.770> when<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.100> make<00:01:01.340> something<00:01:01.670> you

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
look like if when you make something you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.520 
look like if when you make something you
know<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:03.590> is<00:01:03.800> my<00:01:03.980> aquarium<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:05.930> 65

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
know this is my aquarium this is 65

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.870 
know this is my aquarium this is 65
photographs<00:01:07.130> as<00:01:07.399> you<00:01:07.579> can<00:01:07.759> see<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:10.460> just<00:01:10.640> set

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
photographs as you can see you just set

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.510 
photographs as you can see you just set
your<00:01:11.030> interval<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.720> then<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.650> move<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.250> camera

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
your interval and then I move the camera

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.980 
your interval and then I move the camera
around<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:14.000> little<00:01:14.270> too<00:01:14.450> quick

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
around a little too quick

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.270 
around a little too quick
you<00:01:15.229> should<00:01:15.440> really<00:01:15.590> move<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:15.979> around<00:01:16.070> a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
you should really move it around a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.950 
you should really move it around a
little<00:01:16.310> slower<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.220> at<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:20.600> frame<00:01:20.930> per

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
little slower this is at one frame per

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.030 
little slower this is at one frame per
three<00:01:21.590> seconds<00:01:22.869> however<00:01:23.869> it<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.320> total<00:01:24.830> blue

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
three seconds however it is total blue

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.960 
three seconds however it is total blue
totally<00:01:25.990> customizable<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:28.159> also<00:01:28.400> you

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
totally customizable so and also you

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.560 
totally customizable so and also you
decide<00:01:29.960> how<00:01:30.140> you're<00:01:30.380> gonna<00:01:31.000> finish<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.299> like<00:01:32.450> I

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
decide how you're gonna finish it like I

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.320 
decide how you're gonna finish it like I
can<00:01:32.750> speed<00:01:33.049> it<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.320> there<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.119> but<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:35.210> was

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
can speed it up there so but it was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.260 
can speed it up there so but it was
recorded<00:01:35.900> at<00:01:36.049> three<00:01:36.799> frames<00:01:37.130> or<00:01:37.729> one<00:01:38.060> frame

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
recorded at three frames or one frame

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.440 
recorded at three frames or one frame
every<00:01:38.390> three<00:01:38.720> seconds<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:40.070> speed<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.850> way<00:01:41.030> up

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
every three seconds but speed it way up

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.870 
every three seconds but speed it way up
or<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.140> can<00:01:42.320> slow<00:01:42.650> it<00:01:42.680> right<00:01:43.070> down<00:01:43.369> just<00:01:43.759> to

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
or you can slow it right down just to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.300 
or you can slow it right down just to
individual<00:01:44.479> frames<00:01:44.840> one<00:01:45.170> frame<00:01:45.439> per<00:01:45.650> second

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.170 

so<00:01:49.310> somewhere<00:01:49.970> anyway<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.780> pretty<00:01:51.020> cool<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
so somewhere anyway it's pretty cool the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.890 
so somewhere anyway it's pretty cool the
size

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
size

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.690 
size
seems<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.409> be<00:01:54.439> determined<00:01:55.070> by<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.189> size<00:01:55.490> of

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
seems to be determined by the size of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
seems to be determined by the size of
your<00:01:56.200> memory<00:01:57.200> on<00:01:57.350> your<00:01:57.380> phone<00:01:57.770> or<00:01:58.659> iPad<00:01:59.659> I

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
your memory on your phone or iPad I

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.670 
your memory on your phone or iPad I
guess<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:02.810> fit<00:02:03.140> quite<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> bit<00:02:03.590> of

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
guess so you can fit quite a bit of

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.980 
guess so you can fit quite a bit of
pictures<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.040> if<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:04.549> have<00:02:04.759> like<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.149> have<00:02:05.329> a<00:02:05.360> 32

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
pictures so if you have like I have a 32

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.100 
pictures so if you have like I have a 32
gigabyte<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:07.430> I<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.729> fit<00:02:07.939> quite<00:02:08.689> a<00:02:08.720> bit<00:02:08.929> on

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
gigabyte so I can fit quite a bit on

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.770 
gigabyte so I can fit quite a bit on
there<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.120> really<00:02:11.120> could<00:02:11.299> just<00:02:11.450> set<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.689> up

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
there so you really could just set it up

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.220 
there so you really could just set it up
all<00:02:11.959> day<00:02:11.989> taking<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.010> picture<00:02:13.400> every<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:15.200> know

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
