00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.200
 kitchen chapter in minutes the new 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 channel 8 program today we will be 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.910
 preparing sweet and sour chicken wings 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:21.359
 ginger and garlic activate it the line was 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.320
 running in flight to stop him for 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.320
 paper 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.480
 we will order everything to start from 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.250
 simple way the chicken the flour the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.830
 salt and pepper we leave everything well 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.480
 prepared and the first thing we do is 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.580
 enter the chicken inside two bags 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.980
 plastic supermarket 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.890
 clean and this is where we're going to start 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.800
 to spice up what we want a bit of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.590
 pepper to taste after this you 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.100
 add a little salt 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.710
 and we started to flavor this chicken from 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.140
 little bit now let's throw a few drops 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.200
 a teaspoon of sesame oil a 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.180
 oil very very aromatic and very rich and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.650
 we started to move it from one place to another 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 so that all the ingredients are 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 mix and the flavor is impregnated 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 inside this chicken 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.750
 once I saw him for a while 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.329
 we add the flour in which they are going to 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.810
 wrap these medium chicken prey 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.030
 approximately kilo and we close the bag 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.880
 turning it and making a kind of knot 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.939
 on the surface to start 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.130
 beat it and they are completely turned off 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.909
 in a simple way each of the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.909
 chicken strawberries 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.970
 you have to shake it well during a good 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 long so that they are completely 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.560
 cover so there is no 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.230
 empty space and then we open the bag and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.940
 we can start putting them on top of 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.010
 a tray that will go later 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.990
 the oven we add a grate so that 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.210
 the heat reaches him constantly and 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.490
 around the entire dam let's say and 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.890
 we started to locate one next to the 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.360
 another without leaving space and with the skin 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.030
 up because we want the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.830
 first part that is browned is the part of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.570
 the skin 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.820
 we locate all the chicken prey 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.800
 inside the tray that there is no 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.100
 empty space and no laziness left us 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.270
 and then place them correctly 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.270
 we take to the oven 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.610
 we have a preheated oven to 200 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.430
 degrees and let's say these chicken prey 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.440
 more or less to the middle of the oven so that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.730
 brown on the top and then 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
 we are going to turn them as we 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 advance the time we scratch a root of 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.590
 ginger in any container 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.620
 any radiator serves in this case if 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.989
 We use a plastic container and teeth 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.849
 of garlic also all together we're going to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.049
 mix or because it is cast at the same time 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.049
 inside the pot 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.420
 It's been a while since we got out of the oven 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.209
 the chicken legs and wings 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.370
 chicken actually and we turn them around with 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.890
 our clamp so that they go browning 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.480
 from the other side now the important thing 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.849
 is that so they do not circulate so much 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 we have to add a little bit of 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.519
 oil in this case a vegetable oil 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.079
 that does not dull the taste of the salitas and 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.370
 we missed the side of course still 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.370
 it has not been golden 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.500
 we light one of the strong fires and 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.020
 we put a pot so that it starts 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.470
 to heat a small teaspoon of 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.570
 oil and toss the ginger and garlic 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.140
 previously scratched a good amount 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.240
 of both a tablespoon full of 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.040
 Each of these ingredients 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.630
 we doray briefly can not grab 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.910
 any kind of colors just so that 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.940
 lose the strong flavor and add 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.500
 half a cup of blond sugar that can be 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.410
 perfectly replaced by sugar 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.700
 normal only that I like more this 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.070
 type of sugar can be found in 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.110
 any supermarket and also you 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.620
 we add half a cup equal amount 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.840
 that rice vinegar sugar with 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.239
 these two ingredients put 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.660
 we start spinning again and it's going to 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.220
 form a kind of honey or caramel 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.530
 we let his progress get out again 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.550
 the chicken legs and we're giving them 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.990
 return 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.790
 remember that they have to be golden 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.320
 equally everywhere while you 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.570
 add a couple of teaspoons 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.090
 soy sauce this only for 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.770
 generate a darker color and highlight 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.819
 a little bit of the flavors that we have 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.819
 clear inside the sauce 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.659
 we enter a spoonful of seeds 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.059
 Sesame inside our sauce and 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.899
 we stir until it generates a point 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:05.449
 almost candy we take out of the fire we put out 

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:08.119
 our burner and let's take out 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.119
 again the chicken wings from the oven 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:13.849
 in this case they are already 100% prepared 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:15.830
 we only have to generate the mixture 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.959
 we enter them well golden brown 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.780
 warm inside our sauce 

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:22.870
 bittersweet 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.300
 and after finishing that we started 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.300
 turn them to live still on deck 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.880
 good 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.120
 as simple as simple after 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.230
 everything is ready we clean the plate and 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.340
 our bittersweet chicken outings 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.320
 they are finished 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.440
 very well we have finished and here we have 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.949
 sweet and sour chicken wings with ginger 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.949
 and water
