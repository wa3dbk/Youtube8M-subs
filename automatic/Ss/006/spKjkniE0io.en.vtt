00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.790
 hi i'm mani smithy with let's go 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.320
 fish before going fishing 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.299
 I want to review some teams of 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.640
 very important security that you're going to 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.890
 need in your boat some of the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.650
 best fishing is done from a boat 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 this allows you to reach almost 100% 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.210
 from the place where you are fishing 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 especially when you're trying to 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.710
 capture the species that live in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.990
 deep water to start is always 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.270
 good idea to first check the rules of 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.579
 navigation security as well as the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.680
 local weather forecast before 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.170
 go on a trip to go out in the boat 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.960
 make sure first that someone on land 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.300
 know where you're going and how long are you going to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 be outside you must make sure that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.200
 you are in accordance with the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.640
 state and federal regulations 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.920
 fires and that the boat is 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 completely loaded with fuel like this 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.430
 that when you're in the water you should be 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.890
 prepared by any situation of 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.680
 emergency and make sure you have the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.689
 proper safety equipment first thing 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.479
 and more important is your device 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.219
 Personal flotation or life jackets 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.229
 state and federal law requires that 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.830
 have an effective device 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.350
 floatation 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.960
 personnel on board at least one per 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.000
 passenger there are other important elements 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.310
 that are needed to spend a day in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.230
 water you're going to need a basic one of 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.020
 first aid supplied with 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.330
 supplies like gauze bandage patches and 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.120
 Aspirin is also a good idea 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.310
 have something to throw like a cushion or 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
 a life-saving tire that you can throw 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.650
 to a person in the water devices 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.110
 signage such as sirens flares 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.060
 and whistles are necessary to have the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.520
 board in case of a situation of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.979
 emergency as well as an extinguisher 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 of fire fully charged radio 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.530
 marine high frequency and a telephone 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.900
 mobile 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.670
 finally you will need an anchor for the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.640
 boat to keep it from drifting 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.890
 with bad weather and crossed strings and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 of dock so you can give help to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.300
 someone or tie the boat to the dock 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.400
 maintain security as the maximum 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.890
 priority ensures you have a good day 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.930
 in the water for more information 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.840
