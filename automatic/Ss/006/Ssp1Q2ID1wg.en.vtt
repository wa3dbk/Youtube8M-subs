00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.820
 hello everyone with you again I specifically 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.629
 that shy dude who did 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.129
 review on the bike stels navigator 500 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.030
 today I want to show you my new 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.960
 bicycle 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 which was purchased March 21, 2014 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.440
 and it's called merida matts 40 drove 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.020
 I'm on this machine for more than a half 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.140
 thousand kilometers and impression from me 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.509
 left from him only put or so 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 well, where do we start let's begin with 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:25.090
 weights cutting here is average 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.090
 there is a front and rear switch 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 by the way on models of 2013 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 rear derailleur was olivia a 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.510
 front 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 tour well tell me honestly switches me 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.800
 quite satisfied with the correct 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 at the construction site 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 well and the right gear shift all 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.670
 will you work well korosten 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:06.899
 on this unit 27 that's what simplifies 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:10.130
 acceleration and all disc brakes 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 hydraulic by the way I forgot to say 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.110
 marking of this merida bike 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.840
 matts 40 d i.e. disk 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.830
 hydraulic brakes and they don't know 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.560
 what are my promax 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.400
 not specifically signed principle work 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.780
 they normally slow down well 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.510
 the only thing that strains it 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.600
 bonding drives do not know how to treat it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.320
 if anyone can know post to 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.590
 comments please so here still 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.069
 we have a fork from a fork a fork here 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.200
 suntour 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:55.439
 hot 100 millimeter in principle 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:03.629
 good diana's plug 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:04.500
 she has 2 pilot adjustments and more 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.350
 which one 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.530
 shorter first tune adjustment 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.450
 spring stiffness 2 can block 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.510
 move the plug so the coins 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 coins here 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.860
 also shimano altus in principle 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.580
 train speeds 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.400
 generally convenient 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:35.490
 buggy does not slow down 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:40.450
 so what's next we still have wheels 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.620
 wheels means 26 are the width of the tires 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.930
 26 to 210 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.200
 tires are very good I never know 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.450
 not pierced yet and ride myself along 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.980
 rough terrain in general 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.900
 tires I am very pleased 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:04.390
 as well, and let the two baths so I 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.810
 specifically you are not satisfied with what specifically 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.840
 I did not like it so they pedal 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:17.639
 honestly too small for my paw 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:22.349
 since i have 44 foot size is not comfortable 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:26.430
 they have to stand during acceleration 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:29.550
 saddle questions with many say it is not 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.909
 very uncomfortable sidushka presses rubs something 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.509
 there still i can say one dish this 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.639
 the seat is not walking so if you 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.120
 buy this great for quiet trips 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.180
 itâ€™s better to replace the city 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.370
 if you like a ride with the wind 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.889
 Well, so that there are a couple of cats Crush people from 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.909
 dogs clean up then this sidushka for 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:57.529
 you, in principle, is probably all that I am 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.210
 I wanted to tell you about this bike 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.990
