00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 show how to do a trick in two 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.740
 colors makes it a kind of small 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.240
 flop as you see where a lettering 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.859
 the most important thing is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 that we get to have some style or 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 whatever else come from your 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.530
 Besides, I insist that's why 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.199
 that I will not show you how to do 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 your letters actually I imagine that the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.510
 that you wanted to work even 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 that's what will make your 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.789
 styles and that it's really peculiar to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.210
 What are you doing now? 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 support 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 me in any case it is this one and I 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.779
 taken directly I make them directly 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
 above to have the proportions for 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 well framed and from there 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 I grew well but very much because 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 done that's what will stay black or 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 the dark color do like you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.040
 want but so here is from 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.989
 that moment where you grow up well 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.050
 withdrawal and you start by cutting 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.700
 just the white part ie 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.340
 just what actually corresponded to 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 part of man is under my bed what but 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 well inside the fact actually for in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.850
 to make a stencil simply 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 so here's one cut you have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.870
 your first stencils that says two 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 colors necessarily say stencils 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 mandatory provided that I have good 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.680
 dolls as the white part and for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.610
 now it's going to be the colorful part 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.140
 so it's a little leaf them in 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.549
 quarter against way you do not care 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.680
 do not need it to be very very 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.689
 solid it will necessarily hold so its 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.909
 gondolas and it does not matter how it is 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.210
 a layer of tests up the expression just 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.990
 to have the demarcations and we 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.420
 retains 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.950
 I made a dark color but it's 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.960
 not quite serious so here's the one 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.430
 there it will be necessary to cut it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.740
 your final stencil then I 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.149
 take this one here and there now I 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.380
 I'll cut everything on the roof I'll do 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.119
 a little outline all around keep 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.259
 a few drops or I do not know I'm going 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 maybe to remove them is not very 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.369
 pretty 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 and here you see I actually go 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.130
 cut all around but just the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.600
 counter here I come and then you 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.190
 have your second stencil that 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.020
 necessarily not much 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.229
 normal it's just the outline of the one 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.729
 there what finally yes here is what will 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.769
 allow to make a little con round 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.000
 Why 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.010
 that's good I can keep the drops and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.390
 I find them really awful too 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.220
 small formats I had too much to take 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.760
 place on the flop in not very 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.650
 interesting that's the same pattern 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 on that one you and I have well 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.660
 kept this part one and the other side 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.090
 I will keep the nails actually for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.750
 that it allows to reframe me of course 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.750
 the stencil after 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.880
 There you go 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.880
 this little task that will be black and 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.610
 coup is reworking cutting is this 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.590
 that we have to cut the two and therefore 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.590
 here you have or your two stencil 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.660
 this one is this one I already asked 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 because one hand is enough 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.560
 picky but you see that it's 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.240
 just the stickers I took at the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.709
 base and I just laid the other one by 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:18.160
 on it all stupidly then here it is 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.160
 just put it differently 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.050
 and then you just have to ask 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.710
 your turkey and stencils and their bread 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.710
 quite simply 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.099
 good the ends of paint bombs it's 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.099
 not terrible at the horizontal especially that 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.750
 I like to take advantage of 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.360
 stickers for really emptied what 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.519
 rest 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.870
 so I take advantage of it 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:04:02.000
 does not prevent you from doing a gradient or 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.470
 anything else whatever where everything is 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.109
 allowed 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.109
 have fun with small patterns or what 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:19.479
 that's what 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.479
 me 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.689
 the kohl era and not on each other 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.919
 waiting well drying because 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.889
 otherwise they will stick to each other 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.710
 horrible how do I say soul is a 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.259
 little a temporary tutorial there is the old if 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.819
 you want me to propose you 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.520
 I'm here it's even more propaganda 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.900
 even more vandal but at least that 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.360
 allows in a city like ours by 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.490
 example of to move and be able to 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.819
 to write everywhere without risking too much 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.139
 great thing so here's the next this 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.639
 will really be lettering a little bit 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.909
 more complex it was really a step 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.740
 to go a little forward but but it's okay 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.849
 to go more it will be complex what me the 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.849
 have a good day
