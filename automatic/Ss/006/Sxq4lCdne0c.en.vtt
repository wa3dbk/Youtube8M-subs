00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 great matching names found because 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.800
 somehow everything already exists and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 creative but I have 60,000 totally

 I'll be infinitely grateful for that 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.090
 the following video is only for 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 entertainment any representation of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.850
 comments is completely arbitrary and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.829
 fictitious 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.960
 All comments are in real life 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.989
 have been written and can have traces of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 contain nuts 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 Something has to be looked after tower 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.579
 to be something in this video 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.610
 really an owner childish secretly 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.109

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.550
 back 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.060

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119

 then certainly not you maybe 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 The comment was not meant seriously 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.460
 then you do not really wonder 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.990
 Now I have my secret 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 i am a silly mandy and i am 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.830
 very proud of it and I think silly 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.320
 is a very nice compliment so 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.640
 thank you for being silly is really in 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 theirs says you all knew that it was 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.690
 as if someone would say you are 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.770
 the most beautiful woman in the world like that 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.770
 does it feel for me 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.030
 how you do it that you speak so well 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.030
 without moving the moon 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.440
 Did you know that I am not 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.750
 belly speech I can tell you now 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440
 I can speak without my mouth to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.180
 move 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.780
 It's not always easy, though 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.610
 i can be stressful wedding 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.269
 bell- mouthed hectares do less familiar 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.900
 you are his jutta or something 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:42.370
 I know myself with star wars star trek 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 star wars i think 00 neger little out 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.030
 but I think that's the way it is 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 speaks as if no grammar 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.799
 stock active warehouse as much as I want 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.069
 ok nexway open julia bill stewart 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.069
 inacio there 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.629
 So I do not find the food in 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.299
 order 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.940
 that was really nice how many are 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.049
 because of my big one 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.909
 food waste excited 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.920
 have some of the products already 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.599
 had expired and I would not have anyway 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.319
 can use and especially from 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.829
 things and quantities that were so minimal 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.079
 that one of them nor any third 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.170
 Of course , feeding the world can be yes 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.370
 a role model but you 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.079
 I must also see that I am such a 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.000
 A little balance must be made between entertainment value 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.250
 I would like to do something like this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.319
 what just disgusting and also 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.040
 food waste but you 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.620
 we have to think 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.959
 There were maybe 15 rice grains yes 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.030
 some countries are 15 30 kÃ¶ln whole 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.769
 a lot but when I now reis 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.220
 that would have eaten the children in 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.769
 Africa 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 Unfortunately I did not bring anything 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.129
 understand that that just so the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.079
 But gesture is always the same 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.670
 a little relation thing if only 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.790
 For example, British youtubers do that 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.250
 this is celebrated until now 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.139
 and rottweil and a little bit 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.359
 Mentality thing about it once wanted 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.180
 make video what you like the youtube 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.200
 mentality especially in Germany 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.880
 and in other countries 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.889
 I would like to compare this to everyone 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.290
 If so, speak again 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:16.039
 still 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.549
 that is something like me in the race 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.859
 dear day 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.539
 i do not run stupid i run nice 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.370
 So I think it's a bit 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.360
 cheeky is also a channel locked and 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.030

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.470

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.039

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.039

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:49.249
 I wanted so much because usain bolt 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.090
 lead and ask me my running style 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:05:00.439
 I do not think that's nice now 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:03.439
 but with this kimberly blue i find 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:05.300
 You think this village but this full of fun 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.919
 should the puk in malibu say that you 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.270

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.300

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.529

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.449

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:32.180

 Video that was an idea for a good one 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:58.199
 you could get a cool ten types of parents 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:02.100
 maybe ten kinds of students c 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:04.770

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.060
