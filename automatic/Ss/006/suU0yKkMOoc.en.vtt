00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 O 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.290
 is getting honey on the wheel 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.480
 my new steering wheel today in my 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 today and we'll talk about it. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.529
 We do not even know, but there's something. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.529
 cool, I think it's wise to talk 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.140
 is the following is some people write 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 for me speaking exactly like this 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.660
 Honey, what I want to do already has a lot 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 People used to do, for example, I want to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.770
 become coaching 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.680
 I look at my team there in 95 6 team and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.090
 coach is to discuss from here or from that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 How do I go to study? 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 coaching since everyone now 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.290
 coaching lot of people the right coach 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.390
 logical but what you have to understand is 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.330
 that you are unique 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.330
 You're the only special person and you. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.790
 has a purpose in this world and this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.580
 purpose if you feel a calling that is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.530
 through coaching or through the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.590
 love and you want to dance you record 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.470
 videos and want to entertain people is that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 everybody comes with the mission that's what 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.720
 I believe 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 You will not fail to comply with your 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.580
 mission because no one can not even b 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 Doing what you already do and you will. 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 express your mission in a unique way 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.789
 in a special way and that no one is going 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.159
 express you have to think that no 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.680
 product will be the same as the other 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.840
 no body will be the same as the other if 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 you put yourself in what you do in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.540
 when you stop sharing with the world 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 What did you come to share? 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.340
 You're not coming just from you. 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.070
 taking a lot of people who are going to 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 inspiring with you will learn from you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.869
 that you benefited what you are going 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.869
 do 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.710
 I think we sometimes people 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 is too worried that the other 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.580
 is doing it and it is a thing that is very 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.080
 dangerous 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.270
 we have to think about what people 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 came to make our customers think 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.330
 in the people that we can inspire 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.040
 I can be doing what everyone else 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.840
 is doing but there are some people who 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.220
 do not identify yourself exactly with me 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.500
 some people who will like 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.480
 exactly in my way of speaking in my 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.250
 simple way my stripped-down way 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.959
 way to record life in the car 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.120
 suddenly other road is here today is the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.950
 that I 'm talking and let's breathe with 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.420
 another person who already speaks in a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.989
 more serious that she already speaks in a 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.239
 different otherwise but I do not even know myself 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.850
 I know that I have come to fulfill my mission. 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.160
 to share with other people 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.920
 The things I learn from mine 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.950
 life story is my knowledge 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.390
 about entrepreneurship so I do 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.459
 The question of dividing then has 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.410
 person who is benefiting from this 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.660
 knowledge is my role is to help this 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.970
 a person you have the courage to share 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 with one of their gifts their talents the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.660
 your knowledge 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.640
 you not only teach other people 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.680
 you inspire people to do 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.510
 same thing and has another subject that 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 is also linked to this subject that is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.930
 important to talk about is what is the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.760
 following is often you will find 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.760
 What do you have to say that what? 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 You have to teach is not important. 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 enough and everyone knows what you 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.200
 is talking and you do not know the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.769
 enough to teach someone I can 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.110
 make sure you always know 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.579
 thing more than anyone this is obvious 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.320
 everyone has something to learn all 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.180
 world has something to teach, do not let the 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.130
 inner troubadour tell you that your 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.769
 content is not good enough that you 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.600
 need to do a series of courses and not 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.750
 I know how many to teach 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.269
 something and you after you 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.840
 make a road after you make 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.090
 doctorates and will start teaching 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.739
 that matters here you are promoting the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.290
 transformation in someone in some way 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.390
 you can teach 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.859
 I'm sure you have a lot to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.689
 teach, then do not take the world out of 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.120
 good things you came to share 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.209
