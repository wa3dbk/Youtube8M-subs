they are used for something else too so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.349 
they are used for something else too so
I'm<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.650> into<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.359> first

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
I'm going to get right into this first

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.550 
I'm going to get right into this first
off<00:00:18.630> we're<00:00:18.869> going<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> start<00:00:19.260> off<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
off we're going to start off with the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
off we're going to start off with the
machete<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.119> machete<00:00:21.420> does<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
machete actually and the machete does a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.609 
machete actually and the machete does a
damaged<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.640> 4.5<00:00:23.640> hearts<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.510> good<00:00:25.439> for

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
damaged of 4.5 hearts and it is good for

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
damaged of 4.5 hearts and it is good for
250<00:00:26.310> uses<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.880> let's<00:00:27.539> say<00:00:27.720> that's<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.260> hit<00:00:28.470> on

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
250 uses so let's say that's one hit on

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.849 
250 uses so let's say that's one hit on
a<00:00:29.300> sheep<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.570> I'll<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
a sheep and I'll see what we got on a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.990 
a sheep and I'll see what we got on a
pig<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.640> pig<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.380> one<00:00:34.380> hit<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:35.000> so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
pig and a pig should be one hit two so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540 
pig and a pig should be one hit two so
yeah<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.399> hit

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:55.320> useful<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this is actually pretty useful it's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.069 
this is actually pretty useful it's
really<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.879> hard<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.239> craft<00:00:57.480> actually

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
really not that hard to craft actually

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
really not that hard to craft actually
which<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.590> definitely<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> good<00:00:59.579> part<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
which is definitely a good part of this

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pretty in depth on how to craft them so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.810 
pretty in depth on how to craft them so
i'm<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> bother<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.820> next

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
uses for this is 1500 and I'll show you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.069 
uses for this is 1500 and I'll show you
guys<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.600> damage<00:01:30.990> against<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:32.570> zombie<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.840> hit

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
guys the damage against a zombie one hit

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
guys the damage against a zombie one hit
it<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:35.100> hit<00:01:35.280> kill<00:01:35.310> against<00:01:35.729> everything

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it is a one hit kill against everything

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
it is a one hit kill against everything
but<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> Enderdragon<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.770> iron<00:01:38.579> golems

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but the Enderdragon and in iron golems

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
but the Enderdragon and in iron golems
so<00:01:39.530> that's<00:01:40.530> something<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> keep<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.070> mind<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so that's something to keep in mind it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
so that's something to keep in mind it
is<00:01:41.549> definitely<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.540> overpowered<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.040> very

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
is definitely not overpowered it is very

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
is definitely not overpowered it is very
hard<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.549> craft<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:45.960> really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
hard to craft and it's actually really

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
hard to craft and it's actually really
useful<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.700> my<00:01:47.820> favorite

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
useful so this is one of my favorite

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
useful so this is one of my favorite
tools<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> next<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.560> move<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
tools in this and next we can move on to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530 
tools in this and next we can move on to
the<00:01:50.040> baseball<00:01:50.399> bat<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.850> cannot<00:01:51.149> cut<00:01:51.390> down

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
killing stuff with baseball bats see

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
killing stuff with baseball bats see
it's<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.450> hit<00:01:57.600> kill<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.960> pigs<00:01:58.259> all<00:01:58.500> these

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's a one hit kill on pigs all these

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's a one hit kill on pigs all these
are<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.009> one<00:01:59.189> hit<00:01:59.340> kills<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.790> pigs

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
are going to be one hit kills on pigs

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.420 
are going to be one hit kills on pigs
for<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> most<00:02:00.479> part<00:02:00.710> with<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.770> exception<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for the most part with one exception I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
for the most part with one exception I
believe<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.360> let's<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> zombie

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
believe but let's go on to the zombie

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.300 
believe but let's go on to the zombie
does<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.869> 4.5<00:02:06.869> hearts<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> damage<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.160> is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
does a 4.5 hearts of damage and it is

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.639 
does a 4.5 hearts of damage and it is
good<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:08.970> 59<00:02:09.390> uses<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
good for 59 uses so this is a really

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.490 
good for 59 uses so this is a really
easy<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.280> craft<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:12.000> lot<00:02:12.540> easier<00:02:12.750> than<00:02:12.930> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
easy one to craft a lot easier than the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.640 
easy one to craft a lot easier than the
Shetty<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:15.120> obviously<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.020> has<00:02:16.110> less<00:02:16.320> uses

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
Shetty but obviously it has less uses

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.140 
Shetty but obviously it has less uses
and<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.250> upgraded<00:02:17.790> vet<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
and now we have the upgraded vet and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.330 
and now we have the upgraded vet and
it's<00:02:18.300> basically<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.780> bat<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.350> nails<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
it's basically a bat with nails in it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's basically a bat with nails in it
and<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.180> pretty<00:02:21.510> badass<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.350> let<00:02:22.830> me

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
and this is pretty badass and let me

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.830 
and this is pretty badass and let me
kill<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.100> guy<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> guys<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
kill this guy so you guys can see it's a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.650 
kill this guy so you guys can see it's a
one<00:02:25.080> hit<00:02:25.260> kill<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> chainsaw<00:02:26.660> but

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
one hit kill just like the chainsaw but

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.070 
one hit kill just like the chainsaw but
unfortunately<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:29.820> only<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.300> good<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.660> 59

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
unfortunately it only is good for 59

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.050 
unfortunately it only is good for 59
uses<00:02:31.350> as<00:02:31.530> well<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.340> easier<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.700> craft

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
uses as well as it is easier to craft

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
uses as well as it is easier to craft
and<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.360> also<00:02:33.900> can't<00:02:34.260> cut<00:02:34.410> down<00:02:34.590> trees<00:02:34.830> as

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and you also can't cut down trees as

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.340 
and you also can't cut down trees as
easily<00:02:35.430> with<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> as<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.330> took<00:02:37.200> quite

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
easily with it as you can see took quite

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.830 
easily with it as you can see took quite
a<00:02:37.410> while<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.590> cut<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.040> tree<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.630> yeah

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
a while to cut down that tree so yeah

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.170 
a while to cut down that tree so yeah
that<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.770> part<00:02:41.310> now<00:02:41.910> we're<00:02:42.030> going<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that is this part now we're going to

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.810 
that is this part now we're going to
move<00:02:42.240> on<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.140> fire<00:02:43.500> X<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.400> fire<00:02:44.580> X

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
move on to the fire X and the fire X

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.979 
move on to the fire X and the fire X
actually<00:02:45.150> has<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.270> couple<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.660> interesting

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
actually has a couple of interesting

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.460 
actually has a couple of interesting
uses<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> fire<00:02:47.670> axe<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.209> good<00:02:48.780> for<00:02:48.959> 400

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
uses so the fire axe is good for 400

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.750 
uses so the fire axe is good for 400
uses<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:52.140> does<00:02:52.590> 4.5<00:02:53.370> hearts<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760

little less than the other ones but

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.979 
little less than the other ones but
that's<00:03:04.709> perfectly<00:03:05.220> fine<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.640> me<00:03:05.820> it's<00:03:06.780> nots

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
that's perfectly fine with me it's nots

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's perfectly fine with me it's nots
main<00:03:07.230> use<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.370> let's<00:03:08.610> go<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.209> kill

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
main use actually so let's go and kill

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.080 
main use actually so let's go and kill
this<00:03:09.540> zombie<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:10.260> two<00:03:10.760> three<00:03:11.760> hits<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.060> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
this zombie one two three hits on a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.360 
this zombie one two three hits on a
zombie<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.989> main<00:03:13.230> use<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.920> actually

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
zombie the main use of this is actually

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.300 
zombie the main use of this is actually
as<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> regular<00:03:15.000> X<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.900> actually<00:03:16.739> goes<00:03:16.920> pretty

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
as a regular X it actually goes pretty

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.880 
as a regular X it actually goes pretty
well<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.239> strong<00:03:18.600> as<00:03:18.660> an<00:03:19.080> iron<00:03:19.320> axe<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
well it is as strong as an iron axe I

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.410 
well it is as strong as an iron axe I
believe<00:03:20.190> however<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.239> is<00:03:21.780> also<00:03:21.870> used<00:03:22.260> for

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
believe however it is also used for

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.640 
believe however it is also used for
breaking<00:03:24.420> glass<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> really<00:03:25.440> weird

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
breaking glass which is a really weird

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
breaking glass which is a really weird
one<00:03:25.830> because<00:03:26.070> it's<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.400> fire<00:03:26.580> axe<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.269> used

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
one because it's a fire axe it is used

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.120 
one because it's a fire axe it is used
to<00:03:27.630> break<00:03:27.840> down<00:03:28.019> homes<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.530> glass<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.739> stuff

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
to break down homes and glass and stuff

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.789 
to break down homes and glass and stuff
so<00:03:29.459> that's<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.030> main<00:03:30.180> use<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.799> here's

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
so that's the main use of it so here's

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.890 
so that's the main use of it so here's
how<00:03:31.980> fast<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.430> normally<00:03:32.790> goes<00:03:32.820> glass<00:03:33.630> goes

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
how fast it normally goes glass goes

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900 
how fast it normally goes glass goes
pretty<00:03:34.140> easily<00:03:34.380> but<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> fire<00:03:35.370> axe<00:03:35.640> it's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
pretty easily but with the fire axe it's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.170 
pretty easily but with the fire axe it's
almost<00:03:36.120> instantaneous<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.140> mean<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:38.060> can<00:03:39.060> almost

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
almost instantaneous I mean I can almost

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270 
almost instantaneous I mean I can almost
use<00:03:39.330> my<00:03:39.540> rapid<00:03:39.870> fire<00:03:40.049> macro<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:40.739> mouse<00:03:40.950> it's

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
use my rapid fire macro on my mouse it's

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.280 
use my rapid fire macro on my mouse it's
so<00:03:41.489> instantaneous<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:42.930> actually<00:03:43.079> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
so instantaneous so that's actually a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.590 
so instantaneous so that's actually a
strange<00:03:43.950> use<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.579> not<00:03:45.180> really<00:03:45.329> sure<00:03:45.480> why

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
strange use for it not really sure why

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.000 
strange use for it not really sure why
the<00:03:45.660> mod<00:03:45.900> maker<00:03:46.110> put<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.620> there<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:46.920> it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the mod maker put that in there but it's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.640 
the mod maker put that in there but it's
pretty<00:03:47.190> cool<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.090> forgot<00:03:48.510> one<00:03:49.019> thing<00:03:49.049> i

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
pretty cool and I forgot one thing i

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.069 
pretty cool and I forgot one thing i
forgot<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.400> combat<00:03:51.090> knife<00:03:51.269> for<00:03:51.630> some<00:03:51.780> reason

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
forgot the combat knife for some reason

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.020 
forgot the combat knife for some reason
and<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.920> combat<00:03:53.280> knife<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.579> actually<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.000> of

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
and the combat knife is actually one of

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.479 
and the combat knife is actually one of
the<00:03:54.090> worst<00:03:54.329> weapons<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.560> does<00:03:55.950> 2.5

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
the worst weapons in this it does 2.5

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.560 
the worst weapons in this it does 2.5
hearts<00:03:56.760> of<00:03:56.850> damage<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:58.130> 200<00:03:59.299> uses<00:04:00.299> and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
hearts of damage and it is 200 uses and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.840 
hearts of damage and it is 200 uses and
it<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.410> actually<00:04:01.590> better<00:04:01.950> than<00:04:02.040> an<00:04:02.250> iron<00:04:02.489> sword

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
it is actually better than an iron sword

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.420 
it is actually better than an iron sword
but<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.840> pretty<00:04:04.230> difficult<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.860> craft<00:04:05.130> i

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
but it's pretty difficult to craft i

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.250 
but it's pretty difficult to craft i
think<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.480> little<00:04:06.600> more<00:04:06.810> difficult<00:04:07.019> to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
think it's a little more difficult to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.699 
think it's a little more difficult to
craft<00:04:07.590> than<00:04:07.769> an<00:04:07.890> iron<00:04:08.130> sword<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:10.530> is

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
craft than an iron sword but it is

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.390 
craft than an iron sword but it is
definitely<00:04:11.690> not<00:04:12.690> overpowered<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:13.590> i'll<00:04:14.130> show

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
definitely not overpowered so i'll show

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.610 
definitely not overpowered so i'll show
you<00:04:14.489> guys<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:15.030> two<00:04:16.130> three<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:19.049> three

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you guys one two three so it is a three

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.349 
you guys one two three so it is a three
hit<00:04:19.739> kill<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.070> zombies<00:04:20.519> obviously<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.299> not

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
hit kill on zombies obviously it's not

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.129 
hit kill on zombies obviously it's not
one<00:04:21.660> hit<00:04:21.870> kill<00:04:22.080> on<00:04:22.320> anything

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
one hit kill on anything

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.339 
one hit kill on anything
so<00:04:24.860> that's<00:04:25.129> definitely<00:04:25.430> cool<00:04:25.759> stats<00:04:26.599> are<00:04:26.749> 2.5

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
so that's definitely cool stats are 2.5

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.709 
so that's definitely cool stats are 2.5
parts<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.710> damage<00:04:28.009> and<00:04:28.129> it<00:04:28.460> will<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:29.479> good<00:04:29.659> for

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:29.719 
parts of damage and it will be good for

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.499 
parts of damage and it will be good for
200<00:04:30.409> uses<00:04:31.159> which<00:04:31.310> i<00:04:31.400> think<00:04:31.460> i<00:04:31.639> said<00:04:31.819> before<00:04:31.939> so

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
200 uses which i think i said before so

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:33.519 
200 uses which i think i said before so
