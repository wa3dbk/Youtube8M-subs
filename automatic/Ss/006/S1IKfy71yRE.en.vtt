the review will be up next week
yesterday<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> felt<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:22.410> know<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.890> little<00:00:23.220> bit

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:23.339 
yesterday I felt you know a little bit

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.919 
yesterday I felt you know a little bit
of<00:00:23.460> relief<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.789> find<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.179> radical<00:00:24.839> it

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
of relief to find the radical it

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.839 
of relief to find the radical it
appeared<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.259> be<00:00:25.380> better<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:26.310> perfect<00:00:26.519> but

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
appeared to be better not perfect but

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.279 
appeared to be better not perfect but
certainly<00:00:27.240> better<00:00:27.509> something<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> could

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
certainly better something I could

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.870 
certainly better something I could
actually<00:00:28.410> drive<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.279> could<00:00:29.400> actually<00:00:29.550> hit<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
actually drive we could actually hit a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.330 
actually drive we could actually hit a
few<00:00:30.150> apex<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.749> rather<00:00:31.080> than<00:00:31.349> sort<00:00:31.829> of<00:00:31.949> swivel

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
few apex is rather than sort of swivel

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270 
few apex is rather than sort of swivel
around<00:00:32.550> them<00:00:33.440> again<00:00:34.440> though<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.830> still<00:00:35.010> had

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
around them again though it still had

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
around them again though it still had
that<00:00:35.490> that<00:00:36.150> feeling<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.720> speed<00:00:37.080> where<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.470> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that that feeling at speed where it's a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
that that feeling at speed where it's a
little<00:00:37.560> bit<00:00:37.890> unstable<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.090> didn't<00:00:39.330> seem

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
little bit unstable but it didn't seem

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
little bit unstable but it didn't seem
too<00:00:40.020> bad<00:00:40.380> well<00:00:40.650> let's<00:00:40.800> try<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.220> high<00:00:41.400> speed

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
too bad well let's try it on high speed

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
too bad well let's try it on high speed
circuit<00:00:42.240> then<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.510> tried<00:00:42.720> it<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:42.870> Monza<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.770> was

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
circuit then I tried it on Monza it was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
circuit then I tried it on Monza it was
a<00:00:43.950> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.490> over<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> place<00:00:44.850> videos

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
a little bit all over the place videos

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
a little bit all over the place videos
to<00:00:45.690> follow<00:00:45.900> on<00:00:46.080> that<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.620> first<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to follow on that but first let's just

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.120 
to follow on that but first let's just
take<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> look<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.090> spa<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.780> give<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.830> so<00:00:50.010> we

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
take a look at spa I give you so we

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.620 
take a look at spa I give you so we
found<00:00:50.340> yesterday<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:50.940> radical<00:00:51.330> pit<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
found yesterday that the radical pit to

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.450 
found yesterday that the radical pit to
work<00:00:51.810> on<00:00:52.050> brands<00:00:52.470> better<00:00:52.680> let's<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
work on brands better let's see how it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.760 
work on brands better let's see how it
works<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:54.290> Belgium<00:00:57.020> highly<00:00:58.020> quick<00:00:58.200> goals<00:00:58.410> on

for these guys to settle down a little
bit<00:01:50.250> there's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.730> movement<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
bit there's a lot of movement in the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:06.420 
bit there's a lot of movement in the
field

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430 

because<00:02:07.030> moving<00:02:07.330> about<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.690> lot<00:02:07.930> there<00:02:08.110> isn't

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
because moving about a lot there isn't

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.139 
because moving about a lot there isn't
it<00:02:08.500> i<00:02:08.530> can't<00:02:08.890> keep<00:02:09.039> it<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.399> racing<00:02:09.759> line<00:02:09.789> at

I<00:02:43.010> will<00:02:43.849> try<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.120> garbage<00:02:44.480> weaken<00:02:44.840> our<00:02:44.959> catch

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
I will try and garbage weaken our catch

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.800 
I will try and garbage weaken our catch
up<00:02:45.440> with<00:02:45.560> these<00:02:45.680> guys<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:46.390> really<00:02:47.390> get<00:02:47.629> into

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
up with these guys and really get into

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.000 
up with these guys and really get into
the<00:02:47.900> mix<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.349> think<00:02:48.560> we're<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.860> need<00:02:48.920> to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the mix I think we're going to need to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.680 
the mix I think we're going to need to
be<00:02:49.190> aggressive<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.849> get<00:02:49.970> past<00:02:50.209> them<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.569> the

where<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.530> want<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:41.800> be<00:03:46.650> whole<00:03:47.790> taken<00:03:48.790> out<00:03:50.760> okay

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
where I want to be whole taken out okay

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.710 
where I want to be whole taken out okay
so<00:03:51.820> another<00:03:52.390> attempt<00:03:52.960> then<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:56.160> spa<00:03:57.720> click

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
so another attempt then it spa click

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.920 
so another attempt then it spa click
that<00:03:58.870> buddy<00:03:59.080> AI<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.650> few<00:03:59.980> times<00:04:00.250> now<00:04:00.930> doesn't

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
that buddy AI a few times now doesn't

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.360 
that buddy AI a few times now doesn't
help<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.350> am<00:04:02.560> struggling<00:04:02.920> with<00:04:03.130> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
help that I am struggling with the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.800 
help that I am struggling with the
radical<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:03.940> this<00:04:04.030> track<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.420> seemed<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.630> be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
radical and this track and seemed to be

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.990 
radical and this track and seemed to be
the<00:04:04.900> faster<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.470> goes<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.710> more<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.820> just

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
the faster it goes the more it just

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.490 
the faster it goes the more it just
becomes<00:04:07.300> totally<00:04:07.600> unstable<00:04:08.260> and

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.670 

come<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.750> taking<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.840> again

00:04:33.419 --> 00:05:20.140 
to the cars over speed bear oh my god
like<00:04:34.419> so<00:04:34.870> unstable

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.350

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
because I can't keep this our study just

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.870

sessions<00:05:41.960> on<00:05:42.380> spa<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.950> could<00:05:43.520> drive<00:05:43.670> it<00:05:43.850> on<00:05:44.000> the

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
sessions on spa I could drive it on the

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.030 
sessions on spa I could drive it on the
racing<00:05:44.510> line<00:05:44.540> if<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.230> tiptoed<00:05:45.650> around<00:05:45.830> the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
racing line if I tiptoed around the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.650 
racing line if I tiptoed around the
circuit<00:05:46.550> but<00:05:46.760> I<00:05:46.790> couldn't<00:05:47.120> really<00:05:47.180> drive<00:05:47.630> it

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
circuit but I couldn't really drive it

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.630 
circuit but I couldn't really drive it
as<00:05:47.930> I<00:05:48.020> wanted<00:05:48.350> to<00:05:48.470> drive<00:05:48.680> it<00:05:48.890> it's<00:05:49.400> strange

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
as I wanted to drive it it's strange

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.370 
as I wanted to drive it it's strange
it's<00:05:50.090> like<00:05:50.240> on<00:05:50.390> the<00:05:50.480> one<00:05:50.630> hand<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:51.080> wants<00:05:51.290> you

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
it's like on the one hand it wants you

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.840 
it's like on the one hand it wants you
to<00:05:51.530> just<00:05:51.740> sit<00:05:51.950> in<00:05:52.100> the<00:05:52.160> middle<00:05:52.280> of<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.490> straight

seemingly can't get past the AI they're
just<00:06:08.840> fighting<00:06:09.260> each<00:06:09.620> other<00:06:09.800> bashing<00:06:10.370> into

each<00:06:10.640> other<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.330> every<00:06:11.960> time<00:06:12.200> I<00:06:12.230> try<00:06:12.530> to

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
each other and every time I try to

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560 
each other and every time I try to
overtake<00:06:13.040> her<00:06:13.220> got<00:06:13.370> taken<00:06:13.610> out<00:06:13.910> as<00:06:14.120> well<00:06:14.330> but

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
overtake her got taken out as well but

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.480 
overtake her got taken out as well but
certainly<00:06:15.290> a<00:06:15.410> lot<00:06:15.740> more<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.100> learning<00:06:16.400> the

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
certainly a lot more to learning the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.280 
certainly a lot more to learning the
game<00:06:16.640> I'll<00:06:17.060> be<00:06:17.180> testing<00:06:17.390> that<00:06:17.720> car<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.140> more

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
game I'll be testing that car and more

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.380 
game I'll be testing that car and more
circuits<00:06:18.800> as<00:06:18.920> well<00:06:19.100> as<00:06:19.220> testing<00:06:19.640> other<00:06:20.060> cars
