probably not even put cinnamon sugar on
the<00:03:02.359> first<00:03:02.629> side<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.290> when<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> flip<00:03:03.799> it<00:03:03.889> just

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
the first side and when you flip it just

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.520 
the first side and when you flip it just
do<00:03:04.219> it<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.549> top<00:03:04.790> side<00:03:05.139> but<00:03:06.139> that<00:03:06.319> should

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
do it on that top side but that should

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.959 
do it on that top side but that should
be<00:03:06.680> about<00:03:06.859> done<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.400> want<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:07.669> to<00:03:07.790> look

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969
