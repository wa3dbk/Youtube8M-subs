00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670 

I<00:00:05.629> got<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.660> phone<00:00:06.870> call<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.259> they<00:00:07.319> asked<00:00:07.560> me

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
I got a phone call and they asked me

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.560 
I got a phone call and they asked me
what<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.830> consider<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.700> New<00:00:09.000> York<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.510> my

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
what I consider going to New York for my

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.900 
what I consider going to New York for my
second<00:00:09.929> year<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.110> program<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.130> think<00:00:11.610> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
second year in the program and I think I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.100 
second year in the program and I think I
thought<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.809> 30

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
thought about it for all of about 30

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.080 
thought about it for all of about 30
seconds<00:00:13.590> before<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.980> said<00:00:14.400> yes

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.670 

so<00:00:18.599> I<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.810> at<00:00:19.019> that<00:00:19.050> time<00:00:19.170> there<00:00:19.560> was

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
so I think at that time there was

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.800 
so I think at that time there was
probably<00:00:19.980> age<00:00:20.250> ambassadors<00:00:21.060> going<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.539> US

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
probably age ambassadors going to the US

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.420 
probably age ambassadors going to the US
we<00:00:22.259> were<00:00:22.380> all<00:00:22.560> together<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:23.009> think<00:00:23.279> probably

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we were all together I think probably

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
we were all together I think probably
for<00:00:23.669> about<00:00:23.910> five<00:00:24.119> days<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.480> New<00:00:24.599> York<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> then

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
for about five days in New York and then

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.409
