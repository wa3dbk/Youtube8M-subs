hello<00:00:00.960> everybody<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:02.220> name<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.820> Matt<00:00:03.060> Hawley

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hello everybody my name is Matt Hawley

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello everybody my name is Matt Hawley
and<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.959> our<00:00:04.110> first<00:00:04.410> test<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:04.980> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
and this is our first test for the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.760 
and this is our first test for the
herbal<00:00:06.029> controller<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:07.379> not<00:00:07.500> really<00:00:07.620> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
herbal controller I'm not really the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.580 
herbal controller I'm not really the
first<00:00:07.950> that's<00:00:08.189> not<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> v<00:00:08.730> tests<00:00:09.590> we're

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
first that's not like the v tests we're

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.410 
first that's not like the v tests we're
looking<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> hardware<00:00:11.460> here

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
looking at the hardware here

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.710 
looking at the hardware here
I<00:00:12.450> bought<00:00:13.049> some<00:00:13.380> long<00:00:14.330> what<00:00:15.330> are<00:00:15.389> these<00:00:15.570> things

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
I bought some long what are these things

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.179 
I bought some long what are these things
something<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:18.930> Long's<00:00:19.230> motors

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
something from Long's motors

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
something from Long's motors
I<00:00:20.220> think<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:20.970> 1400<00:00:21.630> ounce<00:00:21.779> inch<00:00:22.109> motors

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
I think it's 1400 ounce inch motors

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
I think it's 1400 ounce inch motors
these<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.609> JB's<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.660> driver

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
these do JB's here this is the driver

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
these do JB's here this is the driver
for<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.430> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.730> power<00:00:26.910> supply<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:28.550> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
for it this is the power supply and that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
for it this is the power supply and that
is<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.210> herbal<00:00:30.869> controller<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
is the herbal controller with the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
is the herbal controller with the
Arduino<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:33.420> power<00:00:33.660> supply<00:00:34.050> stole<00:00:34.410> out

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
Arduino and some power supply stole out

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.950 
Arduino and some power supply stole out
of<00:00:34.590> something<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.520> little<00:00:36.450> bit<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> power

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
of something so a little bit of a power

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
of something so a little bit of a power
jack<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:38.239> regular<00:00:39.239> monitor<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.790> we're

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
jack there regular monitor and we're

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
jack there regular monitor and we're
gonna<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.450> thing<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:43.020> doesn't

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
gonna see how this thing does doesn't

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.459 
gonna see how this thing does doesn't
really<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.250> access<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> play<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.469> so

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
really have one access to play with so

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.840 
really have one access to play with so
on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:48.090> side<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:49.050> oh<00:00:49.399> there<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
on the back side here oh there it is it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
on the back side here oh there it is it
will<00:00:52.010> switch<00:00:53.090> doohickey<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:55.199> thing<00:00:55.469> turns

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
will switch doohickey that thing turns

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.279 
will switch doohickey that thing turns
on<00:00:57.440> herbal<00:00:58.440> starts<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.100> wake<00:00:59.579> up<00:01:00.109> should<00:01:01.109> wake

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
on herbal starts to wake up should wake

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.570 
on herbal starts to wake up should wake
up<00:01:01.760> that's<00:01:02.760> blank<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:04.309> every<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:05.400> that's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
up that's blank in every go that's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
up that's blank in every go that's
coming<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.850> okay<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.270> excellent<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
coming up okay good excellent so so the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.350 
coming up okay good excellent so so the
software<00:01:08.159> comes<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.909> does<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> its

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
software comes up it does all of its

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.670 
software comes up it does all of its
doohickeys<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.549> had<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> modify<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
doohickeys and I had to modify the the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.750 
doohickeys and I had to modify the the
other<00:01:13.680> gurbles<00:01:14.070> software<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.520> runs<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
other gurbles software that runs on the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.740 
other gurbles software that runs on the
raspberry<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.740> come<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.420> right<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.600> on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
raspberry to get to come up right up on

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.130 
raspberry to get to come up right up on
startup<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.939> when<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> machinist<00:01:21.540> use<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
startup so when a machinist use this you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.530 
startup so when a machinist use this you
doesn't<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> search<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> program

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
doesn't have to search for the program

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.070 
doesn't have to search for the program
it's<00:01:24.540> come<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> come<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.380> come<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's come and come and come and come and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.370 
it's come and come and come and come and
they're<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:29.420> that's<00:01:30.420> better<00:01:30.689> angle<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
they're just that's better angle so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.030 
they're just that's better angle so
software<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.479> click<00:01:34.189> open<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:36.020> it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
software is up click open and it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.899 
software is up click open and it
establishes<00:01:38.040> connection<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:40.430> let's<00:01:41.430> try<00:01:41.610> LG

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
establishes connection and let's try LG

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.910 
establishes connection and let's try LG
command<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.659> we've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.110> axis<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> think

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
command so we've got one axis I think

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.580 
command so we've got one axis I think
it's<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> Z<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.549> using<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.439> we're

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it's the Z we're using here and we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:58.480 
it's the Z we're using here and we're
gonna<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:48.500> don't<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.729> g0<00:01:52.820> 1z

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.020 

3.0<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.229> then<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> feed<00:02:01.950> rate<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.430> 20<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:05.030> that's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
3.0 and then a feed rate of 20 so that's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.370 
3.0 and then a feed rate of 20 so that's
what<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.270> got<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> screen<00:02:07.049> we're<00:02:07.290> gonna

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
what we got on the screen we're gonna

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.369 
what we got on the screen we're gonna
enter<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.799> into<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> buffer<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.379> we're

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
enter that into the buffer and we're

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.600 
enter that into the buffer and we're
gonna<00:02:10.530> see<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.860> she<00:02:10.890> does

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.550 

and<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:15.750> look<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.020> she's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and would you look at that she's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.320 
and would you look at that she's
spinning

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
spinning

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.210 
spinning
she<00:02:18.330> sounds<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.720> cool<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.660> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
she sounds all cool so right now and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.040 
she sounds all cool so right now and
stop<00:02:23.220> that's<00:02:23.400> good<00:02:23.670> right<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.840> got<00:02:24.960> the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
stop that's good right now you got the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.240 
stop that's good right now you got the
dip<00:02:25.230> switch<00:02:25.470> set<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.030> Oh<00:02:28.130> what<00:02:29.130> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
dip switch set so that it's Oh what is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.320 
dip switch set so that it's Oh what is
it<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:30.500> think<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> thousand<00:02:32.330> thousand

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it I think it's a thousand thousand

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.090 
it I think it's a thousand thousand
pulses<00:02:33.750> per<00:02:33.900> revolution<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.680> those<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.980> all

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
pulses per revolution so those are all
