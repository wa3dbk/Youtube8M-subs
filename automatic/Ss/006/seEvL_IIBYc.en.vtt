00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.570
 hi i'm fernando now let's see a 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.640
 qualifying round on the circuit of 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.130
 belgium spam 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.010
 this is the main straight we say 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.440
 with a fairly short straight because 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.600
 the first corner comes immediately, it's a curve 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.970
 very very slow in first gear now 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.379
 80 km per hour 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.280
 the exit of this curve is important 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 because now comes 17 seconds of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 full throttle 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.450
 passing from the mythical horus curve one 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.240
 uphill curve a right chicane 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.520
 left however not 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.720
 it's very complex these days 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.740
 formula 1 but a single 17 seconds hit 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.900
 At bottom 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.930
 then comes a combination of curves a 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.350
 right left right fast enough 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.030
 as 140 150 kilometers per hour and a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.670
 this point the circuit starts at 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.070
 getting off is all downhill first 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.590
 we come to a curve to the right very much 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.330
 long in third gear more or less immediately 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.140
 a very fast curve to the left 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.880
 around 190 200 kilometers per hour 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.550
 continue the descent of the circuit and now 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.710
 the two curves arrive faster than 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.920
 all the way around two left bends in 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.330
 sixth meeting 240 kilometers per hour and a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.800
 this point the circuit starts at 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.510
 go up a little to get to the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 latitude that we had at the beginning of the tour 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.979
 let's say a combination of curves and di 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.950
 very fast chicane always in fourth 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.619
 march around 160 170 kilometers 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 times and arrive after this curve a 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 right 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.680
 straight second longest straight 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.439
 of the whole circuit 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.360
 we arrive at the end of this straight 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.790
 still at 320 kilometers per hour 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.259
 passing from the curve blanc simon in 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.330
 full this we are now 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.340
 and we reach the last braking the last 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.140
 chicanes makes around 90 km 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 times so braking is very much 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.269
 important to use all the curb that 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.670
 then on this chicane and get to the 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.250
 finish line the circuit very fast and with 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.640
 curves sequences the very high curves 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.640
 speed
