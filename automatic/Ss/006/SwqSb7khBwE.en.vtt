00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
that you'll take the largest number on

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.710 
that you'll take the largest number on
the<00:00:25.110> TDC<00:00:25.500> lift<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:26.309> add<00:00:26.430> 60<00:00:26.910> thousandths<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the TDC lift and add 60 thousandths and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.400 
the TDC lift and add 60 thousandths and
then<00:00:28.380> check<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.360> space<00:00:30.360> between<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.989> valves

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
then check the space between the valves

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.190 
then check the space between the valves
on<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.430> particular<00:00:32.940> twin-cam<00:00:33.450> head<00:00:33.780> we're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on this particular twin-cam head we're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600 
on this particular twin-cam head we're
going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.500> using<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> 67<00:00:35.640> g<00:00:35.850> cam<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.610> TDC

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
going to be using a 67 g cam and the TDC

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.360 
going to be using a 67 g cam and the TDC
lift<00:00:39.060> is<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.450> two<00:00:39.660> hundred<00:00:39.720> nine<00:00:40.140> thousand<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
lift is of two hundred nine thousand and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.980 
lift is of two hundred nine thousand and
then<00:00:41.580> you<00:00:41.670> add<00:00:41.850> sixty<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.660> it'd<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.780> two

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
then you add sixty to it so it'd be two

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.320 
then you add sixty to it so it'd be two
hundred<00:00:43.080> sixty<00:00:43.650> nine<00:00:43.830> thousand<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:45.120> you'll

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
hundred sixty nine thousand what you'll

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.819 
hundred sixty nine thousand what you'll
do<00:00:45.630> is<00:00:46.290> you'll<00:00:46.620> take<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:48.110> drill<00:00:49.110> bar<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.650> we've

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
do is you'll take a drill bar like we've

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.290 
do is you'll take a drill bar like we've
got<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.579> two<00:00:50.730> hundred<00:00:50.790> sixty

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
got here and this is two hundred sixty

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200 
got here and this is two hundred sixty
five<00:00:51.480> thousand<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.560> you<00:00:52.740> try<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.040> run<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.060> in

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
five thousand and you try to run this in

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
five thousand and you try to run this in
between<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.350> head<00:00:55.560> here<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.880> has

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
between the head here to see if it has

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.050 
between the head here to see if it has
contact<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.010> has<00:00:59.190> contact<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.970> we're

address the problem one you can take and
drop<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.259> valve<00:01:07.470> seat<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:09.450> change<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.470> help

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
drop the valve seat in to change to help

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.030 
drop the valve seat in to change to help
get<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.420> TDC<00:01:12.420> left<00:01:12.659> clearance<00:01:13.050> or<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> other

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
get your TDC left clearance or the other

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640 
get your TDC left clearance or the other
thing<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> take<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thing you can do is you can take the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.670 
thing you can do is you can take the
valves<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.370> you<00:01:18.120> can<00:01:18.360> take<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> put<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> cut<00:01:19.440> on

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
valves and you can take and put a cut on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
valves and you can take and put a cut on
the<00:01:20.520> face<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> valves<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> they

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the face of the valves here so that they

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
the face of the valves here so that they
won't<00:01:22.320> rub<00:01:22.590> against<00:01:23.010> each<00:01:23.100> other<00:01:23.510> when<00:01:24.510> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
won't rub against each other when it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.850 
won't rub against each other when it
gets<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> TDC<00:01:25.290> lift<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.260> thing<00:01:28.440> I<00:01:28.560> want<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
gets to TDC lift the one thing I want to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.680 
gets to TDC lift the one thing I want to
make<00:01:29.010> sure<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> understand<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
make sure that you understand is that

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.940 
make sure that you understand is that
when<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.380> sync<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> valves<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.950> one

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
when we do sync the valves you do one

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.780 
when we do sync the valves you do one
loose<00:01:35.220> compression<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.960> other<00:01:37.080> thing<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
loose compression the other thing is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
loose compression the other thing is
bringing<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.119> valve<00:01:39.330> up<00:01:39.540> farther<00:01:39.950> changes

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
bringing the valve up farther changes

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280 
bringing the valve up farther changes
the<00:01:41.100> valve<00:01:41.310> protrusion<00:01:42.090> that's<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.930> distance

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the valve protrusion that's the distance

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.670 
the valve protrusion that's the distance
from<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.600> also<00:01:45.600> it'll<00:01:46.320> change

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
from here to here and also it'll change

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
from here to here and also it'll change
the<00:01:46.830> spring<00:01:47.189> pack<00:01:47.659> pressure<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.260> you'll

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the spring pack pressure so that you'll

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.609 
the spring pack pressure so that you'll
have<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.799> shim<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.150> bowels<00:01:51.150> and<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.260> adjust

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
have to shim the bowels and to adjust

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.480 
have to shim the bowels and to adjust
accordingly<00:01:53.479> another<00:01:54.479> way<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.250> lot<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
accordingly another way that lot of the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
accordingly another way that lot of the
aftermarket<00:01:57.000> heads<00:01:57.450> when<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:57.900> run<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> bigger

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
aftermarket heads when they run a bigger

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
aftermarket heads when they run a bigger
valve<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.100> they'll<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.700> they'll<00:01:59.970> have

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
valve in what they'll do is they'll have

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.410 
valve in what they'll do is they'll have
the<00:02:01.140> valve<00:02:01.380> guide<00:02:01.770> angle<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.549> they'll<00:02:03.150> move

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the valve guide angle here they'll move

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.320 
the valve guide angle here they'll move
it<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.380> two<00:02:04.409> degrees<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> we

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
it like one or two degrees so that we

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.399
