00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.259 

these<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.580> original<00:00:08.639> instructions

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
these are the original instructions

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.839 
these are the original instructions
which<00:00:09.840> come<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.559> lighter<00:00:11.219> spycam

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
which come with the lighter spycam

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.360 
which come with the lighter spycam
they're<00:00:12.719> written<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.290> Chinese<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.160> then

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
they're written in Chinese and then

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.250 
they're written in Chinese and then
translated<00:00:15.059> into<00:00:15.179> English<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> back<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
translated into English on the back the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
translated into English on the back the
translation<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.880> difficult<00:00:18.090> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
translation is really difficult to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.840 
translation is really difficult to
understand<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.920> recommend<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.609> use

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
understand so what I recommend is use

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.160 
understand so what I recommend is use
the<00:00:20.880> instructions<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.840> wrote

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the instructions that I wrote

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.460 
the instructions that I wrote
specifically<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.490> pen<00:00:23.730> cam<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.470> refer

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
specifically for this pen cam and refer

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
specifically for this pen cam and refer
to<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> original<00:00:26.279> Chinese<00:00:26.490> instructions

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to the original Chinese instructions

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
to the original Chinese instructions
only<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:28.050> technical<00:00:28.740> specifications<00:00:29.490> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
only for technical specifications and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359 
only for technical specifications and
that<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.970> thing<00:00:30.740> okay<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
that kind of thing okay so this is the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520 
that kind of thing okay so this is the
lighter<00:00:32.579> spy<00:00:32.969> camp<00:00:33.360> look<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.140> ordinary

hold the MFD button down for about two

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.999 
hold the MFD button down for about two
seconds<00:01:46.539> now<00:01:47.539> you<00:01:47.630> can<00:01:47.750> see<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.080> LED<00:01:48.259> comes<00:01:48.770> on

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
seconds now you can see the LED comes on

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.580 
seconds now you can see the LED comes on
and<00:01:49.280> then<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.789> goes<00:01:49.970> off<00:01:50.270> now<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.440> very

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
and then it goes off now this is very

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.080 
and then it goes off now this is very
important<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.130> understand<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.820> device

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
important to understand what the device

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.790 
important to understand what the device
is<00:01:53.270> doing<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.750> it's<00:01:53.899> actually<00:01:54.050> recording

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
is doing is it's actually recording

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.219 
is doing is it's actually recording
video<00:01:55.159> right<00:01:55.550> now<00:01:55.810> out<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.050> little

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
video right now out of the little

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.620 
video right now out of the little
pinhole<00:01:57.649> camera<00:01:58.039> lens<00:01:58.270> okay<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.360> what<00:01:59.509> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
pinhole camera lens okay and what the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.719 
pinhole camera lens okay and what the
device<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.170> doing<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:00.830> in<00:02:01.070> what's<00:02:01.460> called

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
device is doing is it's in what's called

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.749 
device is doing is it's in what's called
basically<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.540> stealth<00:02:03.049> video<00:02:03.710> audio<00:02:04.250> record

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
basically a stealth video audio record

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.359 
basically a stealth video audio record
mode<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.720> it's<00:02:05.840> actually<00:02:06.020> taking<00:02:06.590> video<00:02:06.979> right

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
mode so it's actually taking video right

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.050 
mode so it's actually taking video right
now<00:02:07.399> as<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.360> speak<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:09.579> that's<00:02:10.579> what<00:02:10.700> happens

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
now as we speak and that's what happens

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.370 
now as we speak and that's what happens
when<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.269> power<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.750> device<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
when you power on the device for the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.990 
when you power on the device for the
first<00:02:12.620> time<00:02:12.829> so<00:02:13.340> you'll<00:02:13.459> hold<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> button

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
first time so you'll hold the button

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.940 
first time so you'll hold the button
down<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.450> about<00:02:14.570> two<00:02:14.810> seconds<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.350> LED<00:02:15.680> comes

can't tell us recording video I can't
tell<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> device<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.410> tell<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.820> that's

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
tell but the device can tell so that's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.240 
tell but the device can tell so that's
what's<00:02:29.180> good<00:02:29.360> about<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.630> now<00:02:30.590> when<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> device

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
what's good about it now when the device

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.490 
what's good about it now when the device
is<00:02:31.310> recording<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.209> stealth<00:02:32.600> mode<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.380> is

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
is recording in stealth mode like it is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.380 
is recording in stealth mode like it is
right<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> will<00:02:34.430> continue<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.970> record

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
right now is it will continue to record

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.300 
right now is it will continue to record
video<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.930> audio<00:02:36.079> as<00:02:36.380> long<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:36.769> there's<00:02:36.950> noise

in<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.610> room<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.810> picks<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.170> noise<00:02:39.410> through

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829

that as long as there's noise that will

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.759 
that as long as there's noise that will
