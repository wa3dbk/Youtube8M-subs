00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
one of these pentalobe screw drivers

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.220 
one of these pentalobe screw drivers
it's<00:00:42.410> just<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.980> small<00:00:43.489> almost<00:00:44.480> like

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
it's just a small almost like

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.340 
it's just a small almost like
microscopic<00:00:46.160> point<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.940> they<00:00:47.930> fit<00:00:48.200> into

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
microscopic point and they fit into

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.310 
microscopic point and they fit into
those<00:00:48.620> tiny<00:00:49.250> two<00:00:49.610> tiny<00:00:49.880> screws<00:00:50.420> at<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.079> bottom

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
those tiny two tiny screws at the bottom

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.260 
those tiny two tiny screws at the bottom
of<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.680> phone<00:00:51.950> what<00:00:52.820> you're<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.120> want

to do is remove those screws and put

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.380 
to do is remove those screws and put
them<00:01:00.770> in<00:01:00.920> someplace<00:01:01.370> where<00:01:01.850> they<00:01:01.969> won't<00:01:02.000> get

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
them in someplace where they won't get

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.130 
them in someplace where they won't get
lost<00:01:07.270> most<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.450> time<00:01:08.630> when<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:08.899> get<00:01:08.990> these

lost most of the time when you get these
pentalobe<00:01:09.649> screw<00:01:09.920> drivers<00:01:10.340> they<00:01:10.940> are

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
pentalobe screw drivers they are

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.719 
pentalobe screw drivers they are
magnetic<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.380> there's<00:01:12.560> not<00:01:12.710> too<00:01:12.920> much<00:01:13.070> to

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
magnetic so there's not too much to

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.150 
magnetic so there's not too much to
worry<00:01:13.850> about<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:14.479> terms<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.320> losing<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.860> fault

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
worry about in terms of losing the fault

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.029 
worry about in terms of losing the fault
the<00:01:16.640> screws<00:01:17.030> for<00:01:17.600> example<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:18.259> magnetic

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
the screws for example this is magnetic

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.450 
the screws for example this is magnetic
and<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.670> catches<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.090> screw<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.010> take<00:01:22.310> it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
and it catches the screw now to take it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.210 
and it catches the screw now to take it
off<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.939> simply<00:01:23.150> slide<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.830> glass<00:01:24.830> up<00:01:25.130> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
off you simply slide the glass up and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.870 
off you simply slide the glass up and
lift<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.400> back<00:01:28.580> off<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.860> revealed<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.490> it

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
lift the back off and it revealed and it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.469 
lift the back off and it revealed and it
reveals<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.479> innards<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.259> phone<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:35.299> put

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
reveals the innards of the phone to put

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.890 
reveals the innards of the phone to put
