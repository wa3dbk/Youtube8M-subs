know it's very nice I think about

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.700

friends and exchanging gifts I think

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
friends and exchanging gifts I think
it's<00:01:29.490> become<00:01:29.820> too<00:01:30.030> commercialized<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.229> whole

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's become too commercialized the whole

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's become too commercialized the whole
spiritualism<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> whole<00:01:32.939> family<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
spiritualism the whole family the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
spiritualism the whole family the
meaning<00:01:34.409> behind<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> all<00:01:35.159> lost<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.850> dollar

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
meaning behind it is all lost to dollar

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
meaning behind it is all lost to dollar
signs<00:01:36.869> instead<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.159> love<00:01:38.610> hearts

and the time spent with ones we love it
used<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:43.579> giving<00:01:44.579> without<00:01:44.759> the
