00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.860
 Before you another proven variety 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.450
 apples varieties 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.969
 indeterminant but growing it in 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.390
 open ground 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.939
 form in 2 stalks you can grow it 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.310
 and in greenhouses and then there follows of course 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.480
 it is desirable to form in one stem 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:31.509
 I personally limited him in height 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:34.420
 here's a very interesting apple tree 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.530
 because in its beginning the leaves in general 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:43.900
 it looks like they have straight solitary 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:47.200
 such a form as a leaf I will be the fruit 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.150
 average size as you see the grade 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.820
 I have to ripen first here 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.390
 is starting to ripen first eat 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:01.840
 here are very fruitful forming quite 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 often such good brushes 9 to the very 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:10.299
 top and so now we will check 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.990
 the quality of the fruits of this beautiful 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.020
 variety recommends so let's see 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.700
 on the quality of bad apple varieties to tomato 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:27.880
 as you see is not very large but very 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:31.060
 solid here such it looks like but y 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.859
 I understand that I still haven't completely dospel 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.439
 it could have been longer 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.109
 hold so here is this place 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.880
 it will be natural too all pink 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:45.249
 colors there from just perfect for pickling 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.789
 here in any banks because the fruit is all 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:53.310
 ronning and here are the average values 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:56.139
 not small and not large, all the same 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.170
 fine pickled salt is very 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.409
 I recommend to taste too 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.409
 good
