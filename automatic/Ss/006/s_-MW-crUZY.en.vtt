00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.500
 Argentine punch is a cocktail that goes to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.150
 having an extralarge size was going to be 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.859
 ideal for those social gatherings where 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.109
 we see many friends if we do not want to spend 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 drinks all the time preparing the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.930

 with the procedure to do our 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.900
 Argentine punch this time I'm going to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.990
 wear gloves because the ice 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.740
 I directly grab it by hand 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.500
 we have a very large jar 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.020
 let's put two pieces of ice if 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.780
 they had a punch bowl with just freeze 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.430
 a tray we could have a bar 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.380
 a considerable size that we could 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.570
 directly add the punchbowl the 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.860
 jarra has something very interesting 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.140
 anyone can take the handle and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.360
 serve the drink what we are going to do 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.360
 is to add gin 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.259
 we will accompany it with the knob 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 we are going to add you to leave 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:48.810
 macerating a few pieces 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.869
 of cucumber and also some slices of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.869
 orange 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.609
 to complete we do it with a lime 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.609
 vile lemon 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.440
 this is our Argentine poncho already what 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 we have ready the only thing we have to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.150
 to do is wait for it to cool down and receive 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.530
 our friends in the living room of house I 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.740
 I'm waiting for my friends 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.910
 I put well in the glasses and I will serve 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.910
 the Argentine punch 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.470
 we're going to decorate it with a slice of 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.810
 cucumber 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.910
 so that it continues to add flavor and we are going 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.970
 to forget a touch a color with a 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.710
 cherry to the sea here not 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.710
