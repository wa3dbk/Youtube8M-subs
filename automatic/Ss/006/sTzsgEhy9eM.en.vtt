00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
worrying if if the extension would be

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.350 
worrying if if the extension would be
good<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.670> phony<00:02:47.940> style

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
good and I really like this phony style

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.140 
good and I really like this phony style
of<00:02:48.510> flipping<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.470> when<00:02:50.099> we<00:02:50.250> wear<00:02:50.459> down<00:02:50.790> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
of flipping it when we wear down the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.110 
of flipping it when we wear down the
neck<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.709> there<00:02:52.709> must<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.250> young<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:53.790> he

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
neck and there must be the young yeah he

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:05.200 
neck and there must be the young yeah he
does<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.750> yell<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.830> means<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.340> as

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:17.360 

so<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.540> cable<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:09.890> meter<00:03:10.890> long<00:03:16.040> meter<00:03:17.040> long

thought was the headband

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.500 
thought was the headband
actually<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> whole<00:03:50.280> headphone<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.090> feels<00:03:51.360> a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
actually the whole headphone it feels a

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.780 
actually the whole headphone it feels a
little<00:03:51.810> bit<00:03:52.110> tight<00:03:52.380> when<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.920> work<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.430> my<00:03:53.580> head

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
little bit tight when I work in my head

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.770 
little bit tight when I work in my head
actually<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.720> got<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.990> bigger<00:03:55.230> head<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.770> I

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
actually I got a bigger head that I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
actually I got a bigger head that I
think<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.900> will<00:03:57.959> get<00:03:58.200> used<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.709> and<00:04:01.190> the

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
think I will get used to it and the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.010 
think I will get used to it and the
cushion<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:03.650> comfortable<00:04:04.650> actually

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020

it's out over here at phone and it

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.229 
it's out over here at phone and it
completely<00:04:12.500> closes<00:04:13.500> your<00:04:13.860> ears<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:15.150> is

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.760 
hot when I wear it for more than five
minutes<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.690> think<00:04:21.930> I'll<00:04:22.049> get<00:04:22.230> used<00:04:22.470> to<00:04:22.650> it
