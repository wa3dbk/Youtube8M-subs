00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
a smear campaign against the Xbox

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.500 
a smear campaign against the Xbox
game<00:02:09.040> when<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.250> graphical<00:02:11.090> differences

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
game when the graphical differences

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.640 
game when the graphical differences
between<00:02:11.660> ps3<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.680> xbox<00:02:13.070> are<00:02:13.280> negligible<00:02:13.940> and

actually<00:02:15.650> Xbox<00:02:16.580> 360<00:02:17.030> games<00:02:17.210> are<00:02:17.390> less<00:02:17.570> likely

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
actually Xbox 360 games are less likely

to<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.260> glitches<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.370> them<00:02:19.550> because<00:02:19.820> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
to have glitches in them because the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.250 
to have glitches in them because the
Xbox<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.510> easy<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.990> program<00:02:21.140> for<00:02:21.530> than<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> ps3

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
Xbox is easy to program for than the ps3

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.840 
Xbox is easy to program for than the ps3
so<00:02:24.260> even<00:02:24.620> though<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.800> ps3<00:02:25.220> has<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.490> potential

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
so even though the ps3 has the potential

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.810 
so even though the ps3 has the potential
have<00:02:26.240> better-looking<00:02:27.140> games<00:02:27.640> when<00:02:28.640> game
