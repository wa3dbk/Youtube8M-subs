00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.670
 Of course you can actually think about it. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.730
 such from a very interesting point because 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.420
 that when someone comes from athletes 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.369
 bodybuilders on television see them 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.500

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 cleaned can be different mean 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 Karelia has an interview is necessary that he 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.870
 after all, that he was asked such a question who 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.750
 such a man who is he 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.820
 answered the man's soul is characterized by strength 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.439
 man is the one who is strong leading 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 surprised that he was just strong under 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.369
 the sun is divided just rude 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.600
 male physical strength already said that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.720

 friendship is such a strong soulful 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.390
 it is the quality that we are now very old and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.360
 go far yes look 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.990

 there is as it were understandable for the ordinary 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.710
 human goal his goal is to become the most 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.610

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.400
 be big everyone will understand something 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.349

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.840

 the greatest ones will be them 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.569
 it means there will be a prisoner not a sport 1 second 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.890
 they are not the biggest 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.110

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.790

 find your face look means there is such 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.230
 as a service this example you want to be 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.489
 strong do power extreme 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.489
 suppose to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.550
 do not even do power extreme 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.770
 to be strong before do it 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.740
 bodybuilding to be beautiful this 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.940
 controversial thesis let 's take now 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.850
 heavyweights there we take that audience 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.600
 those people who are on top 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.880
 bodybuilding yes there is an example there I don't know 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.580
 cutler yes there kalman well it's beautiful 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.170

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.080
 beautiful word 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.330
 mens-physicist want to be beautiful occupying 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.000
 simmons teaser 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.740
 body-building 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.260
 beauty is conditional understand it if 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.490
 Now I will say this force is also conditional 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.660
 concept you can be engaged 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.920
 power extremes may be charged 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.640
 weightlifting can and matzo 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.020
 arm wrestling there is such a very 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.340
 good ones 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.100
 of king very good phrase very 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:19.150
 good concepts if you want to sell 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.620
 the film you have to say its essence alone 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.930
 a sentence if you can't express 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.030
 clear and incendiary essence of the film 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.860
 you have no movie in one sentence 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.040
 not the scenario we have bodybuilding we 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.020
 we want to sell it up to 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.300
 honestly beauty does not give in to that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.190
 the dispute begins and say so as not to 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:45.640
 was controversy I do not know when that 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.940
 me with rhymes don't come i can 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.360
 to speculate on this topic then 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.210
 me personally 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.910
 I think that to anyone. 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.120
 bodybuilder if someone calls 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.430
 a monster or even freecom he only 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.370
 will be glad at least i'm when i'm here 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.400
 let's go in the summer go to the mall 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.690
 there mega let's say dates i go here 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.390
 really phreak here and people come from 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.810
 it looks so they disappear gift 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.790
 speeches 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.830
 Others are suitable, they can be like this 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.140
 touch that is how many people there are 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.350
 who read something beautiful maybe 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.860
 and we do not know, I think units 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.150
 offer is counting on trial 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:37.349
 viewers want to dominate in doing 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:41.789
 bodybuilding here agree yes and 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.949
 agree why because they themselves here 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.530
 let's say if you take big bodybuilders 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.219
 healthy people just in shape if 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.550
 they are dominator me to some 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.560
 people who start rumors 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.990
 start there somewhere on the sly poke 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.099
 they thereby raise us even higher 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:05.550
 begin to humiliate themselves so all the same 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.810
 yes this dominance is beautiful 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.289
 big body 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.889
 I mean beautiful big is not easy 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.710
 beautiful and this is probably yes dominator and 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.650

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:27.810
 ugly we said our version for 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.039
 you in the competition continues to do 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.029
 small current we know what to become 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.009
 the strongest 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:39.039
 need to do power extreme off 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.469
 we would come to you yourself to conclude that 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.169
