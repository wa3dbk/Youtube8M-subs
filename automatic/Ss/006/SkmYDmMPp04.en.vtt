our 3d assets from or we just use our
heads

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.240 

one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> major<00:00:45.270> turning<00:00:45.629> points

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
one of the major turning points

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.529 
one of the major turning points
especially<00:00:47.250> while<00:00:47.550> growing<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.910> was

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
especially while growing up was

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
especially while growing up was
definitely<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.289> choice<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.980> made<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
definitely a choice that I made when I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.720 
definitely a choice that I made when I
was<00:00:50.910> studying<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:51.750> a-levels<00:00:52.460> to<00:00:53.460> change

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
was studying my a-levels to change

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
was studying my a-levels to change
subjects<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.870> initially<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.649> chose<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.399> do

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
subjects because initially I chose to do

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
subjects because initially I chose to do
business<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.379> yeah<00:00:58.379> no<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:59.219> exactly<00:00:59.399> art

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
business to this yeah no not exactly art

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590 
business to this yeah no not exactly art
based<00:01:00.020> main<00:01:01.020> reason<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:02.510> sort<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
based main reason was that was sort of

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
based main reason was that was sort of
lost<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> passion<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> art

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
lost a bit of passion for the art

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.820 
lost a bit of passion for the art
because<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.049> lack<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> support<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because of the lack of support that I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.910 
because of the lack of support that I
was<00:01:07.920> having<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.460> from<00:01:08.850> school<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.360> terms<00:01:09.659> of

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
was having from from school in terms of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
was having from from school in terms of
art<00:01:10.920> teaching<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.520> stuff<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> but

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
art teaching and stuff like that but

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.789 
art teaching and stuff like that but
yeah<00:01:13.080> si<00:01:14.040> de<00:01:14.100> dat<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.840> found

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
yeah si de dat you know I really found

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.740 
yeah si de dat you know I really found
that<00:01:16.950> passion<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.610> art<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.420> decided

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that passion again for art so I decided

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.190 
that passion again for art so I decided
to<00:01:18.930> completely<00:01:19.350> scrap<00:01:20.250> business<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.200> go

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
to completely scrap business to this go

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.310 
to completely scrap business to this go
back<00:01:22.380> study<00:01:23.310> art<00:01:23.549> again<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.140> I'd

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
back study art again and I think if I'd

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
back study art again and I think if I'd
have<00:01:25.470> done<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.520> wouldn't<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
have done that like I wouldn't I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.160 
have done that like I wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.049> now<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.930> remember<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
wouldn't be here now see I remember the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.190 
wouldn't be here now see I remember the
first<00:01:31.320> game<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.860> watched<00:01:32.340> seen<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.390> father

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
first game I watched seen as my father

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.080 
first game I watched seen as my father
was<00:01:34.530> indie<00:01:35.040> games<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.430> worse<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
was indie games as worse it was more of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.440 
was indie games as worse it was more of
a<00:01:36.119> case<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.450> me<00:01:36.630> taking<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.680> step<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
a case of me taking a step back in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
a case of me taking a step back in
watching<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.930> yeah<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> was<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.189> was

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
watching it I think yeah it was a it was

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.420 
watching it I think yeah it was a it was
ghostbusters<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.329> Commodore<00:01:42.930> 64<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> yeah

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
ghostbusters on the Commodore 64 so yeah

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
ghostbusters on the Commodore 64 so yeah
quite<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> long<00:01:44.850> time<00:01:45.030> ago<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.689> early<00:01:46.140> eighties

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
quite a long time ago so early eighties

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.710 
quite a long time ago so early eighties
so<00:01:46.649> yeah<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.280> probably<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> first

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
so yeah that was probably the first

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.649 
so yeah that was probably the first
first<00:01:48.720> memory<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:50.509> computer<00:01:51.509> games

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
first memory I have of of computer games

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
first memory I have of of computer games
from<00:01:52.229> an<00:01:52.350> early<00:01:52.560> age<00:01:52.590> I'm<00:01:52.860> always<00:01:53.070> loved<00:01:53.250> games

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
from an early age I'm always loved games

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.800 
from an early age I'm always loved games
but<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> didn't<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.540> it'd<00:01:54.720> be

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
but I didn't actually think it'd be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
but I didn't actually think it'd be
possible<00:01:54.960> sort<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> said

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
possible sort of it's like a like I said

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.350 
possible sort of it's like a like I said
earlier<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> dream<00:01:57.600> job<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:59.210> some<00:02:00.210> people

earlier it's a dream job so some people

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
earlier it's a dream job so some people
dream<00:02:00.960> about<00:02:00.990> being<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> pop<00:02:01.530> star<00:02:01.649> some<00:02:02.070> people
