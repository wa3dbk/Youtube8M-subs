g.skill ripjaw memory should do fine

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
g.skill ripjaw memory should do fine
it's<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> same<00:01:02.969> speed<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> others

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it's the same speed as all the others

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's the same speed as all the others
we're<00:01:04.199> comparing<00:01:04.500> against<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.060> pretty

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
we're comparing against so it's pretty

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.070

good it's a steal at $41 now we have the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
good it's a steal at $41 now we have the
