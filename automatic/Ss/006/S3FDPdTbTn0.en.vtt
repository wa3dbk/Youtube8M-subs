00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.060

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.670
 the only one in Latin America and in Colombia 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.290
 it was the first do the double backflip 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.830
 Cali writes the first in 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.830
 cover it 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.800
 it's an acrobatics that's called the double 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.320
 Backflip consists of making two twists 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850
 deadly back is one of the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.310
 most dangerous acrobatics of this 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.780
 sport I am currently the only one that 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.550
 makes in Latin America the first person 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.700
 what injury Colombia have had the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.430
 opportunity to 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.080
 and travel with this approval I have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.800
 invited to participate in the most events 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 important in Latin America 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.910
 of the few people who make them in 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.680
 the world is me and there is a person who 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.380
 It was the first one made by a person 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.110
 from england and in 2010 competing 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.200
 in the USA doing the quadriplegic 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.730
 then as an athlete you have a lot 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.040
 respect 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.380
 and try not to mess with this 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.370
 but I wanted to improve myself 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.530
 take the level to an end more more 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.800
 high and risk me and well there they are 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.800
 the results 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.330
 but they are already in a box full of 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 foams where some jump make the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.110
 acrobatics and if things go wrong then 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 fall into the foam and do not give up you're not going 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 to spend nothing 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 imagine if you look for head right in 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.840
 the leg as you stay in colombia not what 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.580
 There is, well, what a pity because this is a 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.580
 sport that you like a lot of people 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.190
 we here at cali started as 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
 we are pioneers here in the city and in 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.260
 colombia about 15 years ago as I was saying 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.660
 and we started here before here there was this 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 space here is all like a green zone 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.379
 that is abandoned and with about 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.599
 colleagues who are already like 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.799
 retired from the sport we started we can 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.620
 learn how the tracks were made 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.730
 taking a jump another jump and with the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.950
 over the years we see ourselves as 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.620
 specializing the site was fought 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.620
 also little people support 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.670
 ace
