00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.080
 In this tutorial you will learn to create a 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.480
 effect on a photograph as if it were a 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.540
 pencil sketch let's add a 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 artistic effect and a mode of fusion in 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.790
 a duplicate layer something very easy to 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.130
 perform first let's double the 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.050
 image of the layer the only one that exists 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.370
 currently in the layers panel 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.370
 select or touch the plus sign 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:37.040
 we select duplicate layer after the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.010
 button done we already have selected 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.649
 automatically in the top layer and what 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.559
 What we are going to do now is add a 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.530
 artistic effect called pencil we enter 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.359
 in the effects menu in the section of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.749
 artistic and we select the pencil 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:59.269
 we are seeing that we can choose two 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.729
 colors to simulate in this case the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.260
 pencil drawing effect form 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.120
 default colors appear 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.729
 black and white you can select 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.150
 any of them but I 'm going to 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.909
 leave 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.370
 so below we see where it says this size 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.330
 is to select the size of the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.300
 tracings simulate that the tip of the pencil 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.400
 that was used is thinner or thicker 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.080
 according to the case and in threshold also 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.540
 we can modify this option that 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.000
 basically refers to the contrast that goes 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.860
 to have between the two colors that 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.470
 we chose at the top in this 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.470
 case the black and the white we are going to 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.750
 leave at 50% and once we apply the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.550
 changes we are seeing how it looks and why 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.040
 last let's change the mode of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.040
 merge to the top layer that is to the 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.900
 which we apply the pencil effect to 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.350
 mode of fusion refers to the way 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.780
 that the colors of the layers interact 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.090
 contiguous in this case as it goes to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.760
 interact the top layer with the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 bottom that is the original layer 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.610
 we select this icon and where it says in 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.070
 fusion mode we will be able to select 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.440
 between several of the ones you're seeing 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.020
 although the adobe tutorial mentions that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.960
 select the option to overlay if 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.810
 I select what we superimpose 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.970
 happens we can experiment with the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.480
 other modes of fusion and we're going to have 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.670
 different types of effects I'm going to 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.130
 let on superimpose and simply 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.740
 we play outside this little box 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.980
 so that it disappears and we already have the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.720
 pencil sketch effect of an image 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 We can do it of course with 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.700
 any image that comes to mind in my 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.990
 case I used the one they originally used 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.990
 in the tutorial
