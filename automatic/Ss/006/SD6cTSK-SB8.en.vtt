00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.939
 i 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:13.809
 I think the audience is going to love this 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:17.550
 character not because it's me but 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.529
 because it falls here already has a lot of power 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.509
 he has a lot of autonomy has a lot 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.710
 decision within the within 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:29.439
 history and its presences or its uses 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.910
 interventions in each scene are 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.890
 punctual short but very intense and for 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.829
 that I feel that it's going to be a character 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.519
 unforgettable 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.339
 the justiciero like that they are under 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.850
 her rules because she is the goddess of the 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.239
 land and also the water then for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 pa to be able to pass any authority 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.449
 they have to ask her permission but 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 if that law is violated at any time 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.600
 she has in her kingdom 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.600
 she will do justice no matter how 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.060
 I am having more fun because he 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.550
 rehearsed first how one is awkward in the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.950
 dance I imagine that all my 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.800
 dancers who are behind all my 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.710
 roommates plus my teacher 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.350
 Paula must be having a lot of fun 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.180
 with the things that I do because the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.170
 first steps are super clumsy and you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.170
 you know how a robot 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 the production team and the directors 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.160
 of actors within the production 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 They are also very cool, they all have 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.800
 that point or that common factor that is like 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.350
 the good wave the good energy and the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 willingness to do a good job and that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.979
 It is beautiful everything that works with good 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.479
 energy on stage feels and the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.220
 people perceive it receives them and applauds 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.290
 pirate of mermaids the heart of neptune 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.810
 It is ideal for children and family 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.110
 complete go see it for a simple 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.050
 reason in these times lack the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.410
 productions for children lack the 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 interesting children's proposals for 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 that children develop values â€‹â€‹and in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.650
 this case with art with a super 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.680
 stage of the theater with a 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.140
 overproduction behind a wonderful 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.510
 wardrobe and a great will of all 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.510
 the actors and those who are involved 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.060
 I think it's the best way for a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.900
 full family receive through 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.739
 art and fun a nice message 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.739
 but I want our is to shut up 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.290
 better go to the theater
