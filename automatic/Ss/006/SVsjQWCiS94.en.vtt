can see up here a drywall joint is

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.169 
can see up here a drywall joint is
wherever<00:00:07.950> you've<00:00:08.189> got<00:00:08.220> two<00:00:08.670> pieces<00:00:08.880> of

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
wherever you've got two pieces of

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.940 
wherever you've got two pieces of
drywall<00:00:09.420> coming<00:00:10.019> together<00:00:10.260> or<00:00:10.500> you've<00:00:10.710> got<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
drywall coming together or you've got a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.700 
drywall coming together or you've got a
crack<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.400> your<00:00:12.090> drywall<00:00:12.389> now<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
crack in your drywall now this is

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.079 
crack in your drywall now this is
something<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.070> can't<00:00:14.280> mud<00:00:14.700> over

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
something you just can't mud over

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.540 
something you just can't mud over
because<00:00:15.480> eventually<00:00:16.190> just<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.340> house

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
because eventually just with house

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.189 
because eventually just with house
settling<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.390> different<00:00:18.720> things<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
settling and different things and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.310 
settling and different things and
vibrations<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.010> happen<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> house<00:00:20.640> if

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
vibrations that happen in the house if

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
vibrations that happen in the house if
you<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.650> put<00:00:22.859> mud<00:00:23.100> over<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.880> line

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
you just put mud over this this line

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.019 
you just put mud over this this line
would<00:00:24.720> show<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.230> again<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> crack<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.849> what

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
would show up again as a crack so what

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.670 
would show up again as a crack so what
we've<00:00:27.180> got<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.779> we've<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.289> tape<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
we've got to do is we've got to tape it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
we've got to do is we've got to tape it
now<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.460> method<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> use<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.599> using

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
now the first method we can use is using

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
now the first method we can use is using
a<00:00:30.960> fiberglass<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:32.309> I've<00:00:32.489> already<00:00:32.700> got<00:00:32.820> in

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a fiberglass which I've already got in

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.270 
a fiberglass which I've already got in
place<00:00:33.210> here<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:34.020> fiberglass<00:00:34.680> tape<00:00:34.980> has<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
place here this fiberglass tape has a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
place here this fiberglass tape has a
little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> adhesive<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> back<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit of adhesive on the back of it

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.979 
little bit of adhesive on the back of it
so<00:00:37.670> without<00:00:38.670> anything<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> wall<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.960> just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so without anything on the wall you just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
so without anything on the wall you just
apply<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.710> directly<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> crack<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
apply it directly over that crack and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.170 
apply it directly over that crack and
press<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.780> place<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.940> take<00:00:45.120> our

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
press it in place and then we take our

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.020 
press it in place and then we take our
joint<00:00:45.629> compound<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:47.100> put<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> layer<00:00:47.610> over

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
joint compound and we put a layer over

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.990 
joint compound and we put a layer over
it<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.680> then<00:00:49.680> take<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> broad<00:00:50.309> knife<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it and then take a broad knife and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.689 
it and then take a broad knife and
scrape<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> second<00:00:53.160> method<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
scrape that off now the second method is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.569 
scrape that off now the second method is
to<00:00:54.180> use<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.840> paper<00:00:55.379> tape<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:56.280> when<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.550> use

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to use the paper tape now when we use

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
to use the paper tape now when we use
the<00:00:56.910> paper<00:00:57.120> tape<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> take

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the paper tape we actually got to take

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.599 
the paper tape we actually got to take
our<00:00:59.010> drywall<00:00:59.520> mud<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:01.039> we<00:01:02.039> need<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
our drywall mud and we need to put the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
our drywall mud and we need to put the
layer<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.510> first<00:01:03.780> time<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
layer in the first time we put this on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.390 
layer in the first time we put this on
we<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.309> want<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> work<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.979> down<00:01:07.979> into

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
we actually want to work it down into

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.200 
we actually want to work it down into
the<00:01:08.490> crack<00:01:12.530> scraping<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> smooth<00:01:14.030> such<00:01:15.030> as

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the crack scraping it smooth such as

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.770 
the crack scraping it smooth such as
this<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:17.430> you're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> use<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.540> two

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

a thin coat over the crack and once we

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.569 
a thin coat over the crack and once we
got<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.939> thin<00:01:30.240> coat<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.689> place<00:01:31.430> then<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> can

got that thin coat in place then we can

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.399 
got that thin coat in place then we can
come<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.180> our<00:01:33.210> tape<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.110> press

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
come back with our tape and we can press

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.520 
come back with our tape and we can press
this<00:01:37.650> tape<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:40.530> place<00:01:41.509> now<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.780> case<00:01:43.020> tape

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
this tape in place now in this case tape

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.310 
this tape in place now in this case tape
was<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.000> little<00:01:45.000> bit<00:01:45.090> longer<00:01:45.390> than<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> drywall

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
was a little bit longer than the drywall

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.310 
was a little bit longer than the drywall
so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.860> ripped<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.189> off<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> once<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so I just ripped it off and once that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.630 
so I just ripped it off and once that
tape<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> place<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
tape is in place now I'm going to take a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.819 
tape is in place now I'm going to take a
wider<00:01:51.000> knife<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.600> six<00:01:51.869> inch<00:01:52.049> broad<00:01:52.350> knife<00:01:52.619> in

this case and then I'm going to press
that<00:01:59.009> tape<00:01:59.509> down<00:02:00.509> into<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> drywall<00:02:01.439> mud<00:02:03.380> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that tape down into the drywall mud and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
that tape down into the drywall mud and
I'll<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.189> down

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I'll do it going down
