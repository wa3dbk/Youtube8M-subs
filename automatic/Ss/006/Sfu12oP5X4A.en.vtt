00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you know there's there's going to be

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.280 
you know there's there's going to be
some<00:02:02.490> talk<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.540> coming<00:02:03.930> weeks<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
some talk in the in the coming weeks and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.620 
some talk in the in the coming weeks and
months<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.979> xbox<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.000> ready<00:02:06.360> but

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
months if the xbox one is ready but

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.469 
months if the xbox one is ready but
apparently<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.170> terms<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.530> overheating

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
apparently in terms of overheating

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
apparently in terms of overheating
concerns<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.810> xbox<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.530> actually<00:02:11.069> has<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
concerns the xbox one actually has a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.250 
concerns the xbox one actually has a
technology<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.750> regard

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
technology and regard

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.229 
technology and regard
to<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.920> starts<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.370> overheat<00:02:14.549> or<00:02:14.909> things

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
to when it starts to overheat or things

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.839 
to when it starts to overheat or things
start<00:02:15.480> getting<00:02:15.569> hot<00:02:16.069> it'll<00:02:17.069> actually<00:02:17.370> track

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
start getting hot it'll actually track

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.929 
start getting hot it'll actually track
down<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.480> issue<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.560> dial<00:02:20.010> dial<00:02:20.579> back<00:02:20.879> the

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
down that issue and dial dial back the

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.390 
down that issue and dial dial back the
power<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.810> i'm<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.439> sure<00:02:22.680> i'm<00:02:22.829> guessing<00:02:23.280> if

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
power so i'm not sure i'm guessing if

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.949 
power so i'm not sure i'm guessing if
you're<00:02:23.519> playing<00:02:23.879> a<00:02:24.030> game<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.659> running

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
you're playing a game and it's running

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.800 
you're playing a game and it's running
at<00:02:25.079> 60<00:02:25.590> frames<00:02:25.620> per<00:02:26.010> second<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.450> know<00:02:27.629> it

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
at 60 frames per second and you know it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780 
at 60 frames per second and you know it
and<00:02:27.989> things<00:02:28.290> start<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.530> get<00:02:28.680> hot<00:02:29.010> i<00:02:29.310> don't<00:02:29.730> know

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and things start to get hot i don't know

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.640 
and things start to get hot i don't know
i'm<00:02:29.970> guessing<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.569> goes<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.440> machine

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
i'm guessing it goes into the machine

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.289 
i'm guessing it goes into the machine
doll<00:02:31.860> snapback<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.610> power<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
doll snapback the power and the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.089 
doll snapback the power and the
performance<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.379> going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> little<00:02:34.920> bit

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
performance is going to be a little bit

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.160 
performance is going to be a little bit
less<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.549> gonna<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.629> at<00:02:36.840> 60<00:02:37.140> frames

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
less you're gonna not have at 60 frames

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the failure rates for the overheating

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
the failure rates for the overheating
issues<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.650> looks<00:02:46.859> like<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> xbox<00:02:47.730> one<00:02:48.120> and
