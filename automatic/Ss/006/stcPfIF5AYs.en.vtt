00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
I've just mostly wiped the product off

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.280 
I've just mostly wiped the product off
if<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.330> mixes<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.810> with<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.200> really

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
if it mixes in with this it really

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.750 
if it mixes in with this it really
doesn't<00:02:30.680> matter<00:02:30.740> since<00:02:31.040> it's<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
doesn't matter since it's going to the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.760 
doesn't matter since it's going to the
slick<00:02:32.030> same<00:02:32.300> color<00:02:32.570> anyways<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.320> I'm<00:02:33.590> just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
slick same color anyways and I'm just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.320 
slick same color anyways and I'm just
going<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.040> start<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.460> at<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> very<00:02:35.030> outer

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
going to start this at the very outer

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.920 
going to start this at the very outer
corner<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> eyes<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:38.240> will<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.690> our

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
corner of the eyes and this will be our

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.260 
corner of the eyes and this will be our
outer<00:02:39.200> corner<00:02:39.680> defining<00:02:40.130> color<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:43.210> then<00:02:44.210> I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
outer corner defining color and then I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.110 
outer corner defining color and then I
will<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:45.020> blend<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.040> crease<00:02:46.520> all<00:02:46.790> together

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
will just blend this crease all together

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.510 
will just blend this crease all together
so<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.020> just<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.590> know<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:49.190> brown

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
so it is not just you know to brown

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.780 
so it is not just you know to brown
lines<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:53.950> find<00:02:54.950> sometimes<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
lines I find sometimes that the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.970 
lines I find sometimes that the
champagne<00:02:56.390> color<00:02:56.690> can<00:02:56.990> get<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.260> bit<00:02:57.470> lost<00:02:57.740> and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
champagne color can get a bit lost and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.620 
champagne color can get a bit lost and
not<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.370> I<00:02:58.400> am<00:02:58.610> just<00:02:58.700> taking<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.270> little<00:02:59.300> bit

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
not so I am just taking a little bit
