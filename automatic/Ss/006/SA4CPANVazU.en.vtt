maybe a little longer unfortunately I
wish<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.410> were<00:00:25.560> longer<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.730> varieties

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
wish it were longer there are varieties

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.200 
wish it were longer there are varieties

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
way but Murray CI is probably about a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600 
way but Murray CI is probably about a
month<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.140> months<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> longest<00:00:35.340> in

the spring and it is a it it has these
lovely<00:00:40.200> horizontal<00:00:41.190> branches<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.500> make<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
lovely horizontal branches that make it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040 
lovely horizontal branches that make it
very<00:00:43.680> distinctive<00:00:44.670> looking<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> flowers<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050

like a lace cap hydrangea so in the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
like a lace cap hydrangea so in the
center<00:00:52.829> those<00:00:53.039> small<00:00:53.430> flowers<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.140> real

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
that's where the double-file name comes

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.440 
that's where the double-file name comes
from<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.509> also<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:16.080> these<00:01:16.290> really<00:01:16.740> nice

garden soil and average to moderate
water<00:02:21.470> when<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.500> don't<00:02:22.860> give<00:02:23.459> these<00:02:23.610> enough

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
water when I don't give these enough

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.500 
water when I don't give these enough
water<00:02:24.360> they<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.799> leaf<00:02:26.010> margins<00:02:26.640> burn<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.299> have

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
water they the leaf margins burn we have

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.960 
water they the leaf margins burn we have
very<00:02:27.750> low<00:02:28.049> humidity<00:02:28.260> where<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:28.860> live<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:29.909> I

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
very low humidity where I live but I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
very low humidity where I live but I
think<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.810> lived<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.290> an<00:02:31.409> area<00:02:31.620> with

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
think if you lived in an area with

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.399 
think if you lived in an area with
higher<00:02:32.159> humidity<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:33.120> would<00:02:33.359> be<00:02:33.510> full<00:02:33.959> fine

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
higher humidity these would be full fine

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.819 
higher humidity these would be full fine
in<00:02:34.680> full<00:02:34.980> Sun<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:36.299> I've<00:02:36.989> seen<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.439> in<00:02:37.590> full

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
in full Sun and I've seen them in full

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.250 
in full Sun and I've seen them in full
Sun<00:02:37.859> in<00:02:38.280> my<00:02:38.459> area<00:02:38.849> but<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.109> got

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
Sun in my area but then you really got

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.679 
Sun in my area but then you really got
to<00:02:40.290> keep<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.739> water<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.129> them<00:02:41.459> for<00:02:42.269> them<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.450> be

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
to keep the water in them for them to be

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.640 
to keep the water in them for them to be
able<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.959> handle<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:44.629> deer<00:02:45.629> typically<00:02:46.349> leave

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
able to handle that deer typically leave

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.849 
able to handle that deer typically leave
this<00:02:46.889> by<00:02:47.159> Burnham<00:02:47.639> family<00:02:48.090> alone<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.930> they're

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
this by Burnham family alone so they're

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.970 
this by Burnham family alone so they're
worth<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.310> try<00:02:50.609> in<00:02:50.970> Deer<00:02:51.389> areas<00:02:51.870> these<00:02:52.530> are<00:02:52.590> not

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
worth a try in Deer areas these are not

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.949 
worth a try in Deer areas these are not
drought<00:02:53.340> tolerant<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.209> you're<00:02:54.450> thinking<00:02:54.840> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
drought tolerant if you're thinking of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.119 
drought tolerant if you're thinking of
using<00:02:55.349> them<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> way<00:02:57.079> at<00:02:58.079> least<00:02:58.379> not<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.680> our

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
using them that way at least not in our

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.539 
using them that way at least not in our
area<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.670> very<00:02:59.939> low<00:03:00.269> humidity<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.220> think

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
area with very low humidity and I think

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.759 
area with very low humidity and I think
that's<00:03:02.819> about<00:03:03.060> full<00:03:03.599> Sun<00:03:04.879> except<00:03:05.879> again<00:03:06.299> in

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
that's about full Sun except again in

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.470 
that's about full Sun except again in
areas<00:03:07.769> where<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.220> have<00:03:08.459> low<00:03:08.790> humidity<00:03:09.450> and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
areas where you have low humidity and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.410 
areas where you have low humidity and
high<00:03:09.900> heat<00:03:10.489> that's<00:03:11.489> what<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.819> can<00:03:12.120> tell<00:03:12.359> you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
high heat that's what I can tell you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.080 
high heat that's what I can tell you
