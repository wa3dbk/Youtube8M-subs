so<00:00:04.080> i<00:00:04.110> renamed<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.890> instead<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.580> snow

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
so i renamed it instead of the snow

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.240 
so i renamed it instead of the snow
plane<00:00:06.060> it's<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.480> Snowbird<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.980> ski

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
plane it's the Snowbird like the ski

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.440 
plane it's the Snowbird like the ski
resort<00:00:08.280> over<00:00:09.059> there<00:00:09.769> but<00:00:10.769> anyways<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:12.030> done

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
resort over there but anyways it's done

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.580 
resort over there but anyways it's done
it<00:00:13.049> took<00:00:13.320> me<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:14.370> went<00:00:14.519> from<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:15.150> idea<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it took me it went from an idea to a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.210 
it took me it went from an idea to a
plane<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.580> afternoon<00:00:18.710> it's<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
plane in one afternoon it's not that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.750 
plane in one afternoon it's not that
hard<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> build<00:00:20.939> oh<00:00:22.220> it's<00:00:23.220> finished<00:00:23.519> air

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
hard to build oh it's finished air

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.820 
hard to build oh it's finished air
intake<00:00:24.859> be<00:00:25.859> sucking<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.490> snow<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> all

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
intake be sucking in snow this is all

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.080 
intake be sucking in snow this is all
smooth<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.640> goes<00:00:29.789> back<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.269> their<00:00:30.539> oh<00:00:30.890> I

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
smooth that goes back into their oh I

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
smooth that goes back into their oh I
thought<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.690> wing<00:00:33.870> struts<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
thought I got little wing struts on it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.160 
thought I got little wing struts on it
the<00:00:35.100> wing<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:36.380> it's<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> nice<00:00:37.770> airfoil

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
the wing is on it's got a nice airfoil

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.670 
the wing is on it's got a nice airfoil
you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.379> see<00:00:40.559> ailerons<00:00:41.340> rudder<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.680> thrust

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you can see ailerons rudder the thrust

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.350 
you can see ailerons rudder the thrust
vectoring<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> servos<00:00:44.820> are<00:00:45.000> hooked<00:00:45.180> up

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
vectoring all the servos are hooked up

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.459 
vectoring all the servos are hooked up
and<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.079> wires<00:00:46.289> go<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> someone

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and the wires go in there and someone

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400 
and the wires go in there and someone
said<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.579> horizontal<00:00:51.570> stabilizer<00:00:52.079> was

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
said the the horizontal stabilizer was

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.709 
said the the horizontal stabilizer was
too<00:00:52.590> small<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.180> I'll<00:00:54.449> put<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
too small I don't know how I'll put it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
too small I don't know how I'll put it
on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> ground<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:56.300> oh<00:00:59.390> I<00:01:00.390> don't

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
on the ground so you can see oh I don't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.429 
on the ground so you can see oh I don't
think<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.050> bad<00:01:02.930> because<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
think it's that bad because it's got a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
think it's that bad because it's got a
big<00:01:04.739> vertical<00:01:05.040> stabilizer<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.390> also

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
big vertical stabilizer and that also

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
big vertical stabilizer and that also
does<00:01:09.840> star<00:01:10.049> spectrum<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.610> bottom<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
does star spectrum so on the bottom I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.749 
does star spectrum so on the bottom I
put<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.200> strip<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.590> clear<00:01:16.830> tape<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
put a strip of clear tape over the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.690 
put a strip of clear tape over the
bottom<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.270> slide<00:01:18.689> better<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.369> now<00:01:20.369> talk

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
bottom so it slide better and now talk

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.649 
bottom so it slide better and now talk
about<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> electronics<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.960> stuff<00:01:22.110> oh

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
about all the electronics and stuff oh

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.010 
about all the electronics and stuff oh
it<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.750> my<00:01:24.780> hand<00:01:25.170> over<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> mic<00:01:28.340> anyways<00:01:30.020> this

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it was my hand over the mic anyways this

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
it was my hand over the mic anyways this
is<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.380> battery<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.220> where<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> battery

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
is the battery this is where the battery

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.740 
is the battery this is where the battery
goes<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> since<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> battery<00:01:35.880> batteries<00:01:36.570> are

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
goes and since the battery batteries are

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.340 
goes and since the battery batteries are
sealed<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.950> they're<00:01:38.189> waterproof<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.350> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
sealed like they're waterproof so this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
sealed like they're waterproof so this
little<00:01:40.740> part<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.119> waterproof

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
little part is not all that waterproof

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.100 
little part is not all that waterproof
because<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.560> door<00:01:44.000> right<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.960> then

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
because of this door right here but then

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.760 
because of this door right here but then
the<00:01:46.350> battery<00:01:46.680> wires<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.649> sweep<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the battery wires go in a sweep this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.030 
the battery wires go in a sweep this
works<00:01:50.009> night<00:01:50.939> vision<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.540> battery<00:01:52.470> wires<00:01:52.680> go

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
works night vision on battery wires go

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
works night vision on battery wires go
into<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.659> sealed<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
into there and that's all sealed and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.380 
into there and that's all sealed and
that<00:01:55.770> leads<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.729> whole<00:01:57.000> compartment

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that leads to this whole compartment

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.370 
that leads to this whole compartment
down<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> has<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> ESC<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
down here and that has the ESC and the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.240 
down here and that has the ESC and the
receiver<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.310> that's<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.759> sealed<00:02:03.360> off

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
receiver in it and that's all sealed off

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.609 
receiver in it and that's all sealed off
completely<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:06.719> ESC<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.320> receiver

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
completely and the ESC and the receiver

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.859 
completely and the ESC and the receiver
are<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> roof<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.849> even<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.270> water<00:02:09.569> did

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
are up on the roof so even if water did

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
are up on the roof so even if water did
get<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.979> only<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> ESU<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
get in there the only way the ESU and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.059 
get in there the only way the ESU and
the<00:02:12.060> receiver<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.540> get

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
the receiver would get

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.380 
the receiver would get
that<00:02:13.159> is<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.519> did<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:13.849> roll<00:02:14.150> or

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
that is if it did like a roll or

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.949 
that is if it did like a roll or
something<00:02:15.310> but<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.510> only<00:02:17.659> part

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
something but so this is the only part

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.720 
something but so this is the only part
it<00:02:18.319> could<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:19.159> could<00:02:19.189> get<00:02:19.670> lit<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.459> oh

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it could it could get lit and then oh

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.179 
it could it could get lit and then oh
well<00:02:23.569> on<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.379> back<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:26.170> spin<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.319> around<00:02:27.439> I<00:02:27.920> see

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
well on the back we spin it around I see

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.690 
well on the back we spin it around I see
there's<00:02:28.849> where<00:02:29.299> i<00:02:30.219> glued<00:02:31.219> in<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> piece<00:02:31.670> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
there's where i glued in the piece to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.869 
there's where i glued in the piece to

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
seal it all up on the back here's the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.899 
seal it all up on the back here's the
ducks<00:02:35.480> fan<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:37.099> duck<00:02:37.790> did<00:02:38.329> fan<00:02:39.609> sonic<00:02:40.609> jet

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
ducks fan that duck did fan sonic jet

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.720 
ducks fan that duck did fan sonic jet
and<00:02:41.120> then<00:02:41.629> uh<00:02:42.099> that's<00:02:43.099> just<00:02:43.219> a<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:43.579> place

there the total weight is 20 ounces and
for<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.519> big<00:02:55.879> plane<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.359> this<00:02:56.569> that's<00:02:56.870> pretty

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
for a big plane like this that's pretty

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.979 
for a big plane like this that's pretty
light<00:02:59.349> this<00:03:00.349> plane<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.919> like<00:03:01.579> yeah<00:03:02.419> I<00:03:02.540> forgot

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
light this plane is like yeah I forgot

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.959 
light this plane is like yeah I forgot
how<00:03:03.109> much<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.349> one<00:03:03.680> was<00:03:03.829> but<00:03:04.250> anyways<00:03:04.819> I've

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
how much this one was but anyways I've

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:10.569 
how much this one was but anyways I've
got<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.299> air<00:03:05.689> truck<00:03:06.109> on<00:03:06.949> skis<00:03:07.519> uh<00:03:09.189> so<00:03:10.189> this

got this air truck on skis uh so this

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.479 
got this air truck on skis uh so this
one<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:11.030> pretty<00:03:11.269> light<00:03:11.569> for<00:03:11.810> such<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> big<00:03:12.489> bulky

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
one is pretty light for such a big bulky

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.030 
one is pretty light for such a big bulky
plane<00:03:13.790> so<00:03:14.480> I'll<00:03:14.659> fly<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:15.109> either<00:03:15.560> today<00:03:15.919> or

to fly that are I want to fly drive this

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.189 
to fly that are I want to fly drive this
plane<00:03:45.769> when<00:03:46.579> there's<00:03:46.759> like<00:03:46.939> a<00:03:47.299> lot<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:47.870> powder

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
plane when there's like a lot of powder

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.379 
plane when there's like a lot of powder
like<00:03:48.560> up<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.739> here<00:03:48.889> so<00:03:49.639> if<00:03:49.790> that'll<00:03:50.060> be<00:03:50.180> cool

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
like up to here so if that'll be cool
