00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
right thing but let's talk about what is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.939 
right thing but let's talk about what is
truly<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.149> build<00:01:00.660> 30<00:01:01.260> point<00:01:01.710> whatever

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
truly here the build 30 point whatever

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
truly here the build 30 point whatever
in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> i<00:01:02.489> will<00:01:02.820> back<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.329> save<00:01:03.600> public

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in the i will back up my save public

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
in the i will back up my save public
beta<00:01:04.500> branch<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.070> actually<00:01:05.489> almost<00:01:05.640> done<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
beta branch is actually almost done and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
beta branch is actually almost done and
with<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> being<00:01:06.900> almost<00:01:07.229> done<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.100> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
with it being almost done we're going to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.850 
with it being almost done we're going to
be<00:01:08.280> seeing<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.760> hit<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.210> full<00:01:10.110> public<00:01:10.590> release

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
be seeing it hit the full public release

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
be seeing it hit the full public release
sooner<00:01:11.760> rather<00:01:12.150> than<00:01:12.479> later<00:01:12.540> by<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.140> way

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sooner rather than later by the way

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.780 
sooner rather than later by the way
they're<00:01:13.530> talking<00:01:14.040> they're<00:01:14.070> talking<00:01:14.490> early

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they're talking they're talking early

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
they're talking they're talking early
within<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> new<00:01:15.780> year<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> my<00:01:16.500> guess<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.770> some

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
within the new year so my guess is some

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
within the new year so my guess is some
time<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> january<00:01:18.780> maybe<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
time with in january maybe even the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
time with in january maybe even the
first<00:01:19.590> week<00:01:19.860> or<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.280> january<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.540> see

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
first week or two of january we will see

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
first week or two of january we will see
build<00:01:22.049> 30<00:01:22.409> released<00:01:22.890> upon<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.369> masses<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
build 30 released upon the masses and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480 
build 30 released upon the masses and
then<00:01:24.270> obviously<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:25.020> few<00:01:25.470> polishing<00:01:26.070> builds

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
then obviously a few polishing builds

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.539 
then obviously a few polishing builds
between<00:01:27.060> 30<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.689> 31<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.159> full

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
between 30 and 31 and then full

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.530 
between 30 and 31 and then full
development<00:01:30.180> swing<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.140> begin<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.799> build<00:01:32.640> 31

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
development swing will begin on build 31

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
development swing will begin on build 31
which<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> great<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.530> built<00:01:34.829> 31<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> going

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
which is great because built 31 is going

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
which is great because built 31 is going
to<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.540> new<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> exciting<00:01:37.799> stuff

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to be a lot of new and exciting stuff

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.999 
to be a lot of new and exciting stuff
most<00:01:38.729> notably<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> stealth

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
most notably is going to be the stealth

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.800 
most notably is going to be the stealth
system<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.579> 31<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.240> actually<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> see

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
system in 31 we're actually going to see

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
system in 31 we're actually going to see
it<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.170> action<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.950> animations<00:01:44.610> at

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it in action with animations at

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730 
it in action with animations at
everything<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
everything and that's going to make the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
everything and that's going to make the
game<00:01:46.950> play<00:01:47.399> rather<00:01:47.909> differently<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
game play rather differently which is
