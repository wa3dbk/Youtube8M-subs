00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.140
 this is the image that is experienced at the moment in the mountain in the municipality 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.830
 We'll see 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.130
 up to eight cars have been dragged by a current that 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.449
 from the ravine 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.739
 which is located just opposite 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:17.470
 from a well-known area of ​​restaurants as is 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.169
 the monastery 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.710
 there is not much light and we can not see hardly anything but it is certain that the water goes down with 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.399
 there was brutality 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.309
 unbelievably just faced me with trapeze white car we see 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.949
 we have a great waterfall that can hardly be appreciated 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.630
 but that just a car that is completely destroyed 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 and to which the water passes completely above 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920
 I do not know how much Fernandez there are many millions of liters that are happening in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.740
 these moments 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.980
 how can you check 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.030
 the ground is completely 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.690
 take it all this we see 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.290
 he rolled this car completely 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.989
 standing and facing right is what we are seeing that river that goes down 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
 in this ravine that has become as I said 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.190
 improvised the neighbors all the world the astonished street before what is 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.160
 happening 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.690
 and is that nobody thought 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.450
 this temporary could 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 downloading so much water has been primed especially 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.690
 with the north of tenerife 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 and with that area and unfairly 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.770
 between the orotava and the realejos it is necessary to say that also port of the cross 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 is taking the worst part caixa the delegate pondered that they are having 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.340
 what to act 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.530
 and all this has been a matter of minutes a good matter of an hour 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.440
 and it was three o'clock in the afternoon when it started to rain 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 with great strength however it has been 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 barely an hour ago when it started to occur 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 this right now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.350
 we can almost see and say almost because 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.510
 the camera that I have is not too good 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.970
 but good at least 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.920
 of what is happening here this is just inside the ravine what 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.140
 what we see behind 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 a car to see if we can see the other 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.650
 with water with what is happening right now 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.420
 in the realejos
