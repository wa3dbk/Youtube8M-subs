computer here shortly and doing some

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.140 
computer here shortly and doing some
tests<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:01.960> see<00:01:02.109> how<00:01:02.859> it<00:01:03.039> does<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.760> if<00:01:03.850> I'm<00:01:04.030> able

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
tests to see how it does and if I'm able

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.749 
tests to see how it does and if I'm able
to<00:01:04.300> from<00:01:05.199> what<00:01:05.350> I'm<00:01:05.470> reading<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.979> should<00:01:06.610> be

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
to from what I'm reading it should be

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.039 
to from what I'm reading it should be
able<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.939> work<00:01:07.149> well<00:01:07.420> with<00:01:07.450> Windows<00:01:07.899> Media

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Center which my 80 I wonder does not and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.590 
Center which my 80 I wonder does not and
also<00:01:13.659> it<00:01:13.810> has<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:14.590> capturing<00:01:15.219> portion<00:01:16.090> here<00:01:16.329> so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
also it has a capturing portion here so

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.010 
also it has a capturing portion here so
that<00:01:16.990> should<00:01:17.320> work<00:01:17.530> with<00:01:17.710> pinnacle<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.810> again

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
did here in my computer

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.550
