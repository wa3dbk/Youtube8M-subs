00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
another thing I got rid of my prowlers

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.800 
another thing I got rid of my prowlers
that<00:03:14.250> I<00:03:14.280> had<00:03:14.490> with<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.120> they<00:03:15.420> had<00:03:15.510> attack

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that I had with the they had attack

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.199 
that I had with the they had attack
speed<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.140> movement<00:03:16.230> speed<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.850> that's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
speed of movement speed you know that's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.270 
speed of movement speed you know that's
I<00:03:18.570> do<00:03:18.959> miss<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.410> movement<00:03:19.740> speed<00:03:19.890> because

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
I do miss the movement speed because

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.210 
I do miss the movement speed because
it's<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.670> clutch<00:03:20.970> pretty<00:03:21.420> matter<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.010> you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
it's so clutch pretty matter but and you

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.199 
it's so clutch pretty matter but and you
know<00:03:23.310> what<00:03:23.430> that's<00:03:23.610> not<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.760> big<00:03:23.910> difference

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
know what that's not a big difference

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.290 
know what that's not a big difference
between<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.080> prowlers<00:03:26.060> dps<00:03:27.060> wise

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
between this and the prowlers dps wise

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.480 
between this and the prowlers dps wise
and<00:03:27.860> problems<00:03:28.860> are<00:03:28.950> probably<00:03:29.190> still<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.400> little

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
and problems are probably still a little

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.070 
and problems are probably still a little
better<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.390> know<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.540> bought<00:03:30.900> these

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
better but I you know I bought these

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.360 
better but I you know I bought these
cheap<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.530> sold<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.800> problems<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.250> more

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
cheap I sold the problems for more

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.449 
cheap I sold the problems for more
expensive<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:34.140> got<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> big<00:03:34.800> dexterity

like them both they're both good the one
thing<00:04:14.580> about<00:04:14.730> Quivers<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.180> notices<00:04:15.570> they<00:04:15.660> never

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
thing about Quivers I notices they never

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.170 
thing about Quivers I notices they never
change<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.350> attack<00:04:16.590> speed<00:04:16.919> either<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.880> quiver

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
change the attack speed either so quiver

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.920 
change the attack speed either so quiver
is<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.359> key<00:04:18.660> like<00:04:19.290> tons

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
is a key like tons

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.890 
is a key like tons
of<00:04:20.019> tons<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.739> attack<00:04:21.009> speed<00:04:21.250> on<00:04:21.370> them<00:04:21.549> um

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of tons of attack speed on them um

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.240 
of tons of attack speed on them um
that's<00:04:22.900> pretty<00:04:23.320> much<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.500> only<00:04:23.650> items<00:04:24.160> I
