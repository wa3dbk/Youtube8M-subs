00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.790
 edition of eris culinary heritage and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.040

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.370
 special people we have with others 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.080
 great colleagues together namely one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.079
 week for you to plan regional 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.869
 want to introduce specialties with us 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.160
 it is the mecklenburger rib roast 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.040
 which we want to do first today 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.290

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.180

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.739
 videos you can do that again 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 click or the whole 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.699
 playlist otherwise easy in the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.280
 infobox below always look there too 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.480
 Let's get in there so we would be together now 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 first our Mecklenburg 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.250
 rib roast without we have to on 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.140
 bone along a pocket pure 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 cut into the ribs piece 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.840
 he is, of course, both of 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 season well inside as well as from the outside 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 salt 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.710
 That's why it comes in the bag 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.710
 after that our filling is pure 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.500
 yes and here is traditional 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.010
 mecklenburg out of flames 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.200
 to bake one used now 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.670
 of course very sweet in the end 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.049
 and so apple on it as possible 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.049
 use sour apples 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.430
 so if we filled it properly 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.260
 to have 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.120
 then we have to do it all 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.740
 close our bag which we here 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.110
 we did that with us 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.170
 The toothpicks made it together 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.790
 while that afterwards consults with it 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.480
 the whole does not fill us there again 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.480
 comes out 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 yes, and then we just fry it 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.869
 have indeed used a casserole dish 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.159
 or pan depending on what 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.950
 fits in the represented simply by 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.450
 sharp on both sides 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.319
 a little bit of color war still exist 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.319
 sometimes the onions 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.840
 and film a little liquid 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:32.300
 on because the whole is now for about 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.100
 two hours in the oven at 180 degrees 19 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.010
 finished and then cut looks 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.450
 it then off and with one 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.910
 vegetable side dish I think so too 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.290
 Well 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.180
 as I said here again the note that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.520
 whole here is just one 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.430
 Cooperation with other channels 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.860
