00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
store is a bit pushing it though cuz he

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760 
store is a bit pushing it though cuz he
is<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.149> young<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:46.170> structurally

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
is very very young and not structurally

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.880

build<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.220> its<00:01:47.340> area<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.799> we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
build for its area but i think if we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
build for its area but i think if we
give<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.310> 20<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.119> possibly<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.079> start<00:01:52.140> if

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
give me 20 time possibly you start if

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
give me 20 time possibly you start if
it's<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.310> risk<00:01:53.490> starting<00:01:53.790> my

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's all you want some risk starting my

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's all you want some risk starting my
store<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:55.200> i<00:01:55.320> couldn't<00:01:55.560> stop<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.189> we

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
store well i couldn't stop it i think we

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
store well i couldn't stop it i think we
need<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> start<00:01:56.909> him<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.329> he's<00:01:57.479> getting<00:01:57.780> plenty

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
need to start him or he's getting plenty

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
need to start him or he's getting plenty
of<00:01:58.649> time<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.600> you're<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.899> about

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of time because you're not think about

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679 
of time because you're not think about
that's<00:02:01.229> always<00:02:01.560> issue<00:02:02.070> they're<00:02:02.820> fearful<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that's always issue they're fearful of

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.929 
that's always issue they're fearful of
starting<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.649> which<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.250> why<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.759> can't

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
starting you which is why they can't

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
starting you which is why they can't
grow<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.299> properly<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> fantastic

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
grow up properly now we do a fantastic

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
grow up properly now we do a fantastic
youth<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.940> imagine<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.479> good<00:02:09.660> maybe<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.080> we

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
youth but imagine how good maybe if we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.390 
youth but imagine how good maybe if we
started<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
started them on you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000 
started them on you
these<00:02:11.519> years<00:02:12.120> ago<00:02:12.390> only<00:02:12.900> discovered<00:02:13.409> them<00:02:13.530> now

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
these years ago only discovered them now

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.039 
these years ago only discovered them now
I'm<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.819> think<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.390> Dutch<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.840> Dutch

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
I'm just think about the Dutch the Dutch

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.979 
I'm just think about the Dutch the Dutch
the<00:02:16.470> nouns<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.730> fantastic<00:02:18.269> use<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the nouns they have a fantastic use and

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.569 
the nouns they have a fantastic use and
the<00:02:19.110> reason<00:02:19.379> for<00:02:19.409> that<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.129> way<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.430> they

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
the reason for that is the way that they

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.880 
the reason for that is the way that they
bring<00:02:20.819> up<00:02:21.060> their<00:02:21.269> players<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:22.140> start<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.650> the
