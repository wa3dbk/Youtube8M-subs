00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello, I am a month and today we are going to review 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 katy noir in its original edition or in its 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.590
 basic edition I was very very tempted to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 buy as the back to version 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.240
 school or something like that because it looked very 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 pretty but really , really, that's me 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 I am one of the people who prefer to have 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 the basic doll and in fact this was a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.170
 gift and good they bought it at coast 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.150
 rich and they gave it to me there was my 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.890
 gift day of kings gave me my 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 godmother that I adore with all my heart a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.829
 true greetings to all the people of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.200
 Costa Rica because they are the best as 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 caste pierce that check before 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.739
 they agree they remember how to review 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.739
 caster situ well parents 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.199
 now let's review this version 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.360
 which is the one that brings as the signature and all 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.309
 the special box and so in fact it's going to be 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.739
 pretty much the same thing that happened with caste 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.080
 first I'm going to keep the box and everything 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.880
 then this time it's going to be a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 bit like a frozen review because 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.530
 I'm just going to open it and I'm going to 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.880
 show i'm not going to take it 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.080
 like the little things he's 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.050
 tied up and like that because I like it a lot 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.940
 as it looks like that in the box and I would prefer 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.560
 That's how I'll keep it open for 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.380
 that we can see it in detail but 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.630
 allways it is going to stay in your box 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.630
 but well let's review the detail 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.020
 and it is here karim guard without box 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.970
 clogging us sorry if I have to 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.740
 To turn around, I have no vision 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.050
 of x- rays then I can not see to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.820
 through the cardboard has super hair 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.070
 super super long bone I think so 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.000
 only so what we have as the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.210
 tail would come almost as far down as the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 of pretty fillmore is a little bit 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.170
 messy then maybe I would take it out 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 and the cee would catch but I do not want to remove 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.800
 the one in the pose he's in then 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.770
 so we're going to leave it that's why I looked 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.080
 the one that looked better and good with 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.679
 respect to the face I love it like that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.109
 be as of this finish as mate 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.450
 and that because it contrasts super well with the 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:16.409
 makeup that is like super full of 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.340
 glitter and shine and so and good 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:22.060
 obviously the contrast with the lips 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.650
 super roses and I love how she is a 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.959
 black cat and cats are supposed to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.030
 blacks give bad luck all their subject is 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.530
 about bad luck, that's not why it's 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.620
 that has a number 13 on the ear of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.109
 here and that 's why continuing with his 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.409
 clothes her dress on top is 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.720
 as if it were a broken glass with a 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.370
 broken mirror because they know that the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.319
 broken glasses of bad luck the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.810
 number 13 is unlucky and 7 the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.250
 also has a 13 in pink on the part 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.829
 here is who turned tantito 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.359
 so you can see it well has this necklace 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.180
 that also in the part here is like 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.040
 Broken glass or broken mirror and in the part 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.680
 above if you can see it has a 13 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
 also like your journal has a 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.270
 big there were 13 there 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.099
 this type of fabric reminded me a lot 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.110
 when I was in elementary school and I was going to 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.180
 school festivals and my mom had me 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.800
 what to do as my locker room I feel that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.330
 they were like a fabric super thing I'm sorry 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.450
 that I had a wardrobe that was one 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.030
 fabric as identical is like pink with 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.250
 those brilliants following him from the dress 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.590
 has got this tail that is super super 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.360
 long or I've seen it I do not know if you want 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
 put a photo alfredo like that as 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.180
 go completely out of the box or 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.800
 as you see the tail that is very long but 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.230
 everything is as if it were as if 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.300
 been as torn by cat nails or 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.920
 that's why on how 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.690
 I do not know how to go down or anything else 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.760
 there cut to the random is like because 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.580
 she is a cat and probably likes it 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.980
 to scratch things then so is your 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.990
 dress and bring these drops that too 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.490
 of new and milan being broken mirror and the 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.030
 I really feel like it's a doll 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.220
 that has has very simple things but 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.290
 everything in it or both the color of the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.240
 skin the color of the hair the color of the 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.520
 dressed the silver that contrasts a 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.490
 good 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.890
 they make a little bit of it or they are 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.110
 few things but that is much at the same 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.120
 time mostly because the rose and the 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.530
 black are my favorite colors or be 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.020
 when I was in high school I did not go 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.420
 of pink and black and good talking about the 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.220
 base this doll comes with one of the 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.750
 special bases one of these bases that 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.510
 gives us to understand that this is a doll 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.770
 special because it is one of the bases that 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.810
 at the bottom it's like a 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.140
 skeleton of monster high and is of the type 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.490
 of base on which the doll does not 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.490
 hold of the waist but rather 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.190
 like the doll sits on it 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.720
 and then it 's like it's kind of 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.060
 of special base that lets us see better 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.410
 the dress and that makes it look more 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.270
 doll when we have it in the instant 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.919
 I 'm going to leave it like that anyway 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.590
 but if you want to get it out of the 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.690
 know that this stand looks great 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.979
 plus the doll any doll that 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.780
 put in this kind of are 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.569
 solved by that they put a stand 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.550
 special bracelets 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.580
 is I think the only thing that I do not super 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.159
 love this I feel that they are pink 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.689
 very dark that looks almost red then 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.789
 If they were of a pink clarito 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.429
 would have liked a little more this has 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.899
 like a chain and a bell because 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:26.249
 see that cats like 

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:27.899
 rattles of cats and jingle bells and 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.089
 on this side nothing else brings as bracelets 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:32.459
 with studs and so on the same rose 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.169
 that I do not love I think it's the 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:36.599
 only complaint that I would have of this doll 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.809
 that I do not love the shade of rose in the 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.520
 that are the accessories like the necklace 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:44.039
 is that I feel it is too dark 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.259
 but I do not know what you think is 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.200
 too dark in emotions heal 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.170
 I am a local media 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.060
 can be can be and this was all for 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.760
 the revision of karina I hope you have them 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.730
 liked is a doll that I love 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.410
 that is really all collector 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.140
 monster high should have this this 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.850
 doll because it is very nice the 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.980
 dress is amazing makeup is 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.180
 amazing the doll mold is very 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.650
 very pretty 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.330
 so I think it 's a doll that's worth 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.880
 It's really worth it to have it in your 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.590
 box as it is right now and quickly 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.960
