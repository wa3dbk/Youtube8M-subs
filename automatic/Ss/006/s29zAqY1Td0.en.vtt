let's get right into the first skin now
the<00:00:49.320> first<00:00:49.620> skin<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.100> video<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the first skin for this video is the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.110 
the first skin for this video is the
sg553<00:00:51.719> bulldozer<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.370> factor<00:00:53.730> new<00:00:53.850> price

sg553 bulldozer and the factor new price
for<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.449> $40<00:00:55.320> which<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
for this is $40 which i think is a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
for this is $40 which i think is a
little<00:00:56.250> low<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:56.730> sometimes<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.539> can

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
little low right now sometimes these can

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
little low right now sometimes these can
be<00:00:57.870> worth<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.260> $80<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.309> might<00:00:59.550> go<00:00:59.730> up

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
be worth like $80 and they might go up

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.779 
be worth like $80 and they might go up
after<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.870> operation<00:01:01.530> ends<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> minimal

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
after the operation ends but the minimal

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.950 
after the operation ends but the minimal
wear<00:01:02.969> price<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.750> conditions

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
wear price and all the other conditions

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.560 
wear price and all the other conditions
are<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.589> fifteen<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> ten<00:01:05.519> dollars<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.150> as

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
are like fifteen to ten dollars so as

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
are like fifteen to ten dollars so as
you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.750> see<00:01:06.810> factor<00:01:07.470> new<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> always<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> lot

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you can see factor new is always a lot

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
you can see factor new is always a lot
more<00:01:08.880> expensive<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> skin<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:09.990> it's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
more expensive for the skin because it's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.410 
more expensive for the skin because it's
so<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.680> rare<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> next

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
so much more rare to get now the next

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.750 
so much more rare to get now the next
skin<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> 5-7<00:01:13.350> nitro<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
skin is the 5-7 nitro as you can see a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
skin is the 5-7 nitro as you can see a
minimal<00:01:15.180> wear<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.540> only<00:01:15.720> sells<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.259> three

minimal wear one only sells for three

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
minimal wear one only sells for three
dollars<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.280> while<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> factory<00:01:18.360> new

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
dollars right now while the factory new

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.560 
dollars right now while the factory new
one<00:01:18.630> sells<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.220> $34<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.299> another

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
one sells for $34 so this is another

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
one sells for $34 so this is another
skin<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> lot<00:01:23.130> after<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
skin that might go up a lot after the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760 
skin that might go up a lot after the
operation<00:01:24.150> because<00:01:24.330> how<00:01:24.630> rare<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
operation because how rare it is and you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
operation because how rare it is and you
know<00:01:25.830> some<00:01:26.100> collectors<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.360> all<00:01:27.540> the

actually<00:01:58.140> cost<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.560> $250<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.820> p250<00:02:00.570> why

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually cost like $250 but p250 why

it's<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.079> little<00:02:01.259> cheaper<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.219> may<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:02.939> in

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it's a little cheaper but may go up in

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the same stats for the condition and it

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.459 
the same stats for the condition and it
is<00:02:40.120> actually<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.480> pink<00:02:40.840> hole<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.200> modern

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469

is actually a pink hole the modern

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419 
hunter is only a purple so I'm guessing

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.940

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
this is actually more rare but for some

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.099 
this is actually more rare but for some
reason<00:02:45.219> they<00:02:45.340> sell<00:02:45.579> for<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:46.090> good<00:02:46.659> amount<00:02:46.840> less

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
reason they sell for a good amount less

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.349 
reason they sell for a good amount less
than<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.319> m4a4<00:02:47.889> modern<00:02:48.370> hunter<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:49.239> it's

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
than the m4a4 modern hunter but it's

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.939 
than the m4a4 modern hunter but it's
still<00:02:49.540> an<00:02:49.659> insanely<00:02:49.959> rare<00:02:50.230> skin<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.799> the

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:50.949 
still an insanely rare skin and the

selling for $98 on the market it's
usually<00:03:06.040> pretty<00:03:06.459> expensive<00:03:06.549> there<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.599> still

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
usually pretty expensive there it still

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.270 
usually pretty expensive there it still
looks<00:03:08.109> really<00:03:08.169> beat-up<00:03:08.530> even<00:03:09.040> when<00:03:09.159> it's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
looks really beat-up even when it's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.640 
looks really beat-up even when it's
factory<00:03:09.639> new<00:03:09.819> but<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.840> skin<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.260> condition

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
factory new but this skin the condition

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.860 
factory new but this skin the condition
really<00:03:11.799> shows<00:03:12.099> on<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.909> the<00:03:13.269> minimal<00:03:13.689> wear

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
really shows on it and the minimal wear

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.009 
really shows on it and the minimal wear
one<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.319> only<00:03:14.769> 18<00:03:15.400> dollars<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.120> lot<00:03:16.720> cheaper

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
one is only 18 dollars so a lot cheaper

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.559 
one is only 18 dollars so a lot cheaper
than<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.439> factory<00:03:17.829> new<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:19.090> next<00:03:19.299> up<00:03:19.419> we<00:03:19.540> have

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
than the factory new but next up we have

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.780 
than the factory new but next up we have
the<00:03:19.720> mag-7<00:03:19.959> hazard<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:21.250> isn't<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.579> same

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
the mag-7 hazard this isn't the same

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.610 
the mag-7 hazard this isn't the same
collection<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.479> the<00:03:22.659> FAMAS<00:03:23.019> skin<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.379> showed

$62<00:03:26.680> well<00:03:26.919> be<00:03:27.069> minimal<00:03:27.400> burn<00:03:27.549> is<00:03:27.729> only<00:03:27.849> two

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
$62 well be minimal burn is only two

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.479 
$62 well be minimal burn is only two
dollars<00:03:28.659> and<00:03:28.959> 70<00:03:29.259> cents<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.709> I'm<00:03:29.799> guessing

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
dollars and 70 cents and I'm guessing

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.770 
dollars and 70 cents and I'm guessing
only<00:03:30.729> collectors<00:03:31.180> would<00:03:31.329> really<00:03:31.540> buy<00:03:31.720> this

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
only collectors would really buy this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.749 
only collectors would really buy this
because<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.259> does<00:03:32.829> look<00:03:33.009> kind<00:03:33.189> of<00:03:33.310> bad<00:03:33.459> since

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:33.759 
because it does look kind of bad since

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.189 
because it does look kind of bad since
it's<00:03:33.909> really<00:03:34.299> beat-up<00:03:34.540> even<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.049> its

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
it's really beat-up even when its

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.740 
it's really beat-up even when its
factory<00:03:35.590> new<00:03:35.769> but<00:03:36.699> I'm<00:03:36.819> guessing<00:03:37.090> collectors

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
factory new but I'm guessing collectors

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.659 
factory new but I'm guessing collectors
still<00:03:37.989> try<00:03:38.199> to<00:03:38.259> get<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.919> it's<00:03:39.069> very<00:03:39.159> rare

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
still try to get this and it's very rare

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.800 
still try to get this and it's very rare
so<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.509> factor<00:03:40.840> new<00:03:40.989> 162<00:03:41.709> dollars<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
so the factor new 162 dollars and the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.379 
so the factor new 162 dollars and the
final<00:03:44.139> skin<00:03:44.319> for<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.590> video<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.489> op<00:03:45.909> pink

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
final skin for this video is the op pink

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.589 
final skin for this video is the op pink

dollars<00:03:50.319> well<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.709> minimal<00:03:51.009> Wehrman<00:03:51.280> is<00:03:51.489> $21

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.209 
dollars well the minimal Wehrman is $21
and<00:03:52.689> of<00:03:53.290> course<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.650> is<00:03:53.799> in<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.009> same

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
and of course this is in the same

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.399 
and of course this is in the same
collection<00:03:54.430> as<00:03:54.849> the<00:03:55.030> masterpiece<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.290> can

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:56.409 
collection as the masterpiece and it can

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.020 
collection as the masterpiece and it can
be<00:03:56.500> used<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.799> trade<00:03:57.040> up<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.189> the<00:03:57.430> masterpiece

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
be used to trade up to the masterpiece

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.759 
be used to trade up to the masterpiece
but<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.689> probably<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.019> lot<00:03:59.169> more<00:03:59.349> efficient

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
but it's probably a lot more efficient

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.909 
but it's probably a lot more efficient
to<00:03:59.889> use<00:03:59.919> the<00:04:00.540> USPS<00:04:01.540> Road<00:04:01.989> Rash<00:04:02.229> skins<00:04:02.560> instead

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
to use the USPS Road Rash skins instead

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.740 
to use the USPS Road Rash skins instead
of<00:04:03.009> this<00:04:03.129> one<00:04:03.310> because<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:03.819> believe<00:04:04.359> that<00:04:04.389> one's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
of this one because I believe that one's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.809 
of this one because I believe that one's
a<00:04:04.900> good<00:04:05.019> amount<00:04:05.229> cheaper<00:04:05.799> now<00:04:06.340> if<00:04:06.609> you're

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
a good amount cheaper now if you're

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.309 
a good amount cheaper now if you're
wondering<00:04:07.209> why<00:04:07.359> these<00:04:07.569> skins<00:04:07.810> are<00:04:07.900> so<00:04:07.989> very

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
wondering why these skins are so very

I<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:10.090> be<00:04:10.239> explaining<00:04:10.659> it<00:04:10.870> again<00:04:11.289> in<00:04:11.439> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
I will be explaining it again in this

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.429 
I will be explaining it again in this
video<00:04:11.889> basically<00:04:12.849> every<00:04:13.329> skin<00:04:13.659> has<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> flow

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
video basically every skin has a flow

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:16.709 
video basically every skin has a flow
value<00:04:14.829> minimum<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.519> float<00:04:15.759> value<00:04:16.000> maximum

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:16.719 
value minimum and a float value maximum

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.689 
value minimum and a float value maximum
if<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.320> don't<00:04:17.500> know<00:04:17.620> what<00:04:17.739> float<00:04:17.979> value<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.459> it

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
if you don't know what float value is it

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.160 
if you don't know what float value is it
is<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.969> exact<00:04:19.419> decimal<00:04:20.019> that<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.529> determined

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
is the exact decimal that the determined

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.840 
is the exact decimal that the determined
the<00:04:21.320> amount<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.620> wear<00:04:21.770> on<00:04:21.800> your<00:04:21.980> skin<00:04:22.280> the

the amount of wear on your skin the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.730 
the amount of wear on your skin the

minimum<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.650> 0.06<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.760> skin<00:04:47.030> with<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.270> 0.06

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
minimum is 0.06 and a skin with a 0.06

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.260 
minimum is 0.06 and a skin with a 0.06
minimum<00:04:48.560> is<00:04:48.740> very<00:04:49.400> hard<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.730> get<00:04:49.850> factory-new

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
minimum is very hard to get factory-new

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.580 
minimum is very hard to get factory-new
because<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.780> order<00:04:50.900> for<00:04:51.170> him<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.440> be

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
because in order for him to be

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.060 
because in order for him to be
factory-new<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.580> has<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.880> have<00:04:53.000> less<00:04:53.570> than<00:04:53.720> a

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
factory-new it has to have less than a

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.570 
factory-new it has to have less than a
0.07<00:04:55.070> float<00:04:55.910> value<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:56.390> there's<00:04:56.570> less<00:04:56.810> than

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
0.07 float value so there's less than

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.240 
0.07 float value so there's less than
0.01<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.820> float<00:04:59.660> value<00:04:59.900> in<00:05:00.170> between<00:05:00.560> what<00:05:01.160> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
0.01 a float value in between what you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.950 
0.01 a float value in between what you
can<00:05:01.280> actually<00:05:01.550> get<00:05:01.880> factory-new<00:05:02.480> if<00:05:02.810> that

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
can actually get factory-new if that

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.440 
can actually get factory-new if that
makes<00:05:03.170> sense<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:03.530> basically<00:05:03.860> there's<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.880> one

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
makes sense so basically there's a one

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.470 
makes sense so basically there's a one
and<00:05:06.160> eight<00:05:07.160> each<00:05:07.400> ance<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.060> actually

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
and eight each ance of you actually

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.420 
and eight each ance of you actually
getting<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.930> factory-new<00:05:09.740> skin<00:05:10.130> when<00:05:10.310> this

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
getting a factory-new skin when this

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.550 
getting a factory-new skin when this
drops<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.270> believe<00:05:11.510> the<00:05:11.660> game<00:05:11.810> selects

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
drops because I believe the game selects

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.730 
drops because I believe the game selects
a<00:05:12.740> random<00:05:13.090> number<00:05:14.090> for<00:05:14.450> you<00:05:14.630> between<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.410> max

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
a random number for you between the max

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.370 
a random number for you between the max
float<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.400> min<00:05:16.580> float<00:05:16.930> I'm<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.080> sure<00:05:18.290> if

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
float and the min float I'm not sure if

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.140 
float and the min float I'm not sure if
I'm<00:05:18.470> explaining<00:05:18.710> this<00:05:18.860> too<00:05:19.100> well<00:05:19.310> but<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.760> hope

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
I'm explaining this too well but I hope

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.490 
I'm explaining this too well but I hope
that<00:05:20.330> kind<00:05:20.540> of<00:05:20.600> made<00:05:20.750> sense<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.200> guys<00:05:21.350> you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
that kind of made sense to you guys you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.050 
that kind of made sense to you guys you
can<00:05:21.620> ask<00:05:21.650> questions<00:05:22.250> in<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.460> comments<00:05:22.730> if

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
can ask questions in the comments if

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600 
can ask questions in the comments if
you're<00:05:23.630> still<00:05:23.900> confused<00:05:24.080> on<00:05:24.500> that<00:05:24.530> but<00:05:25.160> that's

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
you're still confused on that but that's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.040 
you're still confused on that but that's
just<00:05:25.700> about<00:05:25.850> it<00:05:25.970> for<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> video<00:05:26.360> guys<00:05:26.720> and<00:05:26.750> I'm

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
just about it for the video guys and I'm

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.040 
just about it for the video guys and I'm
expell<00:05:27.470> at<00:05:27.590> enema
