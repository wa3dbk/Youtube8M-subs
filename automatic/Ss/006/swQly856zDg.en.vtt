doesn't<00:01:14.399> look<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.789> towers<00:01:15.090> doing

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
doesn't look like my towers doing

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.300 
doesn't look like my towers doing
anything<00:01:15.750> looks<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.140> spirit<00:01:16.560> maged<00:01:16.740> killed

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.550 
anything looks like spirit maged killed
itself<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> maybe<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> trick<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
itself so maybe that's the trick to it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
itself so maybe that's the trick to it
spirit<00:01:22.560> mage<00:01:22.710> kills<00:01:23.070> itself<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> that's<00:01:24.150> how

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
spirit mage kills itself and that's how

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.200 
spirit mage kills itself and that's how
they<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.729> yeah<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.760> see<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
they can do that yeah I see that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
they can do that yeah I see that
and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:27.990> neat<00:01:28.170> trick<00:01:28.409> let's<00:01:28.920> watch<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> again

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

I just pretty much guarantee they take

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.880 
I just pretty much guarantee they take
out<00:02:20.970> one<00:02:21.180> corner<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:22.799> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
out one corner and then they go for the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.210 
out one corner and then they go for the
hero<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.459> they<00:02:23.819> come<00:02:24.660> here<00:02:24.690> eat<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.349> up<00:02:25.590> come

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
hero so they come here eat this up come

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.819 
hero so they come here eat this up come
on<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.849> think<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.930> destroyed<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.500> center

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
on in I think it destroyed in the center

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.850 
on in I think it destroyed in the center
herself<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.510> little<00:02:31.290> tweaking<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.829> I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
herself it's a little tweaking that I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.280 
herself it's a little tweaking that I
did<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.480> still<00:02:33.599> pretty<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.079> the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
did to it but it's still pretty much the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080 
did to it but it's still pretty much the
same<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.739> other<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.400> did<00:02:35.579> it<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.849> way

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
same as the other I just did it this way

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.720 
same as the other I just did it this way
so<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.390> sort<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.290> ends<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.769> little<00:02:37.980> faster

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
so it sort of ends it a little faster

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.490 
so it sort of ends it a little faster
instead<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.299> them<00:02:39.420> running<00:02:39.959> around<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.319> whole

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
instead of them running around the whole

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.220 
instead of them running around the whole
outside<00:02:40.829> going<00:02:41.670> around<00:02:42.000> round<00:02:42.540> round<00:02:42.690> round

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
outside going around round round round

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.920 
outside going around round round round
hm<00:02:44.069> whatever<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.450> want<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.690> show<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.870> guys
