many years I call it the distribution to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:33.700

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
make the distribution technique is one

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.860 
make the distribution technique is one
of<00:00:33.829> those<00:00:33.950> moves<00:00:34.310> like<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.790> clip<00:00:34.970> shift<00:00:35.239> in
