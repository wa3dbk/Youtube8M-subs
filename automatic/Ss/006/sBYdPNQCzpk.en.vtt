00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
sometimes they seem to do four sometimes

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.440 
sometimes they seem to do four sometimes
to<00:00:50.650> I<00:00:50.830> don't<00:00:51.400> know<00:00:51.550> what<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.760> rule<00:00:51.910> on<00:00:52.059> that<00:00:52.089> is

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.729 

but<00:00:55.450> also<00:00:55.930> from<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.350> start

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
but also from the start

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.100 
but also from the start
pac-man<00:00:57.700> plus<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.149> generally<00:00:58.510> harder<00:00:58.809> because

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
pac-man plus is generally harder because

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.410 
pac-man plus is generally harder because
right<00:00:59.379> from<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.649> start<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.760> power<00:01:00.969> pellets

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
right from the start the power pellets

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.249 
right from the start the power pellets
do<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.960> lot<00:01:02.410> less<00:01:02.680> time<00:01:02.920> than<00:01:03.219> things<00:01:03.520> do<00:01:04.259> I'm

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
do a lot less time than things do I'm

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.480 
do a lot less time than things do I'm
guessing<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.649> is<00:01:05.710> two<00:01:05.979> men<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.220> meat<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
guessing this is two men of meat the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.190 
guessing this is two men of meat the
fact<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.180> these<00:01:07.330> coca-cola<00:01:07.750> cans

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
fact that you have these coca-cola cans

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.320 
fact that you have these coca-cola cans
or<00:01:08.530> now<00:01:09.190> what<00:01:09.460> looks<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.759> be<00:01:09.850> some<00:01:09.940> sort<00:01:10.270> of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
or now what looks to be some sort of

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
or now what looks to be some sort of
alcoholic<00:01:10.930> drink<00:01:11.170> with<00:01:11.289> a<00:01:11.320> lemon<00:01:11.560> attached

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.700 

that<00:01:15.430> time<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.670> did<00:01:15.820> all<00:01:15.910> four<00:01:16.350> yeah<00:01:17.380> I<00:01:17.530> don't

that time I did all four yeah I don't

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.190 

it<00:02:11.090> looks<00:02:11.300> like<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.540> might<00:02:11.630> be<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> same<00:02:12.020> as

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it looks like it might be the same as

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.620 
it looks like it might be the same as
the<00:02:12.290> one<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.590> first<00:02:12.620> one<00:02:12.860> yep<00:02:13.490> oh<00:02:13.520> yeah<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:14.570> you

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
or terrified graphic is different to

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.760 
or terrified graphic is different to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
that's supposed to mean it doesn't

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.980 
that's supposed to mean it doesn't
really<00:02:27.470> make<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> difference<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:28.100> gameplay<00:02:28.990> and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
really make a difference on gameplay and

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.880 
really make a difference on gameplay and
see<00:02:30.110> that's<00:02:30.290> what's<00:02:30.440> mean<00:02:30.590> about<00:02:30.620> this
