you have a look at that you know it's
not<00:01:08.229> an<00:01:09.229> easy<00:01:09.289> base<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.159> take<00:01:10.340> down<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:10.759> quite

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
not an easy base to take down it's quite

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.870 
not an easy base to take down it's quite
messes<00:01:12.979> with<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.250> head<00:01:13.310> quite<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> lot

messes with your head quite a lot
actually<00:01:14.030> when<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.450> start<00:01:15.170> trying<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.469> break

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually when you start trying to break

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:16.990 
actually when you start trying to break
it<00:01:15.859> down<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.219> think<00:01:16.369> how<00:01:16.490> you're<00:01:16.670> going<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.850> do

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it down and think how you're going to do

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
it down and think how you're going to do
it<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:18.049> takes<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.469> lot<00:01:18.619> of<00:01:18.649> Vance<00:01:18.979> of

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
it and takes a lot of Vance of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.730 
it and takes a lot of Vance of
strategies<00:01:21.020> in<00:01:21.200> have<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.469> know<00:01:21.590> the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
strategies in have you know the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.649 
strategies in have you know the
off-centered<00:01:22.310> queen<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:23.090> try<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:23.390> forced

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
off-centered queen to try and forced

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.669 
off-centered queen to try and forced
hand<00:01:23.840> where<00:01:23.960> they<00:01:24.020> can't<00:01:24.229> take<00:01:24.409> an<00:01:24.560> air

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
hand where they can't take an air

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.840 
hand where they can't take an air
defense<00:01:24.979> down<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.679> yeah<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.549> think

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
defense down and and yeah and I think

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.450 
defense down and and yeah and I think
the<00:01:29.329> biggest<00:01:29.539> why<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:30.590> base<00:01:31.100> has<00:01:31.249> got<00:01:31.429> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the biggest why this base has got a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.330 
the biggest why this base has got a
floor<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.090> or<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:32.990> was<00:01:33.109> found<00:01:33.409> by<00:01:33.619> JC<00:01:33.950> let's

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
floor and or it was found by JC let's

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.679 
floor and or it was found by JC let's
put<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.579> that<00:01:34.609> way<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:34.969> he's<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.569> one

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
put it that way because he's the one

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.779 
put it that way because he's the one
that<00:01:35.840> cleaned<00:01:36.109> it<00:01:36.229> up<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:36.499> so<00:01:37.460> let's<00:01:37.609> watch

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
that cleaned it up and so let's watch

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.459 
that cleaned it up and so let's watch
Matt<00:01:37.999> attack<00:01:38.359> in<00:01:38.569> to<00:01:38.689> analyze<00:01:39.109> it<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.350> see

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
Matt attack in to analyze it and see

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.919 
Matt attack in to analyze it and see
what<00:01:39.649> he<00:01:39.770> did<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.009> where<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.189> went<00:01:40.310> wrong<00:01:40.429> and<00:01:40.929> I

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
what he did and where I went wrong and I

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.319 
what he did and where I went wrong and I
see<00:01:42.859> we<00:01:42.950> can<00:01:43.100> sort<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.549> pick<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.969> apart<00:01:44.060> a

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
see we can sort of pick it apart a

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.590 
see we can sort of pick it apart a
little<00:01:44.450> bit<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:45.640> mad<00:01:46.640> starts<00:01:47.090> out<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.359> red

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
little bit so mad starts out the red

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.870 
little bit so mad starts out the red
quite<00:01:47.899> nicely<00:01:48.170> with<00:01:48.590> two<00:01:48.799> loons<00:01:49.069> on<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.399> arch

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
quite nicely with two loons on the arch

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.599 
quite nicely with two loons on the arch
tower<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.869> single<00:01:51.409> loon<00:01:51.649> on<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.069> can<00:01:52.369> on

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609

the<00:01:52.819> mortar<00:01:53.569> and<00:01:53.749> which<00:01:54.439> were<00:01:54.560> nice<00:01:54.740> trades

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
the mortar and which were nice trades

just ran short the ride did and so from

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.920 
just ran short the ride did and so from
what<00:04:16.239> was<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:18.520> it's<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.120> decent<00:04:19.630> enough

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
what was you know it's a decent enough

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.440 
what was you know it's a decent enough
attempt<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.580> think<00:04:21.790> bit<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
attempt it just I don't think bit the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.000 
attempt it just I don't think bit the
amount<00:04:22.750> of<00:04:22.930> thought<00:04:23.230> that<00:04:23.500> went<00:04:23.650> into<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
amount of thought that went into the

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.370 
amount of thought that went into the
base<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.700> needed<00:04:25.540> to<00:04:25.570> be<00:04:25.690> applied<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
base and needed to be applied to the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.710 
base and needed to be applied to the
attack

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
attack

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.290 
attack
I know<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.710> mad<00:04:28.890> isn't<00:04:29.220> in<00:04:29.520> elite<00:04:29.910> normal

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
I know that mad isn't in elite normal

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.800 
I know that mad isn't in elite normal
roster<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:30.840> he<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.110> doesn't<00:04:31.470> have<00:04:32.220> that

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
roster so he just doesn't have that

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.580 
roster so he just doesn't have that
experience<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:34.260> war<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:35.510> to<00:04:36.510> really<00:04:36.690> stand<00:04:37.440> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
experience in war to to really stand a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.480 
experience in war to to really stand a
chance<00:04:37.620> against<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.220> base<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:40.370> so<00:04:41.370> what

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
chance against a base like this so what

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.890 
chance against a base like this so what
I'm<00:04:41.550> going<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.730> show<00:04:41.880> now<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.660> cleanup

that bit so like the start um exactly
the<00:05:08.310> same<00:05:08.430> start<00:05:08.700> actually<00:05:08.820> two<00:05:09.210> loons<00:05:09.450> on<00:05:09.720> the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870

why<00:05:12.570> does<00:05:12.780> differently<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:13.350> think<00:05:13.620> she<00:05:13.770> drops

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
why does differently I think she drops

why does differently I think she drops
an<00:05:14.370> extra<00:05:15.120> loon<00:05:15.360> on<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> mortar<00:05:16.440> down<00:05:16.680> the

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
an extra loon on the mortar down the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.040 
an extra loon on the mortar down the
bottom<00:05:17.130> right<00:05:17.400> you'll<00:05:18.150> see<00:05:18.240> there<00:05:18.630> look<00:05:18.660> and

bottom right you'll see there look and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.750 
bottom right you'll see there look and
that's<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.800> stop<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.160> which<00:05:20.340> is<00:05:20.520> getting

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
that's to stop it which is getting
