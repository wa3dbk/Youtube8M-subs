00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.200
 in the life of titeuf smallness of air gun prototypes of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.030
 tablets 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.209
 yes so here too we had the most fridge damage 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.469
 who tried to make me a pole videofutur 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.789
 and therefore only see the most charismatic 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.789
 by youtube 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.029
 the aisle and we will close it with a touch of Scotch like that and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 the other was under the penalty of the transfer knows that we will fuck 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.569
 a bouncing ball that is much smaller than 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.309
 more than a month for the handset is sealed it is necessary that the little pass 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.410
 in a way 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 we design first tests 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.410
 who then transcribed the tourists 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.600
 and not just clog here 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.050
 butcher once the money 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.300
 high speed between stables turn earlier 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 the candidate if so what will turn 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.140
 the second of nonsense 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.139
 if technically, let alone anyway 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.409
 quebec the ball in a corner a board that will try to cushion the shock even if 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.000
 I know woman is coming back to war and that's what's theirs 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.899
 so classify the three point 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 the sector suffers a breakthrough 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 the tenant who is the bank 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.229
 and beyond 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.700
 forty seconds roughly pumping 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.620
 48th why because it's really typical at the pump 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.860
 content with cons for those who do not understand more 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 s wait 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.880
 and therefore of loss 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 clothing 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.270
 why 6 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.480
 a thing 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.970
 so why not 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.950
 as an aside 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 whitacre 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.230
 it's clarity and purity is the part there 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.920
 washington judge failed to enchain on the sea 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 emergent 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.509
 younger age too good she is not very very fast but not bad when 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.509
 even the candidate does not say 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.940
 ankara - the title 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.019
 just a life that is still the complete departure 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.439
 it adheres air inevitably when when the pressure the players of the eire 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.479
 who spend a lot in front of the ball 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.409
 so you have faith it's not going to talk about ptct cooperate cullen before the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.349
 ball touched not perfect but precisely but% but against the eire 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.249
 who's going to be in front of the ball did not come in so it's not at all small 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:24.279
 malignant 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.099
 but what is called the board on the floor 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.979
 and Morocco in hundreds of places 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.989
 short week 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.049
 for memory 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.010
 here in this momentum the first test the total prototype course of but not 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.769
 less obvious 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.730
 here is a parent
