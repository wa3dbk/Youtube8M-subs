00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
asus transformer pad infinity so I

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.750 
asus transformer pad infinity so I
already<00:00:07.440> gave<00:00:07.649> you<00:00:07.710> guys<00:00:07.919> an<00:00:08.040> unboxing<00:00:08.340> as

already gave you guys an unboxing as

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.790 
already gave you guys an unboxing as
well<00:00:08.910> as<00:00:09.000> an<00:00:09.090> update<00:00:09.389> on<00:00:09.540> compatibility<00:00:10.380> with

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
well as an update on compatibility with

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.950 
well as an update on compatibility with
the<00:00:11.280> Prime<00:00:11.610> doc<00:00:11.880> which<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> really<00:00:12.840> good

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
the Prime doc which is a really good

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.410 
the Prime doc which is a really good
thing<00:00:13.019> because<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.920> Prime<00:00:14.190> doc<00:00:14.460> actually<00:00:15.240> has

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
thing because the Prime doc actually has

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
thing because the Prime doc actually has
a<00:00:15.450> larger<00:00:16.049> capacity<00:00:16.619> battery<00:00:16.980> than<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> dock

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
a larger capacity battery than the dock

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.630 
a larger capacity battery than the dock
that<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.570> marketed<00:00:19.050> directly<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.800> tf700

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
that is marketed directly for this tf700

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730 
that is marketed directly for this tf700
that<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.119> released<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:22.170> obvious

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that was just released now obvious

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.380 
that was just released now obvious
improvements<00:00:23.430> well<00:00:23.609> let's<00:00:23.970> start<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
improvements well let's start with the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.779 
improvements well let's start with the
screen<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.529> tell<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.769> guys<00:00:25.920> it's<00:00:26.279> really

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
screen I can tell you guys it's really

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
screen I can tell you guys it's really
good<00:00:26.970> definitely<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> best<00:00:28.170> I've<00:00:28.380> seen<00:00:28.410> on

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
good definitely the best I've seen on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
good definitely the best I've seen on
any<00:00:28.920> tablet<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> date<00:00:29.670> especially<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
any tablet to date especially the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.790 
any tablet to date especially the
brightness<00:00:30.779> level<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.349> you've<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
brightness level because you've got that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400 
brightness level because you've got that
super<00:00:32.160> IPS<00:00:32.309> plus<00:00:32.940> display<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:34.290> outdoors

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
super IPS plus display going outdoors

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
super IPS plus display going outdoors
with<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.980> isn't<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> problem

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
with this isn't going to be a problem

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
with this isn't going to be a problem
and<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.510> can't<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:36.899> say<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.530> any

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and I can't really say that for any

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.369 
and I can't really say that for any
other<00:00:37.980> tablet<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> market<00:00:38.780> even<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> iPad

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
other tablet on the market even the iPad

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
other tablet on the market even the iPad
so<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.460> area<00:00:41.640> where<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.000> even

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
so that's one area where this even

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
so that's one area where this even
outshines<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.960> iPad<00:00:43.739> you've<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.129> much

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
outshines the iPad you've got much

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
outshines the iPad you've got much
higher<00:00:44.700> brightness<00:00:44.940> level<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.780> just

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
higher brightness level here and just

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560 
higher brightness level here and just
the<00:00:46.739> overall<00:00:46.860> resolution<00:00:47.730> does<00:00:48.000> come<00:00:48.300> through

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
the overall resolution does come through

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
the overall resolution does come through
now<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.710> side<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.100> side<00:00:50.370> with

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
now if you put this side by side with

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.760 
now if you put this side by side with
the<00:00:51.270> transformer<00:00:51.840> prime<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.500> you'd<00:00:52.620> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the transformer prime I think you'd be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.939 
the transformer prime I think you'd be
hard-pressed<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.460> find<00:00:53.899> significant

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
hard-pressed to find significant

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
hard-pressed to find significant
differences<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.520> screen<00:00:56.760> quality<00:00:57.030> just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
differences in the screen quality just

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.869 
differences in the screen quality just
because<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.960> subtle<00:00:58.289> I'll<00:00:58.590> say<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
because it is subtle I'll say that and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
because it is subtle I'll say that and
brightness<00:01:00.329> levels<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> same<00:01:01.260> as<00:01:01.530> far<00:01:01.710> as

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
brightness levels are the same as far as

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.770 
brightness levels are the same as far as
build<00:01:02.070> quality<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.059> far<00:01:03.239> I've<00:01:03.329> noticed<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
build quality so far I've noticed that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780 
build quality so far I've noticed that
construction<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.159> similar<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
construction is very similar to the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.660 
construction is very similar to the
Prime<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:07.350> both<00:01:07.560> good<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.040> bad<00:01:08.100> good

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
Prime and that's both good and bad good

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.070 
Prime and that's both good and bad good
in<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:09.960> you're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
in that you know you know what you're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
in that you know you know what you're
getting<00:01:10.229> bad<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.430> quality<00:01:11.820> control

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
getting bad and that the quality control

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
getting bad and that the quality control
could<00:01:12.869> definitely<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:14.610> no

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
could definitely be better there's no

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
could definitely be better there's no
question<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.270> expected<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> sous<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.439> their

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
question I expected a sous to up their

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
question I expected a sous to up their
game<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.850> nexus<00:01:18.509> partner

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
game now that they are a nexus partner

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
game now that they are a nexus partner
with<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> nexus<00:01:19.409> 7<00:01:19.680> being<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.159> but

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
with the nexus 7 being out there but

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.630 
with the nexus 7 being out there but
unfortunately<00:01:21.439> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> couple<00:01:23.130> models<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
unfortunately in the couple models that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
unfortunately in the couple models that
I<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.900> certainly<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I got here there certainly was a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.859 
I got here there certainly was a
difference<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.790> terms<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> build<00:01:27.810> quality

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
difference in terms of build quality

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
difference in terms of build quality
some<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.680> creaking<00:01:29.070> around<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.520> edges<00:01:29.670> some

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
some are creaking around the edges some

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.999 
some are creaking around the edges some
aren't<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.049> overall<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:31.680> those<00:01:31.979> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
aren't but overall I think those are

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.039 
aren't but overall I think those are
issues<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> most<00:01:32.759> people<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
issues that most people are not going to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
issues that most people are not going to
pick<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:35.369> terms<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.909> actual<00:01:36.150> performance

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
pick up in terms of actual performance

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
pick up in terms of actual performance
it's<00:01:37.020> been<00:01:37.229> great<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:38.070> little<00:01:38.579> bit<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> lag<00:01:38.970> here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
it's been great a little bit of lag here

than obviously any hardware issues and I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.510 
than obviously any hardware issues and I
can<00:01:46.259> tell<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:46.829> I've

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
can tell you that because I've

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
can tell you that because I've
experienced<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> tablets<00:01:48.960> across<00:01:49.259> the

experienced all the tablets across the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.429 
experienced all the tablets across the
line<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:50.549> every<00:01:51.000> manufacturer<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> they

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
line from every manufacturer and they

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.630 
line from every manufacturer and they
all<00:01:52.590> perform<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.310> differently

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
all perform a little bit differently

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460 
all perform a little bit differently
obviously<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.259> slightly

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
obviously because they all have slightly

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
obviously because they all have slightly

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
everything the Prime should have been

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.920 
everything the Prime should have been
and<00:03:11.220> that's<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.670> say<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> prime<00:03:12.150> wasn't<00:03:12.900> a

and that's not to say the prime wasn't a

and that's not to say the prime wasn't a
fantastic<00:03:13.560> tablet<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.000> still<00:03:15.210> is<00:03:15.540> and

fantastic tablet it was and still is and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.020 
fantastic tablet it was and still is and
we'll<00:03:16.380> probably<00:03:16.710> find<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.370> an<00:03:17.550> even<00:03:17.760> bigger

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
have all kinds of bugs so so far I've

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.010 
have all kinds of bugs so so far I've
given<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.430> guys<00:05:01.610> basically<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.390> overly<00:05:02.900> at

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
least my experience of the build quality

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.540 
least my experience of the build quality
thus<00:05:05.120> far<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:06.050> I'm<00:05:06.620> pretty<00:05:06.830> impressed<00:05:07.040> with<00:05:07.400> it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
thus far so I'm pretty impressed with it

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.640 
thus far so I'm pretty impressed with it
it<00:05:07.700> is<00:05:07.820> built<00:05:08.150> well<00:05:08.360> overall<00:05:08.720> don't<00:05:09.230> take<00:05:09.440> any

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
it is built well overall don't take any

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.600 
it is built well overall don't take any
of<00:05:09.860> my<00:05:10.330> criticisms<00:05:11.330> as<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.740> know<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.860> miscue<00:05:13.430> to

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
of my criticisms as you know a miscue to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.970 
of my criticisms as you know a miscue to
tell<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.150> isn't<00:05:14.540> made<00:05:14.690> well

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
tell you that this isn't made well

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.290 
tell you that this isn't made well
certainly<00:05:15.980> there<00:05:16.190> will<00:05:16.370> be<00:05:16.640> an<00:05:16.730> audience<00:05:17.060> of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
certainly there will be an audience of

for example with something like the

overall build quality in terms of things

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.200 
overall build quality in terms of things
feeling<00:05:34.160> like<00:05:34.310> they're<00:05:34.490> coming<00:05:34.730> apart<00:05:34.970> you're

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
feeling like they're coming apart you're

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.850 
feeling like they're coming apart you're
not<00:05:35.360> going<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.810> find<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.470> that's

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
not going to find that and that's

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.320 
not going to find that and that's
something<00:05:37.070> where<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.340> sous<00:05:37.640> does<00:05:37.940> need<00:05:38.210> to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
something where a sous does need to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.360 
something where a sous does need to
improve<00:05:38.600> but<00:05:38.840> overall<00:05:39.080> really<00:05:39.380> like<00:05:40.070> what<00:05:40.250> I'm

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
improve but overall really like what I'm

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.060 
improve but overall really like what I'm
seeing<00:05:40.400> despite<00:05:41.090> that<00:05:41.300> critique<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.320> the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
seeing despite that critique and the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.070 
seeing despite that critique and the
screen<00:05:43.340> quality<00:05:43.580> is<00:05:43.880> great<00:05:44.060> definitely<00:05:44.990> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
screen quality is great definitely the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.409 
screen quality is great definitely the
best<00:05:45.230> in<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.410> business<00:05:45.620> right<00:05:45.919> now<00:05:45.950> but<00:05:46.790> you

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
best in the business right now but you

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.570 
best in the business right now but you
know<00:05:47.540> AMOLED<00:05:48.350> would<00:05:48.560> be<00:05:48.680> obviously<00:05:49.040> the<00:05:49.280> next

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
know AMOLED would be obviously the next

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.920 
know AMOLED would be obviously the next
step<00:05:49.820> I<00:05:49.970> don't<00:05:50.120> think<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.330> gets<00:05:50.360> much<00:05:50.630> better

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
step I don't think it gets much better

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.590 
step I don't think it gets much better
than<00:05:51.740> AMOLED<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:52.700> this<00:05:52.880> is<00:05:53.000> as<00:05:53.120> close<00:05:53.180> as<00:05:53.480> we're

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
than AMOLED so this is as close as we're

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.180 
than AMOLED so this is as close as we're
going<00:05:53.690> to<00:05:53.780> come<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.140> an<00:05:54.260> affordable<00:05:54.530> price<00:05:54.800> at

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
going to come at an affordable price at

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.950 
going to come at an affordable price at
least<00:05:55.340> for<00:05:55.490> the<00:05:55.550> time<00:05:55.580> being<00:05:55.960> processor

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
least for the time being processor

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.540 
least for the time being processor
performs<00:05:57.380> well<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.830> most<00:05:57.980> importantly<00:05:58.340> as<00:05:58.460> I

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550

mentioned<00:05:58.910> again<00:05:59.000> those<00:05:59.600> radios<00:06:00.080> are<00:06:00.350> just

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
mentioned again those radios are just

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.380 
mentioned again those radios are just

you<00:06:05.390> know<00:06:05.510> under<00:06:05.780> concrete<00:06:06.020> I'm<00:06:06.740> getting<00:06:07.130> GPS

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
you know under concrete I'm getting GPS

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.090 
you know under concrete I'm getting GPS
signals<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:08.480> no<00:06:09.110> comparison<00:06:09.710> of<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.860> Prime

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
signals so no comparison of the Prime

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.490 
signals so no comparison of the Prime
this<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.090> what<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.450> Prime<00:06:11.690> should<00:06:12.110> have<00:06:12.320> been

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
this is what the Prime should have been

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.010 
this is what the Prime should have been
again<00:06:13.460> these<00:06:13.580> are<00:06:13.640> only<00:06:13.820> really<00:06:14.570> initial

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
again these are only really initial

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.690 
again these are only really initial
impressions<00:06:15.530> need<00:06:15.770> to<00:06:15.860> spend<00:06:16.100> more<00:06:16.130> time<00:06:16.280> to

impressions need to spend more time to
give<00:06:16.820> you<00:06:16.880> guys<00:06:17.000> a<00:06:17.060> really<00:06:17.540> full<00:06:17.810> picture<00:06:18.080> but

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
give you guys a really full picture but

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.350 
give you guys a really full picture but
performance<00:06:19.130> looks<00:06:19.340> really<00:06:19.730> solid<00:06:19.910> and<00:06:20.240> those

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
performance looks really solid and those

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.690 
performance looks really solid and those

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
maybe the original transformer you're

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.290 
maybe the original transformer you're
going<00:06:24.919> to<00:06:24.980> be<00:06:25.070> really<00:06:25.460> happy<00:06:25.640> picking<00:06:26.030> this<00:06:26.120> up

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.180 
going to be really happy picking this up
the<00:06:26.540> Prime<00:06:26.840> I<00:06:27.169> still<00:06:27.710> have<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.890> spend<00:06:28.100> more

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
the Prime I still have to spend more

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.680 
the Prime I still have to spend more
time<00:06:28.250> to<00:06:28.640> really<00:06:28.820> tell<00:06:29.030> you<00:06:29.150> guys<00:06:29.300> whether<00:06:29.510> or
