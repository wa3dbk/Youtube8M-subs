00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.110
 the installation and a small review 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 a review of what the keyboard is 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.590
 microsoft all in one which already includes 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 because as you will realize the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.929
 touchpad which is the one that supports 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 gestures mouse is no longer necessary and all 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.970
 they have it here 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.490
 single device 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.050
 junior technician is going to be the installation 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.780
 then I invite you to come the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.150
 unpacked then if you install it for 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.420
 that people realize what it is 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.420
 the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.980
 the keyboard the keyboard is very 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.470
 interesting very nice 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.870
 has a lot of good things saving 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.170
 space 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.770
 is the most important thing really 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.770
 so 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 let's see how 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 this installation we are going to test in what 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.180
 what is windows 8.1 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.200
 The keyboard includes what is what it is 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.200
 a manual 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.940
 USB port goes what the connection does 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.940
 between the keyboard 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.610
 now 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.620
 this is the same as the Spaniards is 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.330
 hard 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.520
 let's see the Spaniards say 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.520
 computer we tell you the computer 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.990
 to see what 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.990
 what does it say 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.850
 the windows machine 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.190
 I believe that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.880
 the batteries you have to remove the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.880
 batteries 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430
 have a 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.280
 so here he was this morning 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.260
 actually 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.820
 the famous coubertin 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.519
 undoing 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.519
 on the map 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.750
 is working to prove the total that is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.989
 give account to put this with keyboard to 15 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.989
 and half 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 consider 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.569
 this can thrill in the normal pc or 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.579
 on a laptop 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.360
 when we are testing on a laptop it is 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.220
 of course for him 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.590
 Well what we have right now hand with 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.510
 windows 8.1 true is compatible from 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.510
 windows 7 to windows 8 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.670
 very comfortable modern nothing before seen here 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.560

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.940
