battle<00:02:19.650> turbine<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:21.860> it's<00:02:22.860> got<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.400> those

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
battle turbine and it's got one of those

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.830 
battle turbine and it's got one of those
symbols<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:25.549> let's<00:02:26.549> open<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.359> like<00:02:27.810> how

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
symbols and let's open it up I like how

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.540 
symbols and let's open it up I like how
this<00:02:28.049> one<00:02:28.230> opens<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.859> pretty<00:02:29.070> cool

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.260 

and<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.600> do<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.900> wrong<00:02:33.050> way<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.520> here<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.390> is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
and I do it the wrong way but here it is

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.780 
and I do it the wrong way but here it is
and<00:02:38.710> I<00:02:39.710> think<00:02:39.980> these<00:02:40.280> things<00:02:40.340> are<00:02:40.580> kind<00:02:40.760> of

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and I think these things are kind of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.180 
and I think these things are kind of
cool<00:02:40.940> diesel<00:02:41.240> like<00:02:41.420> pincer<00:02:41.840> things<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:45.590> looks

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
cool diesel like pincer things it looks

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.850 
cool diesel like pincer things it looks
pretty<00:02:46.430> similar<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.380> other<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:48.620> which

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
pretty similar to that other one which

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.760 
pretty similar to that other one which
is<00:02:48.890> called<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.020> bland<00:02:51.020> tour<00:02:51.320> gear<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.470> I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
is called the bland tour gear and but I

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.230 
is called the bland tour gear and but I
mean<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.250> one's<00:02:55.460> pretty<00:02:55.610> cool<00:02:55.850> looking<00:02:55.970> to

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
mean this one's pretty cool looking to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.800 
mean this one's pretty cool looking to
me<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.050> closing<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.620> up<00:02:58.450> you<00:02:59.450> have<00:02:59.600> these

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
me so closing it up you have these

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.160 
me so closing it up you have these
little<00:03:00.050> things<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.770> flat<00:03:01.430> those<00:03:01.760> little

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
little things that flat those little

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.800 
little things that flat those little
flaps<00:03:03.170> fold<00:03:03.440> back<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.460> guess<00:03:05.270> there's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
flaps fold back up but I guess there's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.900 
flaps fold back up but I guess there's
probably<00:03:05.930> an<00:03:06.440> easy<00:03:06.620> way<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:07.130> it<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.460> what<00:03:07.880> I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
probably an easy way to do it I what I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.420 
probably an easy way to do it I what I
found<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.570> easiest<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.020> far<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.770> get<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
found to be easiest so far is to get the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.020 
found to be easiest so far is to get the
full<00:03:10.610> diesel<00:03:10.880> flops<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.570> first<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.460> then<00:03:13.460> fold

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
full diesel flops in first and then fold

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.020 
full diesel flops in first and then fold
those<00:03:14.210> up<00:03:15.070> do<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.460> other<00:03:16.550> side<00:03:16.790> too

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
those up do that on the other side too

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.530 
those up do that on the other side too
and<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:18.410> fold<00:03:18.650> these<00:03:18.860> back<00:03:19.550> into<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.210> top

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and just fold these back into this top

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.740 
and just fold these back into this top
part<00:03:22.810> like<00:03:24.550> now<00:03:25.550> that<00:03:25.580> part<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.060> flips<00:03:26.540> back

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
part like now that part just flips back

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.630 
part like now that part just flips back
out<00:03:27.070> fix<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:29.110> ok<00:03:30.110> so<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.980> fold<00:03:31.220> those<00:03:31.370> back

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
out fix that ok so just fold those back

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.949 
out fix that ok so just fold those back
in<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.060> now<00:03:32.990> they're<00:03:33.380> not<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.070> actually

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
in and now they're not going to actually

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.100 
in and now they're not going to actually
stay<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:35.989> place<00:03:36.590> until<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:38.690> completely

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
stay in place until it's completely

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.670 
stay in place until it's completely
walked<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.060> have<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.480> hold<00:03:42.320> them<00:03:42.500> up

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
walked up so can I have to hold them up

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.510 
walked up so can I have to hold them up
in<00:03:42.920> there<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.470> then<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.739> found<00:03:46.280> it

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
in there like this and then I found it

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.510 
in there like this and then I found it
easiest<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.180> fold<00:03:47.840> these<00:03:48.020> back<00:03:48.320> next<00:03:48.850> because

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
easiest to fold these back next because

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.640 
easiest to fold these back next because
if<00:03:52.520> you<00:03:52.670> don't<00:03:53.000> do<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:54.050> lock<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.530> in

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
if you don't do that and you lock it in

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.710 
if you don't do that and you lock it in
like<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:54.860> first<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:55.820> fold<00:03:56.209> those<00:03:56.390> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
like that first and then fold those it

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.430 
like that first and then fold those it
seems<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.290> open<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.709> back<00:03:57.830> up<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:59.170> it's<00:04:00.170> easiest

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
seems to open it back up so it's easiest

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.900 
seems to open it back up so it's easiest
to<00:04:00.590> fold<00:04:00.950> those<00:04:01.070> before<00:04:01.459> you<00:04:01.580> close<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.910> so

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
to fold those before you close it and so

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.170 
to fold those before you close it and so
there's<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.810> here's<00:04:06.290> its<00:04:07.000> code<00:04:08.000> up

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
there's that and here's its code up

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.080 
there's that and here's its code up
there<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.989> let's<00:04:09.410> open<00:04:09.620> up<00:04:10.010> strike<00:04:10.820> flyer

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
there so let's open up strike flyer

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.440 
there so let's open up strike flyer
again<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:13.430> actually<00:04:13.640> equip<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.239> valve

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
again and to actually equip the valve

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.850 
again and to actually equip the valve
gear<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> have<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.020> kind<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.260> push<00:04:15.560> down<00:04:15.830> on

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
gear you have to kind of push down on

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.039 
gear you have to kind of push down on
these<00:04:16.250> to<00:04:16.970> make<00:04:17.090> sure<00:04:17.239> they're<00:04:17.390> flat<00:04:17.750> or

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
these to make sure they're flat or

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.440 
these to make sure they're flat or
otherwise<00:04:18.350> they<00:04:18.560> get<00:04:18.709> in<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.950> way<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:20.090> open

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
otherwise they get in the way so open

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.080 
otherwise they get in the way so open
this<00:04:20.570> back<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:21.490> throughout<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.640> mention<00:04:22.940> too

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
this back up throughout the mention too

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.040 
this back up throughout the mention too
that<00:04:23.120> up<00:04:23.600> top<00:04:23.960> here<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:25.180> 70<00:04:26.180> g<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:29.000> get<00:04:29.780> again

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
that up top here is a 70 g so get again

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.990 
that up top here is a 70 g so get again
they<00:04:30.380> strike<00:04:30.919> flower<00:04:31.160> has<00:04:31.370> those<00:04:31.580> little<00:04:31.790> pegs

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
they strike flower has those little pegs

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.620 
they strike flower has those little pegs
just<00:04:32.870> match<00:04:33.080> them<00:04:33.260> up<00:04:33.380> with<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.650> holes

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
just match them up with the holes

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.160 
just match them up with the holes
and<00:04:36.080> there<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.100> go<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:38.360> that's<00:04:38.570> strike<00:04:38.900> flyer

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
and there you go so that's strike flyer

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.380 
and there you go so that's strike flyer
with<00:04:39.470> his<00:04:39.650> battle<00:04:40.010> gear<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:43.030> cards<00:04:44.030> that<00:04:44.210> came

blast baka boost pack if not then I

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.200

gonna<00:06:27.970> be<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.120> same<00:06:28.360> length<00:06:28.660> but<00:06:28.870> this<00:06:29.560> is

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
gonna be the same length but this is

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.830 
gonna be the same length but this is
