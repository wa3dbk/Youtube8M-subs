this tsuki in here there's a little
acupoint

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
acupoint

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.219 
acupoint
acupressure<00:04:27.270> point<00:04:27.629> there<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:27.960> as<00:04:28.080> you

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
acupressure point there and as you

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.010 
acupressure point there and as you
squeeze<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:28.830> makes<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> calf<00:04:29.550> go<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.870> this
