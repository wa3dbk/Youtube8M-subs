00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.350
 the opening has already betrayed it 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.170
 Today I'll show you street fighter 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.930
 comics yes that also appeared in 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.410
 Germany better said that is the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.590
 first manga series to do this 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.950
 Street Fighter was released after that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.050
 some comics in mali buchverlag 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.410
 and later also in the publishing house 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 only these are the only issues 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.379
 better said the German 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.550
 have been translated 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.010
 the whole is from the mangaka author macao 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.530
 micanski so now I have the hamburg 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 finally pronounced properly and 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.179
 the whole thing was bettered out 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.219
 the whole thing has appeared in the bastei 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:02.629
 verlag these four books is one 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:06.170
 completed story appeared in 1994 and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.190
 each have 80 pages with the first one 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.270
 folder only has 76 pages but with 80 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.950
 Yes, the drawings are advertised 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.860
 are very good for the time 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.930
 So what does that mean then for that well then 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.550
 What you get offered in Germany 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.100
 has mangas in the matter so it is yes 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:37.060
 Of course not the usual manga format 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.060
 because they were not like that at the time 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.480
 courted so the manga format was still 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.880
 not so courted about that one has 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.370
 so probably decided that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 the whole thing in the format rausbringt 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.000
 and yes, what I wanted to say 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 the drawings of mrs can sacchi 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.480
 are very nice to look at so I think 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.110
 really good 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.600
 everyone who has mangas left or 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.430
 Generally for street fighter will open 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.370
 Everybody really likes this one 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.099
 find something that is not so nice 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.650
 are partly the translations 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.170
 because you really notice then on the basis of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.569
 translations 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.780
 there you have a bit free the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.670
 taken and yes here 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 then always at the staples the characters 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 explained below that was certainly so 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.280
 in the manga volumes but so what I 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.220
 can not summon now 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.950
 and well, what else a small drawback 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.810
 is at the staples just this very much 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.090
 linear straight lines in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.940
 the speech bubbles but well, it was good 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.400
 the bastei verlag yes I have known 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.310
 already other comics from the time 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.019
 read by the bastei publisher and that's it 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.120
 was always like that with the speech bubbles 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.910
 You can do that in part as if they were 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 then inserted with Schalk machine 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.560
 had 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.690
 and yes, of course, is on every folder 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:15.230
 that capcom logo on it and yes story 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:18.140
 moderately the normal becomes the story of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.370
 the original street fighter 2 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.660
 So series tells the normal 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.260
 original street fighter 2 game 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.120
 without these extra fighters you can 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.250
 attached to the story 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.590
 and yes, you also had two 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.269
 additional characters of the story inserted so 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.450
 that you can do it all a bit 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.489
 entertaining packed and yes so 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.370
 we can already see that 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.680
 drawings are really awesome like me 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.420
 find 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.730
 and well, that's a bit silly 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.750
 the colorings yes okay that likes now 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.190
 maybe everything seems very nice though 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.049
 You definitely notice that one 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.180
 the whole postcolored because 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.859
 originally mangas are black and white 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.920
 and more komik reader falls something 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:10.280
 of course, but so the cover artwork 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.950
 are pretty chic for German issues 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.840
 I have to say that there is nothing there 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.010
 Of course , then others were 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.329
 things from the bastei publisher advertised well 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.580
 Let's leave that with the comics 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.550
 let's get back to street fighter 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.949
 comic 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:32.789
 So it's really great here too 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:36.840
 double-sided scenes yes as I said the 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:38.370
 Colorings are rather mediocre 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.280
 we do not want to be so strict now 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.900
 his and yes the anger is the original one 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.599
 Speech bubbles how to let it go 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:52.620
 they were doing very well and 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:54.330
 actually an optimal optimization 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.759
 his street fighter collection or 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.039
 Generally if you are on langers and humor 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.500
 yes and here in the last issue 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.810
 did you have such a special one? 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.169
 then movies jean claude van 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.169
 damme 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.460
 yes, that would already be everything 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.560
 what I could say about these staples 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.810
 In total, there were four editions and 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.810
 appeared in the bastei publishing house 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.889
 I hope you could with this video 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.710
 what to do 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.169
 I say thanks for turning on and oh 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.389
 yes, if you like the streetfighter history 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.830
 I am very interested in you now 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:37.729
 here somewhere a video turn 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.409
 I link to a left but link from 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.930
 business review so right one time 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.880
 awesome video for the street fighter 2 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.610
 History and you should do that 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.849
 you absolutely have to look 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.719
 So who does not become street fighter 2? 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.479
 History summer to street fighter 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.669
 In general, that's how it was 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.300
 I say thanks for turning on until 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.719
 next time 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.719
 new quieter
