00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.230
 thermaltake play even easier 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.050
 why 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.519
 why 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:41.500
 Hello everyone, I am a different techno-kitchen 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:44.440
 first in russia the company itself is new 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.750
 baby in the good sense of the word so 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.899
 and the cooler is very unusual futuristic 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.170
 there is no such thing and it was not pleasing to the eye and 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.640
 decorate almost any system 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.949
 interesting approach big solid 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.750
 radiator, instead of the usual plates 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.750
 ribs with a structure resembling 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.789
 bee honeycomb running ahead we note that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.560
 you are more a design celebration than 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.470
 revolutionary development allowing 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.630
 more efficiently remove heat controversial 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.110
 that we only have 4 nickel-plated 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 tubes with a diameter of 6 millimeters 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.789
 let's say so modestly heat transport plus 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.450
 to this thin 14 centimeter 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.800
 the fan is thin and noisy by the way 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.950
 the developer assures that no more than 24 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 decibel per meter fan really 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.119
 noisy at its maximum 1300 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.799
 rpm 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.960
 absolutely all sockets are supported 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.539
 There is a thermopaste syringe for companies 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.310
 and a penless screwdriver classic for 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.560
 super cooler system with backplate 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.569
 convenient that for the final installation is not 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.750
 you need to remove the fan enough 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.819
 use holes 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.649
 height is 16 centimeters which means 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.190
 wide compatibility with all ltx 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.429
 corps weight small rather big 628 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.110
 grams fan is actually thin 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.700
 because the developer wanted to do 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.869
 super cooler that allows 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.860
 set high memory 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.550
 radiators 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.340
 yes it is beautiful though useless key 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.470
 the fact that the price is a miracle of only 47 dollars 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.459
 two times less than usually costs super 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.230
 cooler, such a lite version of the cooler 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.860
 to tests 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 we warm up the fx 8350 processor 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.130
 overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz with 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.980
 1.35 volts 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.750
 severe el-es-es-te test for 15 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.530
 minutes and that in the end 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.090
 57 degrees is a normal result. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.800
 but for normal passing tests 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.400
 we had to install full 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.750
 thickness of the fan for what were staples 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.850
 would install and the second one is the same 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.040
 thin but complete with staples only for 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.690
 one fine model full super 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.730
 cooler from thermaltake as you see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.580
 cope with the task the best truth and 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.980
 worth more in our opinion is quite good 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.200
 cooler for your money for appearance give 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.220
 they had a silver award and with you was dina 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 to new meetings
