if we take a closer look at the leaves
of<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> rhubarb<00:04:11.640> we<00:04:12.640> see<00:04:12.909> in<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.209> cells<00:04:13.480> that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
of the rhubarb we see in the cells that

of the rhubarb we see in the cells that
the<00:04:14.349> starch<00:04:14.650> grains<00:04:14.980> are<00:04:15.220> few<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:15.760> far

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the starch grains are few and far

the starch grains are few and far
between<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.979> is<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> sure<00:04:18.549> sign<00:04:18.579> that<00:04:19.209> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
between this is a sure sign that the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.930 
between this is a sure sign that the
plant<00:04:19.959> has<00:04:20.109> been<00:04:20.229> unable<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.919> manufacture<00:04:21.790> its

sugary<00:04:22.300> food<00:04:26.250> outside<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:28.419> rhubarb<00:04:28.900> is

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
sugary food outside the rhubarb is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.460 
sugary food outside the rhubarb is
gorging<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:30.010> sunlight<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.760> has<00:04:31.570> grown<00:04:31.780> fat<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
gorging on sunlight it has grown fat and

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
gorging on sunlight it has grown fat and
full<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.040> starch<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:35.080> stems<00:04:35.470> are<00:04:35.770> tough<00:04:36.220> and

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
full of starch the stems are tough and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.469 
full of starch the stems are tough and
inedible

so<00:04:38.229> it's<00:04:38.380> only<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.860> pots<00:04:39.130> that<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:40.030> stems

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
so it's only in the pots that the stems

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.629 
so it's only in the pots that the stems
deprived<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:41.199> sunlight<00:04:41.560> are<00:04:41.800> tender<00:04:42.520> enough

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
deprived of sunlight are tender enough

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.120 
deprived of sunlight are tender enough
to<00:04:42.970> eat
