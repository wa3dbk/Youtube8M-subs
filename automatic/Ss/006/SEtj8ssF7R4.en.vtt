 the king and often ask me spain 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.930

 buy olive oil is better 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.990
 choose because olive oil 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.980
 here, as you can see, huge-huge 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.489
 set but store to the top and oil 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:44.059
 olive just thats all 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:48.489
 olive oil of different capacities 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.239
 volume different prices 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:56.980
 luxury oils special offer 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:00.910
 bitter rich light 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.030
 a lot of different olive oil and 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.790
 really 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.260
 to sort it out with overclocking not 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.570
 just and the season will give some ordinary 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.760
 Tips for the most unpretentious not to 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.520
 bother if you can mash 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.400
 marked here with a label like this 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.400
 Often butter made precisely in Catalonia 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.510
 if you do not buy oil as a gift and 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
 it doesn't matter to you to buy something 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.980
 small some small beautiful 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
 bottle 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.930
 it is better to buy oil in big 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.020
 bottle though you show just 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.460
 beautiful bottles are less visible 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.460
 they are glass 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.020
 do not buy for a gift and buy 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.360
 currently loved 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.950
 it is better to buy all the same plastic 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.700
 because firstly the plane you not 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.849
 will let 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.200
 Here, for example, this is a good butter 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:17.019
 enough the plane won't let you in with 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.780
 hand luggage and butter and there 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.150
 pack it in an opera suitcase 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.879
 glass packaging weighs more you already 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.549
 you can pay for the advantage 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:31.360
 typing a whole lot of a 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.549
 secondly it beats the same bottle 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.160
 just need a good roll up the letters on 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.590
 plastic so here i like it 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.720
 I like this oil very much 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.819
 plastic bottle and immediately another 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.959
 glass option 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:56.379
 If then immediately weight so the most good 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:03:01.170
 Catalonia oil is an oil of axes taver hin 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.700

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.859

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.859
 also again do not bother undead 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.569
 you can buy it specially just sitting 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.810

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:16.260
 extra this is how it is spelled up and on 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.260
 extra 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.800
 so what about the mara which is sold everywhere 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 which are pretty good in my opinion 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.650
 this brand nikken extra see it 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.160
 wool Darkin axes Divergent costs 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.460
 harry kino cursor that's good very 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.470
 oil I'm not talking about super elite 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.930
 varieties that made on small 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.010
 some hi in the famous from the house reiki 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.770
 100 Greeks and the oil that is generally 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.950
 factory production 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:02.310
 legs good analyst as it is for 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.540
 curator body clients vampire so here it is 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.689
 hubble master 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.689
 So 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.719
 blind but he is a game 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.710
 my friend store is all 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.040
 until prices are somewhere mercadona it's like 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.350
 choose the right olive oil it 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.860
 should be dark enough darker 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.750
 so delicious lighting 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.050
 In addition, olive oil is generally 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.810
 not stored for long if it is stored for a year 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.440
 maximum but not more than it should be stored in 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.690
 dark place inaccessible to light 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.540
 by the way here is this false gorges 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.630
 famous butter it is sold everywhere 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.440
 good enough is saturated then 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.200
 there is she is not a branch and there is 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.490
 lighter it is worse already besides if you 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.680
 put at home 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.610
 leave the refrigerator with butter or 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.790
 freezer real butter must 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.760
 precipitate or even a little bit 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:21.310
 freeze if it doesn't freeze but it 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:25.780
 mean it's not real perry oil 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:29.969

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.629
