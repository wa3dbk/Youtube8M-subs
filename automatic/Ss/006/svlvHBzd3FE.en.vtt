00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.630
 all the good time of the day my name is Artem 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.830
 and today I would like to show you 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.830
 in view of the card company nvidia geforce 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.570
 gt630 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.279
 so let's start and let's start with the fact that 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.970
 consider what comes with this 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.430
 video card 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.220
 The bundle comes directly with 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.570
 drivers 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.760
 installation guide book 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.430
 Well, the video card itself cleans up all unnecessary and 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.940
 again I will say what it represents 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.350
 of yourself this video card and so 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.049
 directly that regards itself 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.600
 video card on the video card has a connector 

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:54.110
 hdmi standard enemy and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.540
 Divey cooled visa card data and 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.159
 engaged in satisfied small radiator and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.019
 cooler made by special 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.979
 technology to stepan I mean this 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.549
 cooler 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.790
 it is made so that the dust does not fall into itself 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.430
 the mechanism that is to say it does not arise 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.950
 rotational difficulty and as a result 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.570
 less noise and other trouble on 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.670
 data card installed 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.230
 new generation capacitors with solid 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.180
 fillers and according to 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.600
 producer it boosts 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.880
 videocard up to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.690
 50,000 hours 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.630
 video card connects to computer 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.490
 more precisely to the motherboard through 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.890
 Express food connector double set 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.510
 hard on the video card installed in studying 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 nvidia geforce gt630 series 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.540
 with a frequency of 800 10 megahertz and with 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.900
 overclocking capability up to 1620 megahertz 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:01.549
 there is also installed a memory of 2 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.940
 gigabyte sel ddr3 with a frequency of 1820 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.190
 megahertz and so i would say 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.349
 completion is a good budget choice 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.080
 since this video card is quiet 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.430
 copes with many modern 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.940
 tasks such as playback 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.570
 1080p video 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.850
 and as a result, she copes well with 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.940
 many games allow the same 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.880
 battlefield 3 on medium parameters 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:33.420
 more precisely setting in my fps sags 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.940
 from 45 to 30 or 20 in this area how to 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.550
 example , the side will be abstract and here 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 will be exposed to the game that took place 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.810
 new who played on this video card 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.720
 with an extract and FPS about and 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.550
 and the other parameters of my say so 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.080
 computer is this issue 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.080
 Arsik was with you all good luck
