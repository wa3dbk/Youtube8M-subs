00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
but we'll see what magic happens when I

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:57.130 
but we'll see what magic happens when I
apply<00:03:48.829> my<00:03:49.829> mascara

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
I'm not liking it so far honestly I'm

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.640 
I'm not liking it so far honestly I'm
not<00:04:22.210> liking<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.600> my<00:04:22.900> eyelashes<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.530> look

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
not liking it my eyelashes just look

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:33.120 
not liking it my eyelashes just look
lumpy<00:04:23.830> they<00:04:24.790> don't<00:04:24.940> look<00:04:25.030> nice<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.890> says<00:04:33.100> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
lumpy they don't look nice so it says to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.770 
lumpy they don't look nice so it says to
repeat<00:04:33.700> steps<00:04:34.000> two<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.360> three<00:04:34.450> for

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
repeat steps two and three for

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.290 
repeat steps two and three for
life-changing<00:04:35.380> lashes<00:04:35.950> doing<00:04:36.940> them<00:04:37.060> just

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
life-changing lashes doing them just

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.720 
life-changing lashes doing them just
once<00:04:37.540> wasn't<00:04:38.170> very<00:04:38.710> life-changing<00:04:38.980> for<00:04:39.430> me<00:04:39.550> so

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
once wasn't very life-changing for me so

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.850 
once wasn't very life-changing for me so
I'm<00:04:39.820> gonna<00:04:39.970> go<00:04:40.060> ahead<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.600> do<00:04:40.840> steps<00:04:41.590> two<00:04:41.740> and

I'm gonna go ahead and do steps two and
three<00:04:41.920> again<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.430> see<00:04:42.640> if<00:04:42.670> my<00:04:43.060> lashes<00:04:43.560> become

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
three again and see if my lashes become

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.870 
three again and see if my lashes become
life-changing<00:04:45.220> um<00:04:45.990> all<00:04:46.990> right<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.410> here<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
life-changing um all right so here is

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.630

one<00:04:48.880> eye<00:04:48.910> with<00:04:49.830> two<00:04:50.830> coats<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.370> lash

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
one eye with two coats of the lash

one eye with two coats of the lash
extension<00:04:51.820> mascara<00:04:52.420> with<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.290> extensions<00:04:53.830> on

mascara<00:04:56.920> on<00:04:57.130> but<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.910> mean<00:05:00.750> like<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.930> don't<00:05:02.170> think

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
mascara on but I mean like I don't think

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260 
mascara on but I mean like I don't think
it<00:05:02.380> does<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.590> better<00:05:02.860> job<00:05:02.980> than<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.910> regular

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
it does a better job than like a regular

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.910 
it does a better job than like a regular
mascara<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.900> usually<00:05:05.200> use<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.440> rocket<00:05:05.770> mascara
