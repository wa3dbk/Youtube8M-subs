it's turned up upside down and you can

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.830 
it's turned up upside down and you can
tell<00:00:08.730> who<00:00:08.940> perhaps<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.389> calling<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.750> if

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
tell who perhaps is calling you if

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.049 
tell who perhaps is calling you if
they're<00:00:09.990> one<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.139> your<00:00:10.380> key<00:00:10.889> five<00:00:11.219> people<00:00:11.759> key

functional part of the three sided but
let's<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.660> grips<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> what<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.590> manis

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
let's get to grips of what this is manis

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.790 
let's get to grips of what this is manis
these<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.359> two<00:00:21.750> new<00:00:22.170> phones<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
these are not one but two new phones to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.939 
these are not one but two new phones to

the galaxy range sin s6 and the s6 edge

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.160 
the galaxy range sin s6 and the s6 edge
is<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> say<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.849> curved<00:00:27.300> screen<00:00:27.840> er<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
is is say with that curved screen er a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.890 
is is say with that curved screen er a
three-way<00:00:29.070> screen<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> let's<00:00:30.359> look<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:30.599> style

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
three-way screen and let's look at style

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900 
three-way screen and let's look at style
for<00:00:31.230> style<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.740> substance<00:00:32.009> let's<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.550> style

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
for style and substance let's go style

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.160 
for style and substance let's go style
because<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.570> everyone's<00:00:34.079> talking

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
because this is what everyone's talking

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.880 
because this is what everyone's talking
about<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:35.280> beautiful<00:00:35.760> metal<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> glass

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
about it's beautiful metal and glass

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
about it's beautiful metal and glass
much<00:00:37.890> stronger<00:00:38.340> glass<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:38.879> easier<00:00:39.300> but

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
much stronger glass so it's easier but

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.569 
much stronger glass so it's easier but
less<00:00:39.989> easy<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.379> break<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> shatter<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
less easy to break it to shatter it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.459 
less easy to break it to shatter it
overall<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.570> comes<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.170> array<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
overall and it comes in an array of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
overall and it comes in an array of
colors<00:00:43.860> my<00:00:43.980> personal<00:00:44.399> favorite<00:00:44.760> gold

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
colors my personal favorite gold

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
colors my personal favorite gold
obviously<00:00:45.719> but<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.140> black<00:00:46.620> white<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
obviously but there's black white and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
obviously but there's black white and
gold<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.520> both<00:00:47.700> models<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
gold for both models and then with the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
gold for both models and then with the
green<00:00:49.500> version<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> s6<00:00:50.940> edge<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.719> blue

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
green version for the s6 edge and a blue

green version for the s6 edge and a blue
version<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.680> s6<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.760> that's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> style

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
version for the s6 so that's the style

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.869 
version for the s6 so that's the style
ticked<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.590> substance<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.640> they've

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
ticked but substance as well they've

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
ticked but substance as well they've
made<00:00:57.090> some<00:00:57.120> obvious<00:00:58.050> key<00:00:58.379> upgrades<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.250> you

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
made some obvious key upgrades as you

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920 
made some obvious key upgrades as you
see<00:00:59.579> when<00:00:59.760> they<00:00:59.879> launched<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.329> new<00:01:00.480> flagship

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
see when they launched a new flagship

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.299 
see when they launched a new flagship
you've<00:01:01.109> got<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> faster<00:01:01.739> processor

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
you've got a faster processor

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
you've got a faster processor
interestingly<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> chip<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> actually<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
interestingly the chip is actually now a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
interestingly the chip is actually now a
Samsung<00:01:04.799> made<00:01:05.040> chip<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:05.850> Qualcomm<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.570> got

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
Samsung made chip not Qualcomm it's got

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
Samsung made chip not Qualcomm it's got
arm<00:01:06.960> technology<00:01:07.590> behind<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.970> for

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
arm technology behind it so going for

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
arm technology behind it so going for
their<00:01:09.210> own<00:01:09.299> chips<00:01:09.630> they've<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.110> faster

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
their own chips they've got a faster

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.740 
their own chips they've got a faster
brighter<00:01:11.189> camera<00:01:11.850> they've<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.270> better

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
brighter camera they've got better

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
brighter camera they've got better
battery<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.979> say<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.280> faster<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> charge

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
battery they say it's faster to charge

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
battery they say it's faster to charge
in<00:01:15.540> 10<00:01:15.750> minutes<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.650> hours<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
in 10 minutes you can get two hours of

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
in 10 minutes you can get two hours of
video<00:01:18.030> watching<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:18.960> battery<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
video watching out of this battery and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
video watching out of this battery and
indeed<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.280> wirelessly<00:01:21.000> charge<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
indeed you can also wirelessly charge it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
indeed you can also wirelessly charge it

that's built in although what people
don't<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.720> fact<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> battery

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
don't like is the fact that the battery

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
don't like is the fact that the battery
can<00:01:25.650> no<00:01:25.740> longer<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.159> taken<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.180> used<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> be

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
can no longer be taken out as used to be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
batteries on you if you're out in the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
batteries on you if you're out in the
field<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.650> day<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.369> but
