samsung did quite a bit better I'm not
entirely<00:00:49.770> sure<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.370> happened<00:00:50.910> why<00:00:51.120> they

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
entirely sure what happened why they

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.680 
entirely sure what happened why they
didn't<00:00:51.540> scale<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.110> too<00:00:52.739> well<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.540> just

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
didn't scale to too well but they just

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.799 
didn't scale to too well but they just
didn't<00:00:55.080> they<00:00:55.559> onedrive<00:00:56.430> scores<00:00:56.820> nearly<00:00:57.239> 700

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
didn't they onedrive scores nearly 700

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.189 
didn't they onedrive scores nearly 700
but<00:00:57.960> both<00:00:58.110> together<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.769> 10<00:00:59.360> not<00:01:00.360> even<00:01:00.600> 1100

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
but both together get 10 not even 1100

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
but both together get 10 not even 1100
together<00:01:01.470> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> bummer<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.120> what

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
together this is a bummer not sure what

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
together this is a bummer not sure what
happened<00:01:03.330> but<00:01:03.570> um<00:01:03.840> people<00:01:04.410> in<00:01:04.619> our<00:01:04.710> forum<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
happened but um people in our forum that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
happened but um people in our forum that
it<00:01:05.460> didn't<00:01:05.670> happen<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.300> getting

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it didn't happen to them they're getting

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.320 
it didn't happen to them they're getting
1200<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.640> don't<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:08.910> happened<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
1200 so I don't know what happened but

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
1200 so I don't know what happened but
either<00:01:09.479> way<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.080> samsungs<00:01:10.500> did<00:01:10.740> score<00:01:11.160> better

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
either way the samsungs did score better

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
either way the samsungs did score better
quite<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.440> if<00:01:13.530> that's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
quite a bit I don't know if that's

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
quite a bit I don't know if that's
because<00:01:13.800> they<00:01:14.190> have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> newer<00:01:14.550> firmware<00:01:14.910> or

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
because they have a newer firmware or

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
because they have a newer firmware or
intro<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:15.899> whatever<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.470> did<00:01:16.649> scale

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
intro or whatever but they did scale

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
intro or whatever but they did scale
better<00:01:17.630> maybe<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.899> nerd<00:01:19.200> didn't<00:01:20.130> scale

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
better maybe my nerd didn't scale

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
better maybe my nerd didn't scale
because<00:01:20.610> they're<00:01:20.820> old<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.720> sure<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.410> they

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
because they're old not sure but they

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240 
because they're old not sure but they
didn't<00:01:23.009> do<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.789> they<00:01:23.820> performed<00:01:24.330> bless<00:01:25.250> now

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
didn't do it so they performed bless now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.320 
didn't do it so they performed bless now
for<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> pricing<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.830> enforced<00:01:29.280> $25<00:01:30.000> deeper

yeah we were comparing 64 for someone's
Jorge<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.200> maybe<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.649> 128<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.460> fours<00:01:38.970> oh<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
Jorge so maybe a 128 and fours oh you

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.679 
Jorge so maybe a 128 and fours oh you
know<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.110> faster<00:01:40.500> oh<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.130> okay<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:41.939> 120<00:01:42.540> m

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
know it's faster oh yeah okay then 120 m

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.140 
know it's faster oh yeah okay then 120 m
4<00:01:42.930> 30<00:01:43.380> faster<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.610> ones<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> get

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
4 30 faster so those are the ones to get

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.719 
4 30 faster so those are the ones to get

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
away from the stri you have 256 gigs of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.749 
away from the stri you have 256 gigs of
storage<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> read<00:02:07.229> super<00:02:08.220> fast<00:02:08.429> SSD

storage you know and read super fast SSD

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.380 
storage you know and read super fast SSD
so<00:02:09.470> as<00:02:10.470> far<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.769> looks<00:02:11.040> go<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.610> Samsung<00:02:12.030> choice

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so as far as looks go the Samsung choice

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.750 
so as far as looks go the Samsung choice
crucial<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:14.160> that's<00:02:14.250> something<00:02:14.430> crucial

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
crucial I think that's something crucial

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
crucial I think that's something crucial
can<00:02:15.090> work<00:02:15.299> on<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.720> maybe<00:02:16.790> updating<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.060> little

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
can work on is maybe updating the little

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.810 
can work on is maybe updating the little
casing<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.320> comes<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> goes<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
casing that comes with this goes that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.130 
casing that comes with this goes that
sticker<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> other<00:02:21.840> side<00:02:22.200> better<00:02:22.829> yeah

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
sticker on the other side better yeah

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.180 
sticker on the other side better yeah

feature<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:23.330> smaller<00:04:24.330> profile<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.020> will<00:04:25.229> be

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260
