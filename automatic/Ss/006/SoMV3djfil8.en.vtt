all<00:00:01.650> right<00:00:01.829> well<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.190> for<00:00:02.490> one<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.730> my

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
all right well this is for one of my

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.490 
all right well this is for one of my
commenters<00:00:03.600> that's<00:00:03.870> having<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.290> lot<00:00:04.470> of

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
commenters that's having a lot of

trouble getting a pulse motor to work

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.169 
trouble getting a pulse motor to work
and<00:00:07.500> I've<00:00:08.130> seen<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.519> happen<00:00:08.580> many<00:00:08.910> times

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
and I've seen this happen many times

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.310

work when you don't have to do that when

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.640 
work when you don't have to do that when
you're<00:00:23.760> starting<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:25.019> build<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> really

really simple one and this is what I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.380 
really simple one and this is what I
call<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> kitchen<00:00:28.410> countertop<00:00:29.090> Reed<00:00:30.090> switch

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
pulse motor and the little arrow thing
is<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> Reed<00:00:33.809> switch<00:00:34.140> when<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> magnet<00:00:34.890> goes

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is the Reed switch when the magnet goes

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.869 
is the Reed switch when the magnet goes
by<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:36.840> pulls<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> switch<00:00:38.460> closed

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
by that it pulls the switch closed

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.260 
by that it pulls the switch closed

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
that led to light up using just a

light up with a double-a battery you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.710 
light up with a double-a battery you

have to use this fly back from the coil

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.020 
have to use this fly back from the coil
and<00:02:29.720> if<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.350> just<00:02:30.590> move<00:02:30.980> them<00:02:31.310> Naing<00:02:31.790> that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and if you just move them Naing that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.650 
and if you just move them Naing that
over<00:02:32.270> them<00:02:32.450> we<00:02:33.170> switch<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:37.970> make

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
over them we switch you can now make

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.699 
over them we switch you can now make
that<00:02:38.720> LED<00:02:39.530> go<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:43.190> by<00:02:43.400> opening<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.300> closing

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
that LED go just by opening and closing

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.030 
that LED go just by opening and closing
that<00:02:45.709> switch<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:47.150> back<00:02:47.930> spike<00:02:48.590> that

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
that switch it's the back spike that

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.630 
that switch it's the back spike that
causes<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.730> led<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.330> go<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:50.930> anyway<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:52.430> my

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
causes that led to go but anyway in my

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.580 
causes that led to go but anyway in my
comment<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.420> gentlemen<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:53.959> suggested<00:02:54.530> he

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
comment to the gentlemen I suggested he

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 
comment to the gentlemen I suggested he
just<00:02:54.800> take<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> piece<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.310> cardboard<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.150> put

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
just take a piece of cardboard and put

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.440 
just take a piece of cardboard and put
some<00:02:56.990> magnets<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.580> might<00:02:58.760> work<00:02:59.030> so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
some magnets on it and it might work so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.060 
some magnets on it and it might work so
I<00:02:59.480> thought<00:02:59.900> I'd<00:03:00.020> better<00:03:00.140> see<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.890> was

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
I thought I'd better see if that was

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.550 
I thought I'd better see if that was
even<00:03:01.340> possible<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.990> that's<00:03:03.290> just

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
even possible and it is and that's just

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.110 
even possible and it is and that's just
two<00:03:03.769> magnets

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
two magnets

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.400 
two magnets
I<00:03:05.180> put<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.720> nail<00:03:06.019> through<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:07.090> cardboard<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
I put the nail through the cardboard and

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.400 
I put the nail through the cardboard and
then<00:03:09.410> made<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> bushing<00:03:10.820> using<00:03:11.150> Krazy<00:03:11.450> Glue<00:03:11.840> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
then made a bushing using Krazy Glue and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.870 
then made a bushing using Krazy Glue and
you<00:03:12.500> put<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.769> crazy<00:03:13.040> glue<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.760> it

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
you put the crazy glue on it and it

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.820 
you put the crazy glue on it and it
makes<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.180> plastic<00:03:14.630> bushing<00:03:15.019> when<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.260> sets<00:03:15.590> up

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
makes a plastic bushing when it sets up

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.310 
makes a plastic bushing when it sets up
make<00:03:16.430> sure<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.820> really<00:03:17.060> loose<00:03:17.269> you<00:03:17.989> have<00:03:18.170> to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
make sure it's really loose you have to

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.430 
make sure it's really loose you have to
have<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:19.000> sliding<00:03:20.000> thing<00:03:20.390> for<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.019> here

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
have a sliding thing for it here

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.160 
have a sliding thing for it here
otherwise<00:03:22.070> there's<00:03:22.580> too<00:03:22.730> much<00:03:22.880> friction<00:03:23.239> but

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
otherwise there's too much friction but

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.650 
otherwise there's too much friction but
I<00:03:24.500> wanted<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.430> see<00:03:25.700> if<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.000> would<00:03:26.180> actually

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
I wanted to see if this would actually

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.009 
I wanted to see if this would actually
work<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.519> does<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.150> mean<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:29.570> can<00:03:29.750> build

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
work and it does I mean you can build

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.080 
work and it does I mean you can build
this<00:03:30.170> up<00:03:30.410> 30<00:03:31.160> minutes<00:03:31.370> on<00:03:31.730> your<00:03:31.880> kitchen
