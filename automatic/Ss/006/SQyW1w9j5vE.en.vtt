that<00:00:25.650> works<00:00:25.800> even<00:00:26.160> better<00:00:26.390> I've<00:00:27.390> learned<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that works even better I've learned that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
that works even better I've learned that
this<00:00:27.870> actually<00:00:28.140> isn't<00:00:28.530> a<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:28.980> good<00:00:29.130> solo

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
this actually isn't a really good solo

big lap around the map look at all the

big lap around the map look at all the
tight<00:00:40.020> corridors<00:00:40.409> there's<00:00:40.830> really<00:00:41.129> no<00:00:41.489> place

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
run a circle run a train like you

look<00:00:54.659> I<00:00:54.900> mean<00:00:55.110> everywhere<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
look I mean everywhere you go is just a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.009 
look I mean everywhere you go is just a
tyke<00:00:56.640> corridor<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.449> space<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> where

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
tyke corridor and the space is where

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.200 
tyke corridor and the space is where
there<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.290> open<00:00:58.650> like<00:00:58.830> this<00:00:58.860> they<00:00:59.640> make<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.909> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there are open like this they make it so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.700 
there are open like this they make it so
it's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.750> small<00:01:01.019> enough<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.350> where<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
it's just small enough to where you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
it's just small enough to where you
can't<00:01:01.979> you<00:01:02.610> know<00:01:02.729> you<00:01:02.790> can't<00:01:03.030> can't<00:01:03.839> run<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
can't you know you can't can't run a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.410 
can't you know you can't can't run a
circle<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> essentially<00:01:05.250> treyarch<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.820> try

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
circle it essentially treyarch gonna try

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.670 
circle it essentially treyarch gonna try
to<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> really<00:01:06.870> good<00:01:06.900> job<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> making<00:01:07.500> sure

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to get a really good job of making sure

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120 
to get a really good job of making sure
that<00:01:09.049> making<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> hard<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.500> players<00:01:10.799> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that making it hard on the players so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
that making it hard on the players so
you<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.370> just<00:01:11.610> run<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.299> circles<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.899> that's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you know just run in circles like that's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.709 
you know just run in circles like that's
that's<00:01:13.829> the<00:01:13.979> main<00:01:14.189> zombies<00:01:14.820> strategy<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
that's the main zombies strategy that

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.270 
that's the main zombies strategy that
everyone<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> past<00:01:17.009> maps

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
everyone use for all the past maps

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.709 
everyone use for all the past maps
that's<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.090> got<00:01:18.329> really<00:01:18.659> far<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:20.719> that's

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
that's how you got really far and that's

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.929 
that's how you got really far and that's
why<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.960> kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.170> unrealistic<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:23.130> zombie

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
why it's kind of unrealistic like zombie

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.029 
why it's kind of unrealistic like zombie
apocalypse<00:01:24.479> ever<00:01:24.659> were<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.899> happen<00:01:25.109> and<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
apocalypse ever were to happen and we

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.679 
apocalypse ever were to happen and we
apparently<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.609> just<00:01:26.670> run<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> circle<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
apparently you just run in a circle and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.069 
apparently you just run in a circle and
they<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> never<00:01:28.409> eat<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.859> so<00:01:29.780> but<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
they would never eat you so but in this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.380 
they would never eat you so but in this
map<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.289> definitely<00:01:32.039> not<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> case<00:01:32.399> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
map is definitely not the case we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.929 
map is definitely not the case we
definitely<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.530> moving<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.340> can't

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
definitely have to be moving I can't

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
definitely have to be moving I can't
really<00:01:36.030> camp<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.659> spot<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.859> you<00:01:38.070> hit<00:01:38.189> solo

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
really camp in one spot if you hit solo

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
really camp in one spot if you hit solo
if<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.119> am<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.359> look<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.049> monkey<00:01:40.619> give

must be like world Gymnastics a view
like<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.739> shit<00:03:50.480> unfortunately<00:03:51.480> they<00:03:51.569> can't

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like this shit unfortunately they can't

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.500 
like this shit unfortunately they can't
can't<00:03:52.169> stick<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> landing<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:53.069> oh<00:03:53.280> well<00:03:53.519> um

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
can't stick the landing but oh well um

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.800 
can't stick the landing but oh well um
so<00:03:54.870> yeah<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:56.400> definitely<00:03:56.669> definitely<00:03:57.389> works

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
so yeah it definitely definitely works

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.349 
so yeah it definitely definitely works
out<00:03:58.220> as<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.430> leaderboard<00:03:59.790> Stan<00:04:00.000> right<00:04:00.180> now<00:04:00.329> I

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
out as the leaderboard Stan right now I

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.809 
out as the leaderboard Stan right now I
think<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:01.049> in<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> 40s<00:04:01.919> or<00:04:02.010> 50s<00:04:02.160> are<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.609> top

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
think it's in the 40s or 50s are the top

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.930 
think it's in the 40s or 50s are the top
ones<00:04:03.440> definitely<00:04:04.440> crazy<00:04:05.130> scores<00:04:05.579> I<00:04:05.760> don't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
ones definitely crazy scores I don't

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.759 
ones definitely crazy scores I don't
know<00:04:06.030> what<00:04:06.660> strategy<00:04:07.049> they<00:04:07.169> used<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.440> get<00:04:07.590> that

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
know what strategy they used to get that

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.099 
know what strategy they used to get that
far<00:04:08.060> but<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.419> something<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.900> know<00:04:10.019> you

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
far but this is something you know you

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.020 
far but this is something you know you
can<00:04:10.260> get<00:04:10.470> in<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.160> 20s<00:04:11.549> if<00:04:11.639> you're<00:04:11.760> looking<00:04:11.970> to

do<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.329> for<00:04:12.630> multiplayer<00:04:13.230> what<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.160> would<00:04:14.370> do

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
do that for multiplayer what I would do

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.509 
do that for multiplayer what I would do
it<00:04:15.780> definitely<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.260> best<00:04:16.380> way<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.590> go<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.979> well

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519

your<00:05:13.560> snap<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.100> think<00:05:14.580> it's<00:05:14.730> really<00:05:14.850> creative

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
your snap I think it's really creative

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.800 
your snap I think it's really creative
think<00:05:17.880> it's<00:05:17.970> really<00:05:18.150> creative<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.630> think

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
think it's really creative and I think

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.350 
think it's really creative and I think
it<00:05:19.160> sounds<00:05:20.160> dumb<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.520> say<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.730> a<00:05:20.910> little<00:05:21.210> bit

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
it sounds dumb to say but a little bit

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.350 
it sounds dumb to say but a little bit
more<00:05:21.510> realistic<00:05:21.720> than<00:05:22.850> other<00:05:23.850> maps<00:05:24.120> for<00:05:24.300> you

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
more realistic than other maps for you

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.110 
more realistic than other maps for you
can<00:05:24.450> just<00:05:24.570> run<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:24.810> circles<00:05:24.990> for<00:05:25.260> days<00:05:26.120> you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
can just run in circles for days you

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.350 
can just run in circles for days you
know<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.600> just<00:05:27.930> that's<00:05:28.440> how<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.620> survived<00:05:29.360> but

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
know in just that's how you survived but

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.280 
know in just that's how you survived but
the<00:05:30.540> only<00:05:30.660> thing<00:05:30.750> that's<00:05:31.050> kind<00:05:31.170> of

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
the only thing that's kind of

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.230 
the only thing that's kind of
unrealistic<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:32.190> how<00:05:32.670> are<00:05:32.820> their<00:05:32.970> perk

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
unrealistic is how are their perk

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.200 
unrealistic is how are their perk
machines<00:05:33.660> in<00:05:34.110> an<00:05:34.350> ancient<00:05:34.620> jungle<00:05:35.400> like<00:05:36.030> I

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
machines in an ancient jungle like I

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.450 
machines in an ancient jungle like I
they<00:05:36.360> were<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:37.410> know<00:05:37.530> there's<00:05:37.740> no<00:05:37.890> wires<00:05:38.130> I

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
they were you know there's no wires I

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.130 
they were you know there's no wires I
didn't<00:05:38.670> see<00:05:38.790> like<00:05:39.090> a<00:05:39.210> they<00:05:39.600> running<00:05:39.840> on<00:05:39.960> some

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
didn't see like a they running on some

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.320 
didn't see like a they running on some
double<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.530> batteries<00:05:41.010> or<00:05:41.190> some<00:05:41.610> shit<00:05:41.880> yeah<00:05:42.150> I
