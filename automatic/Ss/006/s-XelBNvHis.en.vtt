 here you go back you go in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.380
 tire smoke 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.729

 beautiful sailboats really means 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.479
 do multiple combinations what 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.450
 the pink the rape and the lime green that makes 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.599
 really beautiful look at the green 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.890
