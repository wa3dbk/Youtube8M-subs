00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.150
 well then welcome to the election 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.090
 let's see now what it is and how it is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.969
 build a matrix keyboard first 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.189
 that nothing we are going to need a card 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.020
 perforated or we can 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:26.369
 build and 16 buttons of the type puig and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.520
 a matrix keyboard is usually a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.009
 link they are is a bus lines 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.010
 verticals and a line bus 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:41.370
 horizontal then what are we going to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 to do is let's name abcdy line 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:51.290
 here we are going to name the numbers 1 2 3 4 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.690
 of these four wires that are of 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.260
 vertical way 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.940
 let's put a connected button here 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.870
 of the cable 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 to the cable one that is horizontal and not 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.780
 here we are going to put another button that is going to 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 be this is going to be the a1 button this is going to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 be the b1 button this is going to be the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.130
 button 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.070
 c 1 this is going to be the 1 button and so 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.070
 let's put the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.920
 to 2 the 16 buttons 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.560
 b2 c2 of 2 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.430
 so let's put the 16 buttons 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.410
 to be our matrix keyboard 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:07.600
 this is going to be the three of three 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.600
 three of three and this is going to be him 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.890
 a 4 b 4 c 4 and a 4 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.980
 and then in this way we have four 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 vertical lines four girls 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.870
 horizontal and sixteen buttons well 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.150
 Well, to start 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.600
 let's use our card 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.240
 perforated 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.470
 and we're going to define how we're going to want 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.520
 our buttons and firstly 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.069
 let's give some space 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.999
 in extra 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.299
 and then we will place our buttons 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:03:02.260
 that are aligned we decided 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 how separated or how close together 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.560
 we want 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.110
 then we are going to place them 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.350
 salvation buttons and that you in something 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.570
 spaced so that it is 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.570
 and aesthetic also has to do 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.690
 you have to see also that these buttons 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.130
 they have a side if they put all of the 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.980
 same side are perfectly 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.500
 aligned if we put this is because 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.350
 have from here 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.660
 a distance from here to the terminals and 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.330
 from the other corner of the terminals are 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.890
 different distances then you can 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:56.610
 give us a little deviated yes if you notice 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.959
 there it is well aligned if I put one 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.959
 upside down 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.310
 it shows in the alignment 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.910
 has been removed then you have to put them 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.910
 all with the same orientation 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:06.040
 since we have the 16 buttons aligned 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.990
 then we will mark our card 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.600
 to know where we will have to cut 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.830
 then we are going to give a similar margin 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.830
 to this side 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.379
 we make some small marks for 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.750
 know where to cut and we will give a 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.750
 margin similar to this side 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:52.700
 fine then since we have our 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.010
 our buttons placed we put a 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.010
 sheet like that and we put him to bed 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.090
 to proceed with welding 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:09.749
 since we have a line four lines 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.749
 vertical we are going to bend the terminals 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.949
 of the buttons 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.000
 a single terminal 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.000
 for welding 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.889
 if they are fixed 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:27.889
 I'm going down 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.970
 only one terminal 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.320
 of each line of the buttons and I know 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.320
 well how is he staying here 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:48.960
 yes under nothing else 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.960
 in the terminal of the buttons yes 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.950
 although it only remains 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.040
 this is why 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:17.250
 see how it has to be done 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:20.370
 on a sheet to herself so that marsans 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.100
 and then we go down 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.580
 the finished ones 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.580
 Y 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.870
 then already in this way it does not come out 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.870
 plus 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.330
 the buttons yes 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.720
 well then in the next one in the 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.900
 next video let's see how it 

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.240
 solder the terminals and place the 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.949
 cables to be able to finish our 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.949
 matrix keyboard thank you very much
