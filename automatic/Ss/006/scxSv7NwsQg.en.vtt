00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:27.907
I'm son of the asphalt

00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:30.967
protected by the night

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.640
I have the heaven as roof

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.020
And as mattress the lawn

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.620
I'm a rambler

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.140
The streets are mine

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.640
I'm a rambler

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.300
The streets are mine

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
As street inhabitant

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.780
I live happy and glad

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.440
I'm good at gleaning

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.220
And the best recycler

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.860
I'm a rambler

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.740
The streets are mine

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.840
I learned everything on the street

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.200
It is my university

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.060
and in every corner I have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.940
a lookout to the world

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840
I'm a rambler

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.520
The streets are mine

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.580
The streets are mine

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940
I'm of the moon

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.800
and the sun always walks with me

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240
Little lilly bud, wallflower bud

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.960
You always know that streets are for you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.680
I'm protected by the night, I ride with you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.100
I'm a rambler

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.620
This son is from Colombia, for everybody to enjoy it

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.160
With you, I want to dance my great son

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.140
I'm a rambler

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.580
Come to dance my rambler son
