 generally a special magic 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:13.999

 to beings from another planet that come here just 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.360
 at this moment to see what is happening we are strong the 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 energy that these spend their literary genres 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.140

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.619
 landín clearly we can see an event that is not normal 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.330

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 that's the problem that's why the concern 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.960
 I have a huge 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.289
