00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 quite different from the mottos already 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.350

 other teams are both but I did not leave 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.410

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.800
 also met the file there is going to leave 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.110
 case of the world and will be down here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.390
 chain is the potato that the texture mode 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.550
 see the team two points so I go 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 never enter show this super mode 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.539
 That's cool, and I just do not agree. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 that the game kept with the world with 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.680
 I saw your vein here on the screen that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 home redstone and how professional it is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 well there is a lot of relationship and I realized that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.520
 he has a spine that I do not know 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.369
 what the boss the text yet is not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 because I'm thigh but the company but knows 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.350

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.520
 third lot that is, we also have 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 these other businesses that are pretty cool 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.270

 only moggi that I do not know if I'll do 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.020
 a review by joÃ£o moutinho that left 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.360
 the mold will still come out but it is this way 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.119
 which is super cool same time piston is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.799
 professor and plate engine is here 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.460
 I do not know what I want, it's bloch me last. 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.600
 This is not a java file I've already seen. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 which gives the population 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 but the real thing is the post works 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.549
 perfectly also the editions also 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.820
 if here I'll put here that O 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.149
 And here I do not know, I do not need it so much. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.549
 Yes, but I'm fine. 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.869
 opa did not work was already is and then 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.240
 People change, it 's super cool, I 'm not going to do it. 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.160
 detailed review of it because I'm with 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.920
 a little time so far is not that not 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.910
 I like you since it's soon I came 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 here screaming that she wore clothes and says 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.709
 who knows, mother is mother, and then 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.209
 People also have children like that. 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.190
 things that we find cool these kids 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.260
 it is not a dictatorship is not 100% 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.239
 still functional because some people 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.040
 are judged when he repeated that he is 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.769
 appearing here but you can use 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.019
 perfectly, as I'm trying to do 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.880
 go back to doing exactly what everything is going 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:43.480
 do because I do not really know why 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.950
 then it is good I'm sorry that my cart 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.000
 it's just going to happen I do not know how it is 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:57.000
 have to do is cool 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 the consumption of pcs like pushing a button and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.630
 memory has so little space 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.799
 memory then it was fast then it goes 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.019
 providing the video had who 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.030
 develops the I think it was a note and 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.410
 caught a day in the video and if you liked 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.380
 this year when the fault of one of the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.269
 My favorites are I'm wrong here because 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.590
 because the solar property and has to save 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.989
 This video here can not be more 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.970
 short that the goal because 49 mega 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.590
 free memory helsinki did not stay long 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.930
 well you're low on memory 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.519
 so we make use of the video highlighting the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.519
 blame all this space with the 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.200
 partners that gives the registration there I 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.269
 I recommend they are there always 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.090
 and then I told the download link 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.370
 It's from the municipality and I'm not going to leave it. 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 that goes from the link then it was even 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.230
 You've spoken and times club by 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.230
 renovation
