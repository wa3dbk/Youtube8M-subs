00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.950
 welcome to the channel creating where they are 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.810
 the games implications for your mobile 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.910
 do not take off from the screen 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.079
 give us a line and do not forget 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.079
 subscribe well 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.210
 okay 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.540
 hello this as such from youtube and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.520
 we are here in a new video about the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.380
 android and good today let's see how 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.170
 we can do a little more fluid in 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.250
 our mobile phone very well this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.800
 application 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.150
 this indispensable requirement to be a user 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.980
 root then if you're not root 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.750
 to this this explanation is not going to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.750
 serve nothing then very well let's go 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.960
 to check what those applications are 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.080
 very the application that we are going to use is the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.890
 swap see what is this that is here 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.470
 but before you install it and open it 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.730
 we are going to have to download a 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.129
 application that is called abusive 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.140
 although this one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 this application is free the can 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 find in google play or also there 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.600
 is your pay version there you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 they choose which one they want to use very well 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.729
 once we download the bus and box 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.880
 This open it and they will appear this 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.799
 window very well once you have already 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.799
 appeared this window you what 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.080
 they will do is give it to install but 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.150
 before they have to search here is not 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.700
 they have to select the second 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.659
 the box that says system bar xvii 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.640
 is 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.700
 Once you have already selected this 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.149
 box they're going to do they're going to 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.429
 install then once installing going 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.020
 to start doing a process and once 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.109
 I finished 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.790
 sometimes it takes a little bit this once 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.680
 who finishes making the process 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.860
 what will he do 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.360
 very well once you have finished 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.280
 install, as I was saying, it's going to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.770
 appear in green those that appear 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.590
 in red it does not matter if so 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.900
 You can now close the application in this 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.930
 application will basically serve us 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.270
 to install some files that are going 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.209
 to be useful in order to open other 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.180
 applications then not just for 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.740
 the software but for other applications 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.650
 then I recommend it to be what 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.840
 download and install it very well 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.390
 then what we are going to do is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 install the swap in the swap but it's a 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.620
 free application and can 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.659
 find then on the google play 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.659
 and they're going to pay us nothing for it 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.550
 You see this is the application and already 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.350
 download and install it and we will 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.310
 proceed to open it you download 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.290
 cell or does not weigh much and they download and 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.210
 is what they will serve well be a 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.180
 once downloaded installed what are we going to 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.670
 to do is to open it once it would have opened 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.540
 this application that we are going to do we are going 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.850
 to check this box and in this we only 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.220
 is going to give an option then there's 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.580
 that being in it is the one below where 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.280
 says swap fight 6 is the amount of 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.580
 megas that you want the program 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.910
 test that you bone for example if you 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.300
 you come 200 megas what you're going to do is 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.950
 you will have 200 megabytes of ram 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.010
 obviously this ram memory will be 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.299
 virtual will not be 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.500
 it's real it's like on the computer that 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.120
 could increase your ram memory 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 connecting a usb usb and this and then 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.209
 so it was increasing then this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.329
 application serves you for that for 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.760
 increase your virtual great memory is 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.340
 virtually and what is going to be then is going to 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.849
 be that your phone works a little more 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.879
 faster then once you have 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.340
 chosen the megas that want to use this one 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.010
 they will give the button that said sab or 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.260
 be saved and he will ask permission 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.660
 superuser you accept and as you see 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.260
 here he says creating a new file his 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.660
 app and we wait for it to load 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.090
 because then the truth is going to serve us 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.580
 much for example if your cell phone goes 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.110
 little slow then this application will 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.080
 will help you have a little more 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.150
 fluency and you will not have a fluency 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.060
 for example let's suppose that the mind 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.860
 up to a thousand megs of ram and you're going to 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.169
 have a super phone because the truth 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.440
 is that no no also does not do miracles 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.490
 but it's going to help you a bit so that 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.979
 your phone does not 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.410
 as slow as I was before and the truth 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.240
 It has helped me because before 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.780
 I put a lunch a launcher that was the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.360
 windows 8 and this one I ran it very slow 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.060
 you work on transitions and that and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.710
 once I install the super because I already 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.990
 started running a little faster 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.780
 So the truth is that I say yes 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.669
 It worked and I hope that you 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.689
 paul and try it and tell me if you 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.879
 it works or it did not work 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.069
 not all expulsion phones 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.069
 clarified but then to me yes 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.650
 well the truth 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.490
 It has served me well here 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.440
 loading the truth is that it takes a 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.220
 I'm going to pause the video a bit and 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.290
 right now right now setback as seen already already 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.480
 loaded the application and a 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.390
 message that said the process has been 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.980
 completed and very well what are we going to do 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.860
 to check that if it has not been installed 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.690
 the file and if it's not going to work we 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.060
 we go to our explorer to our 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.840
 preferred browser in this case here 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.780
 I have one and we're going to look for a file in 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.000
 our card sd the file will be 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.320
 loose of our sd card and the two 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.610
 it seems that here is the swap point sw 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.980
 So that means that if it has 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.560
 installed the file and if it's going to 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.910
 work here we also have a 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.950
 file that is called here they see it in the 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.270
 bus and box that means that also 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.020
 the bus and box and has installed us 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.680
 correctly 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.780
 As you see, the truth itself has 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.629
 installed install it try it and I 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.020
 they say that they are clarified that not all 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:35.330
 it's going to work like me like that but 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.610
 you can download only and prove it 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.030
 nothing costs them capable and makes them a little 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.069
 more faster your mobile phone 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.389
 then they put that has been all how 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.180
 make our flow a little more 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.970
 phone and then check the other gel 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.530
 video that we are going to see of how how 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.289
 enter into recovery mode without the 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.659
 key combinations with a program 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.069
 of course being a root user until we 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:00.250
 we see until the next 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.250
 bye
