out of the path that leads them to very

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.659 
out of the path that leads them to very
few<00:04:59.419> options<00:04:59.810> to<00:05:00.650> one<00:05:00.860> where<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> entire

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
few options to one where the entire

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.120 
few options to one where the entire
world<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.210> thrown<00:05:02.450> open<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.930> them<00:05:03.140> as<00:05:03.620> long<00:05:03.980> as

the motivation the potential is there
the<00:05:06.710> sky's<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.010> limit<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:08.620> think<00:05:09.620> if<00:05:09.890> we<00:05:10.100> just

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
the sky's the limit I think if we just

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.430 
the sky's the limit I think if we just
wear<00:05:10.610> garden<00:05:11.150> will<00:05:11.390> be<00:05:11.540> prepared<00:05:12.050> for<00:05:12.110> college

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
wear garden will be prepared for college

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.250 
wear garden will be prepared for college

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
because this one is actually a great

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.540 
because this one is actually a great
opportunity<00:05:18.230> for<00:05:18.620> all<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.070> kids<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.370> are
