00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
this gameplay clip finishes so that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
this gameplay clip finishes so that
gives<00:00:43.980> me<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> nice<00:00:44.760> advantage<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.480> it's

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
gives me quite a nice advantage and it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
gives me quite a nice advantage and it's
just<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> fun<00:00:46.020> play<00:00:46.559> style<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> incorporate<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
just a fun play style to incorporate the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.490 
just a fun play style to incorporate the
lunge<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:48.989> bit<00:00:49.140> inconsistent

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
lunge can be a little bit inconsistent

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
lunge can be a little bit inconsistent
but<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.149> pretty<00:00:51.300> balanced<00:00:51.840> in

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
but I think it's pretty balanced in

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
but I think it's pretty balanced in
terms<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> goes<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.399> mean<00:00:53.610> I've

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
terms of the way it goes I mean I've

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.459 
terms of the way it goes I mean I've
sacrificed<00:00:53.910> pretty<00:00:54.570> much<00:00:54.719> everything<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.320> my

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
sacrificed pretty much everything on my

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
sacrificed pretty much everything on my
class<00:00:55.710> except<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.309> knife<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.789> return<00:00:57.360> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
class except for my knife in return for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
class except for my knife in return for
perks<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.230> through<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.460> not

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
perks so I think through that it's not

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
perks so I think through that it's not
overpowered<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.480> quite<00:01:00.750> balanced<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.379> it's

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
overpowered it's quite balanced so it's

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.080 
overpowered it's quite balanced so it's
a<00:01:01.710> lot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> fun<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> you'll<00:01:02.910> notice

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a lot of fun to do and you'll notice

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
a lot of fun to do and you'll notice
that<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.390> come<00:01:03.570> piece<00:01:03.989> together<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that you come piece together a lot of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.840 
that you come piece together a lot of
kills<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.670> fun

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
kills like that it is a lot of fun

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
kills like that it is a lot of fun
although<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.229> have

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
although a lot of the time you will have

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
although a lot of the time you will have
to<00:01:07.500> flank<00:01:07.770> around<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> map<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> sneak<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.210> on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to flank around the map and sneak up on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.090 
to flank around the map and sneak up on
people<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> another<00:01:10.350> thing<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
people and another thing is that this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
people and another thing is that this
gameplay<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.610> purely<00:01:12.119> knife<00:01:12.450> only<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
gameplay is purely knife only which is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
gameplay is purely knife only which is
something<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.070> thought<00:01:14.430> I'd<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
something I just thought I'd do just to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
something I just thought I'd do just to
show<00:01:15.479> off<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.840> gold<00:01:16.110> combat<00:01:16.619> knife<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
show off the gold combat knife and it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.380 
show off the gold combat knife and it's
something<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.610> usually<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
something I don't usually do which is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
something I don't usually do which is
quite<00:01:19.110> fun<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.560> I've<00:01:19.680> been<00:01:19.860> trying<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
