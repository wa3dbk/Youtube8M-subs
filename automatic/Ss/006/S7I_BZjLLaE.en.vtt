00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 yes 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.080
 my life 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.900
 Hi, I'm 20 and in this video 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.310
 teach how to make these pretty roses 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.570
 paper you can use for any 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 decoration and materials are a leaf 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.000
 of paper 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.550
 to scissors and that's it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 for now and we go what we first go to 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 do let's take our sheet of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.770
 paper and let's take a tip towards 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 a base a good corner towards a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.730
 shore and we are going to fold this forming a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.970
 square and then we cut it out this 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.700
 step I think it is 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.470
 a universal step will give us a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.930
 square in this way now what 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.230
 we are going to do is going to make the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.230
 folds 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.809
 from the corners of a point of the box 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.869
 towards another like that of tam and from one side towards 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.869
 other 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.330
 and also from the other side 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 God 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 and then let's go and we'll keep this 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.330
 now something important we are going to join the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.890
 tips of our square all the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.010
 four-pointed tips we're going to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.960
 lead towards to put together rather 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.390
 trying to form a diamond 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.990
 in this way we take these points well 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.689
 and then the other one 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.689
 we are going to stay this time of course 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.260
 that's why we made the folds 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.490
 I understand what 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.870
 well now it 's a part a bit 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.140
 more complicated 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.930
 let's take the tip of the diamond where 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.510
 there's no where our loose and what 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.240
 let's do it's going to be double 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.730
 let's double it 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.750
 a bit like about two centimeters 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.480
 now let's take a 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.750
 shore 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.879
 and we're going to take her to her side trying 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.599
 that there is a report or that is left 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.360
 well from the center to the tip of the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.799
 rhombus in this way we were all going to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.959
 do the same with the four that follow 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.840
 we are going to take only one 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.430
 address here it looks better what 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.430
 I try to say let's do this 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.790
 and the same with the back 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.790
 remember that is the same address 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:58.849
 Sorry if I did not speak more strongly 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.430
 Now we will open the carefully 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.129
 this is going to be 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.840
 with a tip in the center we're going to 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.340
 mark very well the folds this is 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.650
 supposes that it should remain as a 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.480
 square but what we're going to do is going to 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.439
 to be crush it anyway I do not know 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.439
 worry not going to see 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 we turn the square and it's going 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.569
 to be these things as well as how 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.520
 depth so I do not know how 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.500
 explain it 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.570
 and what we're gonna do is gonna sound we 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.020
 to take a tip and we will take it to 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.020
 a shore 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.099
 to help us make it easier 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.769
 let's take our finger and already after 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.300
 we mark the doubles is only this 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.580
 step only to mark folds 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.630
 let's do the same with the four 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.810
 the three missing 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.750
 carry and we lean with your finger and 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.140
 then we mark 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.480
 easy after we have left like this the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.850
 four what we are going to do is going to be a 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.690
 unsurpassed type take them all but to the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.260
 all at the same time towards the same 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.940
 address 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.940
 trying to form a cylinder 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.910
 try in if it is not the folds do not 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.709
 they will notice like that if it wrinkles a little 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.130
 everything is arranged that final 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.440
 good not everything but if everything will be fixed 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:29.409
 let's take the cylinder and we're going 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.379
 take will stay like this from this part 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.889
 and from the other part of where it's like 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:38.060
 hole 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:41.560
 and here we are going to take the banks towards 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.560
 the center in 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.830
 well squashed like that so you do not 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.319
 release and now my part of the turn 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.500
 We are gonna give 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:55.639
 roll the corners in this way 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.460
 since 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.169
 well in addition to a little bit bad but after 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.379
 I fixed it 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.430
 and here is the flower lie 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:10.580
 since today since we have folded all 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.550
 the thorns rolled up let's go to the center 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.960
 We'll roll it up anyway 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.650
 help with the scissors we roll it up and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.289
 we perfected the petals as well and what 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.860
 we carry in at the same time 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.229
 but we do not stay like that anymore 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.969
 and so is a bit with a little more 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.969
 weather 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.309
 to record 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:36.419
 I hope you liked it remember
