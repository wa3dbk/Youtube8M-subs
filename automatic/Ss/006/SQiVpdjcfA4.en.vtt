00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hello 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.380
 they say sinister call-of- dead gameplay 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.030
 man's warfare I offer a chair that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.860
 take out on the map this the horizon I think 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.930
 which is called since with the tenth one 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.310
 that really is the chelest weapon in the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.349
 game but well I just have the 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.060
 grid was that playing with eric and I 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.040
 they came out even as I say of gusts and such 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.079
 but I want to use them to tell you about 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.700
 another theme the background gameplay or 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.070
 it's just basically not as good 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.800
 as I'm saying, but today 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.450
 Friday, January 9, the league mode opens 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 of placing more warfare are the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.630
 classification games that is 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.340
 practically the same but officially 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.980
 opens what is being the league mode 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.070
 so I have to propose a new one 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.950
 series that I want to do that I want me to 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.740
 have also if it seems to you not the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.120
 series would obviously be in the 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.100
 first season of league mode to see 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 where would we come from doing a lives in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.490
 the games obviously I will not 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.740
 upload all because there are many games 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.390
 would play for example about five or six 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.460
 games and the one that I got the best was the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.780
 would obviously rise when the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.700
 season and know where I've been 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 I will upload episodes I will upload 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.159
 good games departures evidently 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.900
 bad 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.670
 I do not expect to burst in 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.280
 because they are going to be all the bike to the king 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.500
 but as I say, I think it may be 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.200
 pretty good then tell me what you 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.490
 seems the idea because it is a series that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.080
 I think that individually it can be very 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.690
 well to see how far we get 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.640
 I also do not have many expectations 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.040
 expectations of reaching high since there are 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 people very very very tainted with very people 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.600
 good playing mostly in teams one 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.310
 which is where they play every where 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.320
 it plays to the competitive is all the people 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.580
 but it's there basically because it's the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.080
 console where it's competitive and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.340
 all the pros obviously play 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.550
 in one not because that's where the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.020
 tournaments so I do not expect much to get 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.250
 very far but yes I do not know I think that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.450
 it can be pretty good to see where 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.060
 I will be season after season 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 see if we improve and such and I do not know how to tell me 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.119
 what do you think about the idea because I do not have 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.250
 no active series in the channel and I 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.140
 I think it can be pretty good and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.850
 as i say i will upload bad good games 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.190
 games that lose games that wins 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.260
 but inside the good you can always 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.570
 choosing the best is not clear 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.340
 not like I say either do not expect to see 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.440
 games because that's just going to 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 win or I can create 1020 but 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.010
 have gained 100 points and will be 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.569
 worth is really good going to be going to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.709
 be good for 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.120
 for you to see it and such because 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.370
 simply what it's about is going up 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.499
 and in fact I'm playing a little bit with 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.659
 graphic america to mode we link is 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:29.329
 playing a little bit and they've busted us 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.920
 the vast majority of the items, that is, the 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.079
 people are noticing a lot that they play 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.629
 very much that goes a lot to 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.950
 point van I do not know you could notice it shows a 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.239
 heap the people who play alone the way 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 link the people who play multiplayer 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.780
 because in fact then I put to play 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.010
 a little bit multiplayer and I was 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.689
 commenting the fact with that is that to you 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.250
 he killed two shots I do not know if he killed 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.349
 of two shots or that the connection goes better 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.519
 or something but like that or directly that 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.810
 people are more evil in the others 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.519
 they kill before that can also be 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.109
 what are we going to lie to people 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.150
 model is much better at least in 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.310
 uruguay get all tested there 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.959
 and if you get like a bastard then you do not 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.329
 I know I think it's a personal challenge 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.769
 season after season to see up 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.969
 where I'm able to get there I think it can 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.980
 be pretty good and tell me what you 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.480
 it seems and they are not the chapters that you have 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.849
 for weeks there was that one or two per 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.620
 week surely and well be pretty 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.870
 good kids can be pretty 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.650
 pretty good so I'm waiting with the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.650
 comments leave me 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.630
 and if I like the idea, you 're thinking 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.740
 one thing but I think if you like the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.420
 idea 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.670
 and nothing else was just that 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.200
 a little mode when warfare 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.300
 that since I want to upload it instead 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.650
 of uploading games like that were the ones that 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.170
 come out well I prefer to do a series to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.360
 see how far we get and as I say there's 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.590
 bronze I think that this one produces silver gold 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.570
 platinum 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.240
 teacher and great teacher if I'm not wrong 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.690
 I believe that gold will reach in principle 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.030
 I think it would be worth it and I do not know, I think 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.290
 that you may be thinking or if you aspire to 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.550
 very little but it is that people are very 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.230
 good kids, we have been 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.850
 playing we are in bronze because 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.560
 Well, it's not official yet, but 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.270
 you're there in bronze and I was asking 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.490
 like a real bastard I say it is to be 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.560
 amazing people know a lot of 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.480
 hot spots knows a lot the 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.830
 responsos throw me a lot changing the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.300
 respared so that the other one reappears 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.550
 part of the map and do not get to the point or 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.750
 really be the super flawed people not 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.400
 I know if that's right was a 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.780
 process that but how those strong ones are 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.490
 also bronzes and from little trays to 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.430
 this because if it's not going to get to gold 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.680
 of not coÃ±a but good 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.449
 and there we will be to see where we arrived 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.550
 and as I say I hope you like the idea 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.990
 since he is also thinking and gordon and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.940
 active in the channel let's make a 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.949
 series of modules that can be 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.580
 pretty cool individually to see 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:34.669
 how things go like this and nothing 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.470
 kids just tell you what we 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.419
 we have moved the same I bring you two dishes 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.070
 then I have to see it because 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.360
 obviously this weekend is not 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.460
 in the video I 'm not uploading video 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.199
 weekends I do not like but the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.389
 Monday surely is not sellable cautious 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.590
 you know warfare she 'll see it and it's the 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.610
 that all bring you a good game 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.800
 surely and nothing more kids to train 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.780
 let's take this by the way the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.720
 tlc del alma nos warfare at the end of the month 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.139
 it comes out so we'll also be pretty 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 reeds and I remember him hooking the 27 I think 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.440
 so nothing
