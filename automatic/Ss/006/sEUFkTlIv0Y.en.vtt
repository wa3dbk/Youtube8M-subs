the World Cup in the beginning it seemed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
the World Cup in the beginning it seemed
like<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> difference<00:00:52.110> between

like that was the difference between

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
or or even Argentina I mean when you

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.310 
or or even Argentina I mean when you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
mentioned one or two players Germany was
the<00:01:01.500> team<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:03.210> basically<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the team that that basically is

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.830 
the team that that basically is
described<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.769> team<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> that's<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
described a team and that's what it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.649 
described a team and that's what it
takes<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.290> team<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.640> win<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> World<00:01:08.880> Cup<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> agree

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
takes a team to win a World Cup I agree

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.060 
takes a team to win a World Cup I agree
they<00:01:09.750> were<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> most<00:01:10.140> consistent<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
they were the most consistent from the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.679 
they were the most consistent from the
beginning<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.210> mean<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.510> had

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
beginning to the end I mean they had

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.469 
beginning to the end I mean they had
some<00:01:12.930> bad<00:01:13.560> moments<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.369> against<00:01:14.850> Ghana<00:01:15.090> they

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
some bad moments like against Ghana they

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
some bad moments like against Ghana they
were<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:15.990> brilliant<00:01:16.170> against<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> US<00:01:17.340> team

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
were not brilliant against the US team

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.160 
were not brilliant against the US team
but<00:01:19.110> overall<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.700> showed<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.960> best

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but overall I think they showed the best

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
but overall I think they showed the best
teamwork<00:01:22.619> they<00:01:23.310> had<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:23.790> good<00:01:23.970> bench<00:01:24.270> very

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
teamwork they had a very good bench very

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
teamwork they had a very good bench very
good<00:01:25.140> quality<00:01:25.409> young<00:01:26.280> players<00:01:26.610> who<00:01:26.729> will

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
good quality young players who will

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.020 
good quality young players who will
still<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.680> four<00:01:29.189> years<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
still be around for in four years so I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.789 
still be around for in four years so I
think<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.450> deserve<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.020> title<00:01:31.350> that's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
think they deserve the title that's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.679 
think they deserve the title that's
that's<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> scary<00:01:32.700> part<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.210> mean<00:01:33.390> they're

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
that's the scary part I mean they're

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.160 
that's the scary part I mean they're
this<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.350> German<00:01:34.829> team<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this the German team is not one of the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
this the German team is not one of the
older<00:01:37.470> teams<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> tournament<00:01:38.130> they're

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
older teams in the tournament they're

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
older teams in the tournament they're
going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> players<00:01:39.930> they're

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
going to have a lot of players they're

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.480 
going to have a lot of players they're
going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.439> coming<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.009> four<00:01:41.220> years

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
going to be coming back in four years

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
going to be coming back in four years
and<00:01:41.640> they've<00:01:42.299> already<00:01:42.479> won<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.740> had<00:01:43.829> been

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and they've already won one it had been

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.350 
and they've already won one it had been
a<00:01:44.009> long<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.520> didn't<00:01:44.759> realize<00:01:45.000> how<00:01:45.119> long<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
a long time I didn't realize how long it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.090 
a long time I didn't realize how long it
had<00:01:45.450> been<00:01:45.479> since<00:01:45.600> Germany<00:01:46.200> had<00:01:46.350> won<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> World

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
had been since Germany had won a World

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.980 
had been since Germany had won a World
Cup<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> had<00:01:47.549> been<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> pretty<00:01:48.119> long<00:01:48.390> time<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
Cup it had been a pretty long time and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.859 
Cup it had been a pretty long time and
at<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.590> time<00:01:49.799> since<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.189> had<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> trophy<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
at one time since they had the trophy so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.450 
at one time since they had the trophy so
but<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.560> even<00:01:52.649> scarier<00:01:53.040> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
but they're going to be even scarier in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
but they're going to be even scarier in
four<00:01:53.670> years<00:01:53.909> more<00:01:54.149> experience<00:01:54.270> they've<00:01:54.930> all

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
four years more experience they've all

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
four years more experience they've all
had<00:01:55.259> World<00:01:55.500> Cup<00:01:55.710> experience<00:01:55.920> apart<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:56.790> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
closer all of them pretty much will come

better<00:05:37.620> team<00:05:37.800> well<00:05:37.980> in<00:05:38.310> my<00:05:38.940> opinion<00:05:39.060> they<00:05:39.840> were

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
better team well in my opinion they were

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.180 
better team well in my opinion they were
the<00:05:40.020> better<00:05:40.140> team<00:05:40.260> because<00:05:40.710> they<00:05:40.860> created

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
the better team because they created

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.860 
the better team because they created
more<00:05:41.310> chances<00:05:41.669> they<00:05:41.820> defended<00:05:42.270> way<00:05:42.480> better

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
more chances they defended way better

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.500 
more chances they defended way better
I<00:05:43.020> enjoy<00:05:43.590> my<00:05:43.740> disagree<00:05:44.220> I<00:05:44.400> well<00:05:44.820> on<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.150> second

I enjoy my disagree I well on a second

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.730 
I enjoy my disagree I well on a second

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.140 
although it's like a couple reasons look
there<00:05:47.100> was<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.220> couple<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.520> flops<00:05:47.790> here<00:05:48.030> and

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
there was a couple of flops here and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.790 
there was a couple of flops here and
there<00:05:48.300> when<00:05:48.510> when<00:05:48.810> when<00:05:49.230> Argentina<00:05:49.590> had<00:05:49.710> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
there when when when Argentina had the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.290 
there when when when Argentina had the
ball<00:05:49.919> no<00:05:50.070> attacking<00:05:50.370> some<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.240> these

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
ball no attacking some of these

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.360 
ball no attacking some of these

with<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:53.700> header<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.150> then<00:05:54.240> Palacio<00:05:55.169> had

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
with that header and then Palacio had

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.140 
with that header and then Palacio had
the<00:05:55.800> Chester<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.310> he<00:05:56.370> could<00:05:56.550> he<00:05:56.669> could<00:05:56.850> easily

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
the Chester and he could he could easily

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.690 
the Chester and he could he could easily

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
watching to me Argentina was a better

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.659 
watching to me Argentina was a better
team<00:06:12.450> because<00:06:12.750> they<00:06:12.900> played<00:06:13.169> better<00:06:13.410> defense

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
team because they played better defense

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.940 
team because they played better defense
and<00:06:14.669> and<00:06:15.270> they<00:06:15.390> had<00:06:15.510> more<00:06:15.660> chances<00:06:15.930> if<00:06:16.470> one<00:06:16.860> of

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
and and they had more chances if one of

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.830 
and and they had more chances if one of
those<00:06:17.010> chances<00:06:17.310> was<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.490> goal<00:06:17.730> that<00:06:17.970> was<00:06:18.510> that

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
challenges that can be had it right and

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.850 
challenges that can be had it right and
the<00:06:59.300> thing<00:06:59.479> that<00:06:59.630> we<00:06:59.780> have<00:06:59.960> to<00:06:59.990> notice<00:07:00.410> the

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
the thing that we have to notice the

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.680 
the thing that we have to notice the
teams<00:07:01.130> who<00:07:01.310> are<00:07:01.370> most<00:07:01.610> successful<00:07:01.759> they<00:07:02.630> were

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
teams who are most successful they were

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.249 
teams who are most successful they were
playing<00:07:02.990> with<00:07:03.620> no<00:07:04.630> recognizable<00:07:05.630> forward

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
playing with no recognizable forward

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.020 
playing with no recognizable forward
right<00:07:06.560> they<00:07:06.860> played<00:07:07.099> like<00:07:07.310> this<00:07:07.520> fake

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
right they played like this fake

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.050 
right they played like this fake
attacker<00:07:09.220> Germany<00:07:10.220> is<00:07:10.310> a<00:07:10.340> very<00:07:10.789> good<00:07:10.910> example

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 
attacker Germany is a very good example

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.810 
attacker Germany is a very good example
and<00:07:11.570> I<00:07:11.630> think<00:07:11.660> maybe<00:07:12.020> this<00:07:12.259> is<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.710> the<00:07:13.610> death

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:13.820 
and I think maybe this is the the death

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.260 
and I think maybe this is the the death
of<00:07:14.120> that<00:07:15.039> classical<00:07:16.039> number<00:07:16.430> nine<00:07:16.610> right<00:07:17.090> as

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.270 
of that classical number nine right as

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.920 
of that classical number nine right as
they<00:07:17.449> say

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
they say

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.999 
they say
and<00:07:19.330> obviously<00:07:20.330> that<00:07:20.960> system<00:07:21.560> works<00:07:21.770> very

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:22.009 
and obviously that system works very

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.029 
and obviously that system works very
well<00:07:22.099> when<00:07:22.789> you<00:07:22.849> have<00:07:23.000> a<00:07:23.210> kind<00:07:23.810> of<00:07:24.039> offensive

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 
well when you have a kind of offensive

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.580 
well when you have a kind of offensive
midfielder<00:07:25.190> as<00:07:25.759> a<00:07:25.820> forward<00:07:26.660> so<00:07:27.020> you<00:07:27.380> basically

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
midfielder as a forward so you basically

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.610 
midfielder as a forward so you basically
have<00:07:27.860> one<00:07:28.280> more<00:07:28.849> person<00:07:29.300> in<00:07:29.509> the<00:07:29.780> midfield<00:07:29.960> who

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
have one more person in the midfield who

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.920 
have one more person in the midfield who
can<00:07:30.800> score<00:07:30.889> a<00:07:31.039> goal<00:07:31.250> so<00:07:32.210> now<00:07:32.389> we<00:07:32.449> have<00:07:32.720> four

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
can score a goal so now we have four

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.040 
can score a goal so now we have four
more<00:07:33.080> years<00:07:33.289> Russia<00:07:34.090> will<00:07:35.090> see<00:07:35.330> who<00:07:35.509> get<00:07:35.840> there

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
more years Russia will see who get there
