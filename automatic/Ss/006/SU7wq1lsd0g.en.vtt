what we notice a lot is that this

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.630 
what we notice a lot is that this
happens<00:02:05.989> in<00:02:06.170> low-side<00:02:06.679> scenarios<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.340> someone

they've put this knuckle protection

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300 
they've put this knuckle protection
across<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> back<00:02:25.230> they've<00:02:25.770> made<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.280> a

the stitching goes around it so it's

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.020 
the stitching goes around it so it's
vibration<00:03:46.830> dampening<00:03:47.220> additional
