00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.720 

all<00:02:41.820> right<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.050> here<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.340> finished

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
all right and here is the finished

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.430

product

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.600 

the<00:02:50.440> problem<00:02:50.739> with<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> right<00:02:51.069> one<00:02:51.280> wasn't

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the problem with the right one wasn't

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.470 
the problem with the right one wasn't
even<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.879> it<00:02:52.030> broke<00:02:52.239> it<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.930> at<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.709> wiring

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
even that it broke it was at the wiring

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.580 
even that it broke it was at the wiring
basically<00:02:55.480> wasn't<00:02:55.840> connected<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.440> way

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
basically wasn't connected all the way

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.460 
basically wasn't connected all the way
so<00:02:56.950> before<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.550> buy<00:02:57.849> instead<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.110> new<00:02:59.290> ones

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so before you buy instead of new ones

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.650 
so before you buy instead of new ones
make<00:02:59.860> sure<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.280> take<00:03:00.519> them<00:03:00.640> out<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.480> make

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
make sure you take them out and you make

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.630 
make sure you take them out and you make
sure<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.379> not<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.860> bulb<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.459> that

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
sure that it's not the bulb is that

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.170 
sure that it's not the bulb is that
isn't<00:03:04.000> actually<00:03:04.300> broken<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:07.060> was

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
isn't actually broken because that was

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.059 
isn't actually broken because that was
the<00:03:07.330> problem<00:03:07.540> with<00:03:07.660> mine<00:03:07.900> just<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
the problem with mine just the

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.860 
the problem with mine just the
connection<00:03:09.519> wasn't<00:03:09.819> fully<00:03:10.629> in<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:12.129> plug<00:03:12.400> so

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
connection wasn't fully in the plug so

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.750 
connection wasn't fully in the plug so
but<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:13.959> still<00:03:14.140> swap<00:03:14.410> them<00:03:14.590> out<00:03:14.739> just<00:03:15.580> because

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
but we still swap them out just because

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.920 
but we still swap them out just because
these<00:03:15.970> look<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.299> lot<00:03:16.450> better<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:17.620> uh<00:03:18.750> I'll<00:03:19.750> show

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930
