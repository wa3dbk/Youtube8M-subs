and<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.890> glutes<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.670> side<00:02:33.910> sometimes

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
and the glutes in the side sometimes

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.960 
and the glutes in the side sometimes
even<00:02:34.900> hamstring<00:02:35.500> sometimes<00:02:36.460> enough

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
even hamstring sometimes enough

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.570 
even hamstring sometimes enough
flexibility<00:02:37.720> in<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.020> supporting<00:02:38.530> leg<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
flexibility in the supporting leg and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.580 
flexibility in the supporting leg and
very<00:02:40.420> often<00:02:40.660> people<00:02:40.960> do<00:02:41.230> not<00:02:41.350> have<00:02:41.530> enough

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
very often people do not have enough

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.770 
very often people do not have enough
strength<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.790> endurance<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.570> hip

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
strength and endurance and the hip

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.350 
strength and endurance and the hip
flexor<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.860> should<00:02:45.100> bring<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.850> high

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
flexor that should bring up a high

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.380 
flexor that should bring up a high
chamber<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:48.250> throw<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.730> true<00:02:49.030> push<00:02:49.330> kick<00:02:49.770> okay

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
chamber to throw a true push kick okay

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.940 
chamber to throw a true push kick okay
so<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.630> easier<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.230> bring<00:02:53.410> up<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.680> slightly

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
so it's easier to bring up a slightly

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.150 
so it's easier to bring up a slightly
lower<00:02:54.310> chamber<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:56.110> slow<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.740> snap

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
lower chamber and then slow a snap

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.720 
lower chamber and then slow a snap
function<00:02:58.140> okay<00:02:59.140> however<00:02:59.380> if<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.190> saw<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.580> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
function okay however if you saw in a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.460 
function okay however if you saw in a
snap<00:03:01.000> funk<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.480> against<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.959> surface

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
snap funk it against the surface

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.370 
snap funk it against the surface
especially<00:03:03.280> at<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:04.000> own<00:03:04.150> hip<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.840> abdominal

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
especially at your own hip or abdominal

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.980 
especially at your own hip or abdominal
level<00:03:05.770> if<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.580> saw<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.000> snap<00:03:07.090> fun<00:03:07.540> kick<00:03:07.750> it's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
level if you saw it snap fun kick it's

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.100 
level if you saw it snap fun kick it's
just<00:03:08.170> gonna<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:09.209> okay<00:03:10.209> remember<00:03:10.450> travels

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
just gonna go up okay remember travels

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.979 
just gonna go up okay remember travels
in<00:03:11.260> an<00:03:11.350> arc<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:13.120> here<00:03:13.570> I'm<00:03:14.260> showing<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.860> kick

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
in an arc so here I'm showing the kick

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.600 
in an arc so here I'm showing the kick
it's<00:03:16.989> not<00:03:17.260> going<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> go<00:03:17.620> straight<00:03:18.220> into<00:03:18.430> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
it's not going to go straight into the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.900 
it's not going to go straight into the
target<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.180> not<00:03:19.209> travel<00:03:19.780> up<00:03:20.459> okay<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:21.520> it's<00:03:21.850> not

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
target is not travel up okay so it's not

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.229 
target is not travel up okay so it's not
gonna<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.300> any<00:03:22.450> force<00:03:22.720> if<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.950> saw<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.430> low<00:03:24.730> snap

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
gonna be any force if you saw a low snap

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.270 
gonna be any force if you saw a low snap
one<00:03:25.600> tick<00:03:27.180> then<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.420> will<00:03:28.540> be<00:03:28.630> fours<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:30.100> you

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
one tick then they will be fours if you

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.100 
one tick then they will be fours if you
try<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.550> show<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.090> little<00:03:31.239> bit<00:03:31.450> higher<00:03:31.720> to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
try to show it a little bit higher to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.720 
try to show it a little bit higher to
the<00:03:33.010> abdomen<00:03:33.550> or<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.000> hip<00:03:34.330> level<00:03:34.950> then<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.519> have

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the abdomen or a hip level then you have

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.509 
the abdomen or a hip level then you have
to<00:03:36.910> extend<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.510> kick<00:03:37.690> forward<00:03:38.220> now<00:03:39.220> once

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
to extend the kick forward now once

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.850 
to extend the kick forward now once
again<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:40.090> very<00:03:40.360> difficult<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:41.350> bring<00:03:41.530> up<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
again it's very difficult to bring up a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.940 
again it's very difficult to bring up a
high<00:03:42.070> chamber<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.790> then<00:03:43.570> push<00:03:43.900> then<00:03:44.739> won't

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
high chamber and then push then won't

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.530 
high chamber and then push then won't
people<00:03:45.400> bring<00:03:45.730> up<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.000> little<00:03:46.239> bit<00:03:46.330> lower

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
people bring up a little bit lower

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.720 
people bring up a little bit lower
chamber<00:03:47.100> extend<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.610> then<00:03:48.840> push<00:03:49.840> forward

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
chamber extend and then push forward

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.289 
chamber extend and then push forward
okay<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.590> target<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.310> have<00:03:54.700> paper<00:03:55.000> here

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
okay so so the target I have paper here

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.180 
okay so so the target I have paper here
it<00:03:55.390> looks<00:03:55.570> like<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:56.250> up<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.040> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
it looks like this up out just in the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.640 
it looks like this up out just in the
knee<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.549> then<00:04:01.209> boom<00:04:01.510> push<00:04:02.049> forward

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
knee and then boom push forward

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.130 
knee and then boom push forward
so<00:04:03.459> it's<00:04:03.670> really<00:04:03.880> about<00:04:04.060> half<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> foot<00:04:04.600> too<00:04:04.930> so

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
so it's really about half a foot too so

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.750 
so it's really about half a foot too so
over<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.950> push<00:04:06.190> okay<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:08.410> that's<00:04:09.250> good<00:04:09.519> bad

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
over the push okay now that's good bad

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.780 
over the push okay now that's good bad
different<00:04:10.480> well<00:04:11.290> it's<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.860> useful<00:04:12.070> adoption

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
different well it's a useful adoption

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.300 
different well it's a useful adoption
you<00:04:13.420> can<00:04:13.660> see<00:04:14.230> useful<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.769> option<00:04:15.070> to<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
you can see useful the option to the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.490 
you can see useful the option to the
movement<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.209> do<00:04:16.359> not<00:04:16.540> have<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.870> lift<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.320> high

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
movement you do not have to lift a high

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.770 
movement you do not have to lift a high
chamber<00:04:17.830> at<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.190> same<00:04:18.459> time<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:19.419> get<00:04:19.630> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
chamber at the same time you get the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.409 
chamber at the same time you get the
power<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.380> push<00:04:20.739> kick<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.400> once<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.210> kick

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
power of the push kick and once the kick

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.320 
power of the push kick and once the kick
pushes<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> hip<00:04:24.100> flexion<00:04:24.370> no<00:04:24.729> longer<00:04:25.150> has

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
pushes and the hip flexion no longer has

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.140 
pushes and the hip flexion no longer has
to<00:04:25.479> stabilize<00:04:26.340> because<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.490> hip<00:04:27.640> flexor<00:04:28.000> will

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
to stabilize because the hip flexor will

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.050 
to stabilize because the hip flexor will
have<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.360> stabilize<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.930> pretty<00:04:29.260> high<00:04:29.470> kick

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
have to stabilize a pretty high kick

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.760 
have to stabilize a pretty high kick
right<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.419> hip<00:04:31.570> flexor<00:04:31.990> no<00:04:32.140> longer<00:04:32.470> has<00:04:32.620> to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
right the hip flexor no longer has to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.790 
right the hip flexor no longer has to
stabilize<00:04:33.060> that's<00:04:34.060> one<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.690> two<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.530> do<00:04:35.680> not

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
stabilize that's one and two you do not

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.469 
stabilize that's one and two you do not
have<00:04:36.010> to<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.460> flexibility<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.360> the

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
have to have the flexibility of the

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.400 
have to have the flexibility of the
hamster<00:04:37.930> because<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:39.160> extend<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.669> kick<00:04:39.850> here

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
hamster because to extend the kick here

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.279 
hamster because to extend the kick here
doesn't<00:04:41.410> take<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:41.680> much<00:04:41.710> flexibility<00:04:42.550> as<00:04:42.640> Duke

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
doesn't take as much flexibility as Duke

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.279

at<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.099> final<00:04:53.490> moment<00:04:53.669> not<00:04:54.419> only<00:04:54.779> with<00:04:55.619> your

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
at the final moment not only with your

at the final moment not only with your

quadricep by extending the knee but you

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.950 
quadricep by extending the knee but you
also<00:04:57.839> push<00:04:58.430> with<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.669> back<00:04:59.879> of<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.449> body<00:05:00.659> the

also push with the back of the body the

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:03.869 
posterior chain you also use more

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.200
