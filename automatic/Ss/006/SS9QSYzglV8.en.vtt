00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
just take the foam and just start

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.370 
just take the foam and just start
squeezing<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:23.660> start<00:02:24.660> twisting<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.140> into

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
squeezing it and start twisting it into

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.550 
squeezing it and start twisting it into
the<00:02:25.470> body<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> pen

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.070 

and<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.099> want<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:36.720> want<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> have

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
and what you want to do you want to have

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.589 
and what you want to do you want to have
something<00:02:37.319> that's<00:02:38.250> about<00:02:40.519> 1/4<00:02:41.519> or<00:02:41.879> 1/8<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.480> an

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
something that's about 1/4 or 1/8 of an

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.800 
something that's about 1/4 or 1/8 of an
inch<00:02:42.720> sticking<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.910> probably<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
inch sticking out you can probably go a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.190 
inch sticking out you can probably go a
little<00:02:46.379> bit<00:02:46.670> shorter<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.569> then<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.959> feather

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
little bit shorter and then just feather

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.360 
little bit shorter and then just feather
the<00:02:49.410> edge<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:50.760> like<00:02:50.879> that<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.099> there<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.220> go

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the edge just like that and there you go

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.649 
the edge just like that and there you go
you<00:02:54.150> have<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.420> stylus<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.640> your<00:02:56.640> iPad<00:02:57.030> your

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
you have a stylus for your iPad your

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.680 
you have a stylus for your iPad your
iPhone<00:02:57.900> or<00:02:58.440> your<00:02:58.470> iPod<00:02:58.829> Touch<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.970> let's<00:03:00.510> go

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
iPhone or your iPod Touch and let's go

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.699 
iPhone or your iPod Touch and let's go
ahead<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.549> try<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.849> okay<00:03:03.470> let's<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.590> ahead

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
ahead and try it out okay let's go ahead

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.339 
ahead and try it out okay let's go ahead
and<00:03:04.980> test<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.640> stylus<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.629> when<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.109> are

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
and test the stylus out now when you are

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.110 
and test the stylus out now when you are
using<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> stylus<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.879> hold<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
using the stylus you want to hold it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.479 
using the stylus you want to hold it
down<00:03:09.299> low<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.900> iPad<00:03:10.739> touchscreen<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
down low the iPad touchscreen is a

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.190 
down low the iPad touchscreen is a
capacitance<00:03:12.269> touchscreen<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.890> uses<00:03:14.099> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
capacitance touchscreen and it uses the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.410 
capacitance touchscreen and it uses the
resistance<00:03:16.200> or<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.379> capacitance<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.069> your

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
resistance or the capacitance in your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.449 
resistance or the capacitance in your
skin<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:21.440> move<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> screen<00:03:22.769> back<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.220> forth

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
skin to move the screen back and forth

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.789 
skin to move the screen back and forth
so<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.120> want<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.629> make<00:03:24.720> sure<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.200> have

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
so you want to make sure that you have

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.289 
so you want to make sure that you have
your<00:03:26.040> fingers<00:03:26.430> down<00:03:26.609> low<00:03:26.790> because<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.209> you

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
your fingers down low because if you

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.830 
your fingers down low because if you
don't<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.620> won't<00:03:28.799> work<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.060> right

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
don't it it won't work so just right

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.770 
don't it it won't work so just right
about<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.680> should<00:03:32.430> work<00:03:32.609> as<00:03:32.849> you<00:03:33.480> can<00:03:33.510> see

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
about there should work as you can see

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.690 
about there should work as you can see
it<00:03:34.049> works<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.410> well<00:03:34.530> we'll<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.400> ahead<00:03:35.489> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
it works really well we'll go ahead and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.500 
it works really well we'll go ahead and
do<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:35.880> test<00:03:36.299> here<00:03:37.109> with<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:38.090> let's<00:03:39.090> see<00:03:39.269> how<00:03:39.389> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
do a test here with and let's see how it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.159 
do a test here with and let's see how it
works<00:03:41.450> now<00:03:42.450> let's<00:03:42.630> change<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:45.169> thickness

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
works now let's change the thickness

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.550 
works now let's change the thickness
here

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:02.530
