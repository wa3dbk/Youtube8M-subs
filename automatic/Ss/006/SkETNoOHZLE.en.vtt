00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.220 

this<00:02:23.860> part<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.460> bit<00:02:24.700> tricky<00:02:24.760> grab<00:02:25.570> about<00:02:25.840> six

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
this part is a bit tricky grab about six

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.080 
this part is a bit tricky grab about six
inch<00:02:26.440> long<00:02:26.560> rubberband<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.220> place<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.970> in

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
inch long rubberband and place it in

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.120 
inch long rubberband and place it in
inside<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.870> one<00:02:29.110> opening<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> headband

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
inside of one opening of the headband

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.220 
inside of one opening of the headband
then<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.360> sew<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.630> rubber<00:02:31.900> band

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
then you're going to sew the rubber band

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.600 
then you're going to sew the rubber band
with<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.470> two<00:02:32.800> layers<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.160> head<00:02:33.460> back

with the two layers of head back

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.700 
with the two layers of head back
together<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.750> trick<00:02:35.020> here<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.410> you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
together but the trick here is that you

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.320 
together but the trick here is that you
have<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.100> pull<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.550> rubber<00:02:36.700> band<00:02:37.030> while

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
have to pull the rubber band while

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.020 
have to pull the rubber band while
sewing<00:02:37.660> them<00:02:37.870> together
