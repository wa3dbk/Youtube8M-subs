many farmers are enjoying these cooler
melting<00:00:42.030> temperatures<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> gives<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
melting temperatures as it gives the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the ground temperatures to rise to begin

the ground temperatures to rise to begin
work<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.629> their<00:00:48.750> fields<00:00:49.260> dawn<00:00:50.539> refreeze<00:00:51.539> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
work in their fields dawn refreeze and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.770 
work in their fields dawn refreeze and
then<00:00:52.199> more<00:00:52.829> snow<00:00:53.070> thaw<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.270> cycles<00:00:54.480> as

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
then more snow thaw all these cycles as

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
then more snow thaw all these cycles as
we<00:00:54.870> keep<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.920> big<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
we keep going through that's big it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.939 
we keep going through that's big it
helps<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.870> than<00:00:58.050> say<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
helps you a lot more than say like a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.500 
helps you a lot more than say like a
rainstorm<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.609> thunderstorm<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.390> you've

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
rainstorm or thunderstorm where you've

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.939 
rainstorm or thunderstorm where you've
got<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> pounding<00:01:01.410> rain<00:01:01.559> coming<00:01:01.920> down

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
got all this pounding rain coming down

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.870 
got all this pounding rain coming down
when<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> snow<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.719> slowly<00:01:04.260> thaws<00:01:04.559> out

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
when that snow just slowly thaws out

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.010 
when that snow just slowly thaws out
that<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.119> helps<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that really helps because you just get a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
that really helps because you just get a
slow<00:01:07.350> absorption<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:08.100> soil<00:01:08.520> temperature<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
slow absorption in soil temperature is a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
slow absorption in soil temperature is a
big<00:01:09.540> big<00:01:10.080> factor<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> have

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
big big factor you want you got to have

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
big big factor you want you got to have
enough<00:01:11.700> heat<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> ground<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.380> those

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
enough heat in the ground with those

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.460 
enough heat in the ground with those
like<00:01:14.369> say<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> plant<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.840> those<00:01:16.020> seeds

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like say we go to plant that those seeds

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
like say we go to plant that those seeds
are<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.040> germinate<00:01:17.610> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.330> do

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
are actually gonna germinate if you do

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
are actually gonna germinate if you do
too<00:01:18.720> cold<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> chance<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.340> know

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
too cold there's a chance that you know

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
too cold there's a chance that you know
you<00:01:20.549> put<00:01:20.759> seeds<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you put seeds out there and they get a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.440 
you put seeds out there and they get a
frost<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:24.290> couple<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> inches<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:26.119> if<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.299> gets

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
frost a couple of inches down if it gets

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.179 
frost a couple of inches down if it gets
cold<00:01:27.689> too<00:01:27.930> cold<00:01:28.200> those<00:01:28.470> seeds<00:01:28.710> will<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.979> die

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
cold too cold those seeds will just die

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.670 
cold too cold those seeds will just die
then<00:01:30.150> when<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> gets<00:01:30.869> warm<00:01:31.079> getting<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.560> all

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
then when it gets warm getting them all

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.130 
then when it gets warm getting them all

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of spread out your planting time like

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440 
of spread out your planting time like
you'll<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:46.829> crops<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.329> know

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
you'll have some crops there you know

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.770 
you'll have some crops there you know
maybe<00:01:48.930> they'll<00:01:49.320> mature<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.860> 120<00:01:50.640> days<00:01:50.780> like

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
maybe they'll mature in 120 days like

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.120 
maybe they'll mature in 120 days like
for<00:01:51.990> corn<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.890> some

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
for corn and then you'll have some

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.840 
for corn and then you'll have some
they're<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they're like it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.590 
they're like it
ten<00:01:54.230> so<00:01:55.230> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> space<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.250> planning<00:01:56.940> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
ten so you can space out in planning and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
ten so you can space out in planning and
habit<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:59.010> like<00:01:59.130> plan<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
habit so we don't have to like plan it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.310

fertilizers can be very expensive we do

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.180 
fertilizers can be very expensive we do
it<00:02:20.520> because<00:02:20.850> you'll<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> lot<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.190> nitrogen
