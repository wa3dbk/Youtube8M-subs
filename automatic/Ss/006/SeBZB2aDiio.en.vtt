00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.370
 The Fountain of the Lord 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 Jesus said to Jacob in the old days that Joseph was near the land 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:37.710
 He ate in the town of Samaritan 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.739
 Since ancient times Samaritans have never communicated with the Citizens. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.739
 Ah 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:59.170
 I envy your daughter, but just rest here for a while. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.170
 We 'll read 50 and get something to eat. 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.500
 I have a lot of thirst. 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.500
 Can I get a sip of water ? 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.020
 You are a Jew, and I am a Samaria traveler. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 How did you come to ask me for water? 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.259
 Well 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.049
 Ah 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.579
 Whether the gift is what God has another difference to you who I am giving water 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.340
 If I had known 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:46.400
 Rather you asked me. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.400
 Then I would have given you the water produced. 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.020
 How well a teacher so deep 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.380
 Teacher, you do not have to 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 Where are you going to take the floodwaters? 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.310
 The well water is drank our father Jacob to his sons and the anthem map 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.400
 You drank 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.400
 Your teacher is better than the baseball you gave us these wells . 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 Are you talking? 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:44.050
 The person who drinks this well water is thirsty again 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.050
 He who drinks my water will never thirst 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.420
 The water that I give will rise in the person like three waters to make the soul live. 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.420
 will be 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 Teacher 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:09.440
 Give me a monster, and I will not thirst again , but I will draw water . 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.440
 I do not have to come out. 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:20.550
 The acceptance of the Lord's thanksgiving 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.550
 His glory will always be overflowing in his body forever. 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.950
 U 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.450
 That
