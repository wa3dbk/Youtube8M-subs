flexi rod set now this can be done on

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.189 
flexi rod set now this can be done on
blow-dried<00:00:12.330> hair<00:00:12.360> or<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.830> wet<00:00:14.280> hair<00:00:15.199> today's

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
is on wet hair just depends on the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.890 
is on wet hair just depends on the
texture<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.820> how<00:00:20.820> puffy<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.330> want<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> be

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
texture and how puffy you want it to be

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.609 
texture and how puffy you want it to be
when<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.710> finished<00:00:22.769> it'll<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.730> full<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.960> most

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
when it's finished it'll be full or most

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.950 
when it's finished it'll be full or most
of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.859> time<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.240> wet<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
of the time if you do it wet but the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
of the time if you do it wet but the
curls<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.769> tighter<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.240> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
curls will be tighter so it's kind of a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.870 
curls will be tighter so it's kind of a
give<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.500> take<00:00:31.650> with<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.219> choice<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.820> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
set is the end paper and you just take

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.510 
set is the end paper and you just take
it<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.530> fold<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> over<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.189> end<00:01:29.340> after

it and you fold it over the end after
you<00:01:29.729> detangle<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> hair<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.799> wrap<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
you detangle the hair then you wrap it

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.730 
you detangle the hair then you wrap it
completely<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.020> revolution<00:01:34.650> around

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
completely like one revolution around

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.789 
completely like one revolution around
and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.240> won<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.990> rest<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> hair

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and then you won the rest of the hair

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.390 
and then you won the rest of the hair
kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.579> an<00:01:38.729> oblong<00:01:39.630> spiral<00:01:40.409> shape<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
kind of in an oblong spiral shape and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.030 
kind of in an oblong spiral shape and
I'm<00:01:42.150> using<00:01:42.479> all<00:01:42.750> these<00:01:42.899> words<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.740> using

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I'm using all these words but I'm using

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
I'm using all these words but I'm using
it<00:01:44.250> while<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.619> demonstrated<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it while you can see it demonstrated so

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.060 
it while you can see it demonstrated so
it<00:01:47.040> makes<00:01:47.250> sense<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> instead<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> rolling<00:01:49.560> all

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it makes sense so instead of rolling all

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.420 
it makes sense so instead of rolling all
the<00:01:50.280> hair<00:01:50.549> around<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.930> same<00:01:52.229> section<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the hair around the same section of the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.600 
the hair around the same section of the
flexi<00:01:53.820> rod<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.329> roll<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> hair<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> length

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
flexi rod you roll the hair the length

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.819 
flexi rod you roll the hair the length
of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> flexi<00:01:57.390> rod<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.930> stretch<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
of the flexi rod just stretch it out so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.429 
of the flexi rod just stretch it out so
that<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.130> curl<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.689> spiral<00:02:01.110> instead<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
that your curl is a spiral instead of a

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
that your curl is a spiral instead of a
grandma<00:02:04.439> curl<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.490> when<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> say<00:02:06.030> grandma<00:02:06.329> curl

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
grandma curl and when I say grandma curl

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
grandma curl and when I say grandma curl
