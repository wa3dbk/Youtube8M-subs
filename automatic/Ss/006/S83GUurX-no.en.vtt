cooling<00:02:06.570> fans<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.619> we<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.860> selector

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
cooling fans and then we have a selector

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.160 
cooling fans and then we have a selector
switch<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.209> place<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.959> load

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
switch so we can actually place the load

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.290 
switch so we can actually place the load
switch<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.160> load<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:11.700> either<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.150> left

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
switch the load from either the left

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.400 
switch the load from either the left
alternator<00:02:12.870> or

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
alternator or

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
alternator or
right<00:02:13.560> alternator<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.730> course<00:02:14.760> we

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
right alternator and then of course we

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.700 
right alternator and then of course we
have<00:02:15.300> batteries<00:02:15.570> mounted<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> base<00:02:16.500> of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
have batteries mounted in the base of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.650 
have batteries mounted in the base of
the<00:02:16.770> display<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.700> basically<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.120> everything

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
the display so basically just everything

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.510 
the display so basically just everything
like<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.960> would<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.410> real<00:02:19.620> car<00:02:19.890> so

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
like you would have on a real car so

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.450 
like you would have on a real car so
we'll<00:02:20.610> go<00:02:20.730> ahead<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.970> switch<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:28.220> as<00:02:29.220> you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
we'll go ahead and switch it on as you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.540 
we'll go ahead and switch it on as you
can<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.240> spinning<00:02:31.400> let<00:02:32.400> our

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
can see it's now spinning let our

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.580 
can see it's now spinning let our

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
right at 740 rpm or so and we'll go

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.790 
right at 740 rpm or so and we'll go
ahead<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> switch<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> couple<00:02:42.420> loads<00:02:42.800> turn

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.150 
ahead and switch on a couple loads turn
on<00:02:43.950> our<00:02:44.160> cooling<00:02:44.580> fans<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:46.710> can<00:02:46.830> hear<00:02:47.040> them

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
on our cooling fans you can hear them

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.010 
on our cooling fans you can hear them
running<00:02:47.370> there<00:02:47.670> we'll<00:02:48.480> switch<00:02:48.690> on<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020

is<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.260> show<00:02:51.440> kind<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.920> standard<00:02:52.340> standard

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
is to show kind of a standard standard

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.150 
is to show kind of a standard standard
load<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.810> know<00:02:53.900> maybe<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.290> vehicle<00:02:54.980> with<00:02:55.130> a

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
load you know maybe a vehicle with a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.370

and ignition and with the headlights on

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.290 
and ignition and with the headlights on
that'd<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.650> pretty<00:03:00.830> comparable<00:03:01.700> load<00:03:02.090> to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
that'd be a pretty comparable load to

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.340 
that'd be a pretty comparable load to
what<00:03:02.450> we<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.750> right<00:03:02.959> now

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
what we have right now

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.309 
what we have right now
now<00:03:03.890> we'll<00:03:04.069> go<00:03:04.190> ahead<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.490> switch<00:03:05.330> on<00:03:05.540> the

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
now we'll go ahead and switch on the

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.120 
now we'll go ahead and switch on the
billet<00:03:06.709> tech<00:03:06.890> alternator<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:09.080> has<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.770> soft

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
billet tech alternator it has a soft

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.000 
billet tech alternator it has a soft
start<00:03:10.550> delay<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:11.930> actually<00:03:12.200> ramps<00:03:12.800> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
start delay so it actually ramps the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.930 
start delay so it actually ramps the
current<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.819> slowly<00:03:14.209> so<00:03:15.080> that<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.440> doesn't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
current in slowly so that it doesn't

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.150 
current in slowly so that it doesn't
doesn't<00:03:16.940> chirp<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.480> belt<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:18.620> shudder<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
doesn't chirp the belt or shudder the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160 
doesn't chirp the belt or shudder the
engine

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
engine

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.900 
engine
and<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.650> can<00:03:20.770> see<00:03:20.920> it's<00:03:21.070> making<00:03:21.490> right<00:03:21.700> at

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
and you can see it's making right at

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.370 
and you can see it's making right at
about<00:03:22.560> 125<00:03:23.560> amps<00:03:24.010> or<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.490> at<00:03:24.850> 13.8<00:03:25.780> volts<00:03:26.200> you

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
about 125 amps or so at 13.8 volts you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.710 
about 125 amps or so at 13.8 volts you
can<00:03:26.830> notice<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.580> cooling<00:03:28.030> fans<00:03:28.300> sound

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
can notice that the cooling fans sound

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.490 
can notice that the cooling fans sound
much<00:03:28.960> healthier<00:03:29.440> now<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:31.180> Bob<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.840> RPMs

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
much healthier now and it's Bob the RPMs

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.170 
much healthier now and it's Bob the RPMs
down<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:33.070> about<00:03:34.320> 716<00:03:35.320> rpm<00:03:35.860> or<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.850> see<00:03:37.030> the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
down to about 716 rpm or so you see the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.360 
down to about 716 rpm or so you see the
headlights<00:03:37.510> are<00:03:37.780> also<00:03:37.900> nice<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.470> bright

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
headlights are also nice and bright

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.509 
headlights are also nice and bright
and<00:03:40.670> it's<00:03:40.819> holding<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.720> know<00:03:41.810> about<00:03:42.160> 118<00:03:43.160> amps

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
and it's holding you know about 118 amps

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
and it's holding you know about 118 amps
or<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:43.849> thirteen<00:03:44.810> point<00:03:45.110> nine<00:03:45.200> volts

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
or so thirteen point nine volts

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.380 
or so thirteen point nine volts
now<00:03:46.980> we'll<00:03:47.190> go<00:03:47.340> ahead<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:47.550> switch<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:47.850> over<00:03:48.060> to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
now we'll go ahead and switch it over to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.380 
now we'll go ahead and switch it over to
the<00:03:48.660> delco<00:03:49.560> based<00:03:49.860> alternator<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.760> see<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
the delco based alternator and see the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.550 
the delco based alternator and see the
difference

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.750 

so<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.370> see<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:57.069> cooling<00:03:58.069> fans<00:03:58.370> are

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so you can see the cooling fans are

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.809 
so you can see the cooling fans are
running<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.900> little<00:04:00.020> bit<00:04:00.230> slower<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:01.400> voltage

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
running a little bit slower the voltage

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.030 
running a little bit slower the voltage
is<00:04:02.060> significantly<00:04:02.660> lower<00:04:02.930> about<00:04:03.620> twelve

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
is significantly lower about twelve

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.160 
is significantly lower about twelve
point<00:04:04.310> three<00:04:04.400> volts<00:04:04.970> now<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:05.390> cold<00:04:05.690> this

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
point three volts now this is cold this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.930 
point three volts now this is cold this
alternators<00:04:06.770> not<00:04:06.950> even<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.280> temperature<00:04:07.700> yet

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
alternators not even to temperature yet

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.750 
alternators not even to temperature yet
so<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.750> voltage<00:04:09.230> will<00:04:09.560> actually<00:04:09.890> go<00:04:10.100> down<00:04:10.370> as

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
so that voltage will actually go down as

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.809 
so that voltage will actually go down as
the<00:04:10.819> alternator<00:04:11.540> gets<00:04:11.900> hot<00:04:12.110> from<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.500> load<00:04:12.950> as

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
the alternator gets hot from the load as

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.180 
the alternator gets hot from the load as
you<00:04:13.970> can<00:04:14.120> see<00:04:14.300> it's<00:04:14.540> only<00:04:14.810> making<00:04:15.020> about<00:04:15.920> 80

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
you can see it's only making about 80

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.150 
you can see it's only making about 80
