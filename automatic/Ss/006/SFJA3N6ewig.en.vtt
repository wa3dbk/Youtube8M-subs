00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.820
 hello good to all I'm winter freud and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 Today I 'm going to show you how to make books 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.919
 delighted and how they are used well for 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.480
 that you do not know the enchanted books are 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.030
 these objects that you can see that I have 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.100
 so let's see let's put the first of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.969
 all 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.640
 and video settings we're going to put a 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.989
 interface scale that looks better for 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.550
 that you can see it well thing that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.699
 I usually do not do well and we come here 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.000
 and we see that for version 1.4 6 of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.219
 minecraft mohan has added all these 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.079
 enchanted books with the different 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.719
 enchantments that we can put to 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.339
 team to weapons to tools and everything 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.890
 we have everything here, you can take it out 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.869
 so if you are in creative mode or if you are not 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.490
 how they are made so simple the only thing 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:09.170
 what you need is a book come to a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.840
 a table of enchantment you put a 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.190
 book and it already leaves you in this case are 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.310
 enchantments of very low level because 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.960
 As you know I do not have books surrounding me 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.729
 the enchantment table so for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
 example let's put this same and see 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.649
 which is efficiency 1 well once what 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.970
 we have as you can see it is very 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.350
 very simple one time like that 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.509
 we have it how it is used because it is so 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.630
 simple as ' new to catch for example 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.310
 our diamond peak we put the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.619
 book the padlock here and already directly 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.659
 we get the diamond peak with 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.040
 Efficiency 1 will ask us for a price like 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.230
 we can always put 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.750
 a name that we can put 5 cojonudo and 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.960
 we already have our peak cojonudo with 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.430
 efficiency 1 and it works great when 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 I'm psychologically creative way in 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.690
 a break so fast but good and nothing 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 that is all 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.820
 you can to make enchantments 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.840
 You can put more shelves 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 books around the table 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 enchantment or simply search 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.929
 in the list and put the charms 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.429
 that ye also like something 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.200
 funny thing I found is that you can 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.310
 put him if I'm not wrong any kind 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 of enchantment or any kind of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.319
 object for example 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.450
 or at least things that you should not 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.090
 put as for example worthy aspect 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.519
 can you see if I find 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.590
 protection against projectiles beating 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.370
 pestrin or line 2 effect should not 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.760
 to be able to put a peak we will see 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.610
 to a worthy aspect because we are effectively 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.379
 let's put an igneous aspect to our 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 pico cojonudo now we go out there with 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.730
 efficiency and a1 and appearance and line 2 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.200
 Well nothing is all that's how it is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.030
 do and how books are used 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.349

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.640
