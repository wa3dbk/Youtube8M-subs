right<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.470> direct<00:01:17.220> interaction

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
right and I have a direct interaction

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.030 
right and I have a direct interaction

with the different information that are
presented<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.690> instance<00:01:21.720> use

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
presented here I can for instance use

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
presented here I can for instance use
these<00:01:23.909> devices<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:25.160> to<00:01:26.160> have<00:01:26.250> an

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.230 

mission<00:01:39.659> information<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.830> can<00:01:41.280> make<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
mission information right I can make it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.060 
mission information right I can make it
easy<00:01:42.509> pathology<00:01:43.200> understand<00:01:43.530> what's<00:01:43.799> going

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
easy pathology understand what's going

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
easy pathology understand what's going
on<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.430> board<00:01:44.640> basically<00:01:45.439> instead<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
on on board basically instead of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.980 
on on board basically instead of
managing<00:01:46.860> systems<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.990> access

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
managing systems you just have to access

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410 
managing systems you just have to access
information<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.610> not<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:54.000> able<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.330> know

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
information and will not be able to know

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.859 
information and will not be able to know
what<00:01:54.600> their<00:01:54.840> architecture<00:01:55.560> behind<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.659> what

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
what their architecture behind so what

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.380 
what their architecture behind so what
we<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.440> here<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> mission<00:01:59.970> centric

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
we have here is a mission centric

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.570 
we have here is a mission centric
concept<00:02:00.869> meaning<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> large

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
concept meaning that there is a large

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.499 
concept meaning that there is a large
place<00:02:02.880> according<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.080> mission<00:02:05.240> but<00:02:06.240> these

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
place according to the mission but these

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229 
place according to the mission but these
large<00:02:07.020> display<00:02:07.440> screen<00:02:07.740> providing<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.970> large

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
display of what is your mission reading

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.390 
display of what is your mission reading
all<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.630> necessary<00:02:12.780> information<00:02:13.400> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
all the the necessary information to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.030 
all the the necessary information to
optimize<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.840> efficiency<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> mission

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
optimize the efficiency of the mission

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
optimize the efficiency of the mission
we<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.269> some<00:02:18.600> traffic

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
we can have here some traffic

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.520 
we can have here some traffic
information<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:21.530> maritime

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
information you can have maritime

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.130 
information you can have maritime
information<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.030> still<00:02:24.510> interact

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
information and you can still interact

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.009 
information and you can still interact
directly<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.890> every<00:02:26.700> item<00:02:26.940> display<00:02:27.720> here

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
directly with every item display here

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.150 
directly with every item display here
coming<00:02:28.769> on<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.819> mission<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.980> can

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
coming on the mission so that you can

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.979 
coming on the mission so that you can
quickly<00:02:32.340> access<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:33.090> every<00:02:33.450> information<00:02:33.720> you

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
quickly access to every information you

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.030 
quickly access to every information you
need

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.800 

so<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:40.209> driver<00:02:41.209> died<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.629> want

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
so the other driver died we want

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.440 
so the other driver died we want
interstate<00:02:42.260> here's<00:02:42.590> also<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.189> fact<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.150> we

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
interstate here's also the fact that we

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.360 
interstate here's also the fact that we
know<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.019> our<00:02:45.140> customer<00:02:45.530> want<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.860> customize

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
know that our customer want to customize

know that our customer want to customize
their<00:02:46.579> cockpits<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.890> basically<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.629> can

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
their cockpits so basically what you can

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.979 
their cockpits so basically what you can
display<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.439> every<00:02:51.890> screen<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:53.420> kind<00:02:53.930> of

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
display on every screen what kind of

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.699 
display on every screen what kind of
information<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.620> need<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:56.290> every<00:02:57.290> mission

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
information you need in every mission

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.890 
information you need in every mission
can<00:02:58.370> be<00:02:58.549> defined<00:02:59.329> by<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:02.180> can<00:03:02.420> just

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
can be defined by and you can just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.720 
can be defined by and you can just
decide<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.680> show<00:03:03.859> what<00:03:04.069> you<00:03:04.190> want<00:03:04.400> at<00:03:04.609> the

place<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.810> are<00:03:06.019> in<00:03:06.170> fact<00:03:06.409> so<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.709> can

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
place you you are in fact so you can

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.979 
place you you are in fact so you can
have<00:03:08.840> some<00:03:09.819> some<00:03:10.819> very<00:03:11.120> intuitive

change from ads you can access mission
if<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.829> mean<00:03:19.069> on<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.609> central<00:03:19.940> screen<00:03:20.180> which

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
if I mean on the central screen which

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.780 
if I mean on the central screen which
121<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.159> it's<00:03:22.609> very<00:03:23.209> very<00:03:24.170> efficient<00:03:24.709> in<00:03:24.889> in
