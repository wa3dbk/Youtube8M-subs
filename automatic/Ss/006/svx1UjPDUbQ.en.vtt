 program icon as you see is here 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170

 deactivate it so they see first the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.600
 gameplay at 30 fps and then we activate it 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 so they can see the difference as 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 can see here is the gameplay that I've 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.380
 recorded at 30 fps right now we do not have 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.509
 I activate the program so they can 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 differentiate opens it right now what 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.369
 we are seeing at 30 fps but now we are going 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.899
 let's activate the video we're going to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.659
 activate let's activate the program 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.250
 sorry as you see here is the gameplay 30 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.009
 fps and now let's activate it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 we just execute it and when here 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 already appears the icon is because it is already 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.550
 the program activated and now we're going to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.220
 reopen the video 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.590
 as you see here is the video is at 30 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.170
 fps and now we can see it at 60 fps 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480
 Here is the program that is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.190
 60 fps as you see the truth is the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.220
 try especially in animes in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 movies you notice quite the difference 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.840
 and then if it is not to your liking simply 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.250
 they close it close the program and good 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.510
