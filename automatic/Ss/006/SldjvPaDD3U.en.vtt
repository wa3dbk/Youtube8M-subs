which<00:02:25.010> guys<00:02:26.950> nexus<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.160> was<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
which guys nexus it was because the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.759 
which guys nexus it was because the
caramel<00:02:29.450> reasoning<00:02:29.840> i<00:02:29.959> think<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.410> little

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
caramel reasoning i think it's a little

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.080 
caramel reasoning i think it's a little
russian<00:02:31.480> but<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.860> let<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.310> now<00:02:35.080> yeah<00:02:36.080> i

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
russian but just to let is on now yeah i

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.170 
russian but just to let is on now yeah i
think<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.420> will<00:02:38.510> act<00:02:38.720> actually<00:02:39.500> looks<00:02:40.090> quite<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
think it will act actually looks quite a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.089 
think it will act actually looks quite a
