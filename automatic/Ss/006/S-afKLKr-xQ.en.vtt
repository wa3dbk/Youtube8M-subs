assault rifles from long range moving on

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
assault rifles from long range moving on
to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> SMG<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.810> surprised<00:01:34.320> how

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to the SMG I was actually surprised how

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.109 
to the SMG I was actually surprised how
little<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:34.920> were<00:01:34.979> affected<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.610> stalker<00:01:35.909> has

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
little they were affected as stalker has

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
little they were affected as stalker has
always<00:01:36.299> had<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> profound<00:01:37.049> effect<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> SMGs

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
always had a profound effect on the SMGs

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.649 
always had a profound effect on the SMGs
and<00:01:38.220> previous<00:01:38.640> games<00:01:38.880> well<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.540> absolutely

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and previous games well it's absolutely

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170 
and previous games well it's absolutely
worth<00:01:40.500> using<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> ARS<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> don't<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.090> I'd

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
worth using on the ARS I don't think I'd

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
worth using on the ARS I don't think I'd
recommend<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> SMGs<00:01:43.409> now<00:01:43.799> moving

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
recommend it for the SMGs now moving

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
recommend it for the SMGs now moving
right<00:01:44.220> along<00:01:44.340> stalkers<00:01:45.030> effect<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> LMGs

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
right along stalkers effect on the LMGs

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
right along stalkers effect on the LMGs
is<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.680> clear<00:01:47.009> as<00:01:47.189> well<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.729> I'm<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.000> quite

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
is very clear as well and I'm not quite

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
is very clear as well and I'm not quite
sure<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.659> worth<00:01:48.810> using<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.320> because

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
sure if it's worth using or not because

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.010 
sure if it's worth using or not because
LMGs<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.369> typically<00:01:50.670> camping<00:01:51.119> weapons<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
LMGs are typically camping weapons but

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.149 
LMGs are typically camping weapons but
if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.409> find<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> way<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.979> successful

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
if you can find a way to be successful

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
if you can find a way to be successful
rushing<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.000> them<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.420> stalker<00:01:54.689> will

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
rushing with them then stalker will

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:55.999 
rushing with them then stalker will
definitely<00:01:55.320> help<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> out

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
definitely help you out

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.590 
definitely help you out
so<00:01:56.159> using<00:01:56.340> stalker<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.880> LMGs<00:01:57.360> really

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so using stalker with LMGs really

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
so using stalker with LMGs really
depends<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:57.960> your<00:01:58.079> playstyle<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
depends on your playstyle but it

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.740 
depends on your playstyle but it
definitely<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> large<00:02:00.119> effect<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
definitely has a large effect so you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.060 
definitely has a large effect so you
might<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.110> try<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
might want to try it out and see if it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.499 
might want to try it out and see if it
works<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.149> said

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
works for you now what I just said

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
works for you now what I just said
really<00:02:03.780> applies<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.350> marksman<00:02:04.770> rifles<00:02:05.130> as

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
really applies to the marksman rifles as

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.889 
really applies to the marksman rifles as
well<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.030> they're<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.299> typically<00:02:06.750> meant

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
well because they're not typically meant

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.330 
well because they're not typically meant
for<00:02:07.079> rushing<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.770> you're<00:02:07.890> camping<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
for rushing and if you're camping in a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.710 
for rushing and if you're camping in a
window<00:02:08.610> stalker<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.270> doesn't<00:02:09.539> serve<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
window stalker really doesn't serve a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.150 
window stalker really doesn't serve a
purpose<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.770> successful

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
purpose but if you are successful

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.130 
purpose but if you are successful
rushing<00:02:11.670> around<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
rushing around with the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.630 
rushing around with the
weapons<00:02:12.470> then<00:02:12.680> stalker<00:02:12.950> will<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.370> make<00:02:13.490> you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
weapons then stalker will just make you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.400 
weapons then stalker will just make you
that<00:02:13.790> much<00:02:14.000> more<00:02:14.180> successful<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.260> good

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that much more successful it's a good

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.020 
that much more successful it's a good
perk<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:15.620> both<00:02:15.980> marksman<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.640> light<00:02:16.880> machine

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
perk for both marksman and light machine

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.730 
perk for both marksman and light machine
guns<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.930> unclear<00:02:18.230> whether<00:02:18.530> it's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
guns it's just unclear whether it's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.770 
guns it's just unclear whether it's
worth<00:02:18.890> three<00:02:19.190> points<00:02:19.459> or<00:02:19.760> not<00:02:19.910> now<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.540> went

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
worth three points or not now I went

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.090 
worth three points or not now I went
ahead<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.020> perform<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.410> same<00:02:21.680> test<00:02:21.920> with

ahead and perform the same test with
these<00:02:22.310> sniper<00:02:22.610> rifles<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.300> surely<00:02:23.600> stocker

these sniper rifles but surely stocker

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.420 
these sniper rifles but surely stocker
doesn't<00:02:24.470> really<00:02:24.620> serve<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> purpose<00:02:25.130> with

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.340 
doesn't really serve a purpose with
snipers<00:02:25.760> realistically<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.959> can't<00:02:27.200> really

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
snipers realistically you can't really

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.660 
snipers realistically you can't really
see<00:02:27.500> where<00:02:27.620> you're<00:02:27.770> going<00:02:27.950> your<00:02:28.250> sights<00:02:28.490> are

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
see where you're going your sights are

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
see where you're going your sights are
swaying<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.060> ton<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.630> really<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:29.900> not<00:02:30.170> a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
swaying a ton and it's really just not a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.410 
swaying a ton and it's really just not a
practical<00:02:30.470> perk<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.220> use<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.550> snipers<00:02:31.970> now

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
practical perk to use with snipers now

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.880 
practical perk to use with snipers now
once<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.750> clip<00:02:33.020> ends<00:02:33.320> we'll<00:02:33.440> move<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:33.620> on

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
once this clip ends we'll move right on

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.080 
once this clip ends we'll move right on
to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> shotguns<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.820> was<00:02:34.940> actually

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
to the shotguns and I was actually

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.910 
to the shotguns and I was actually
surprised<00:02:35.600> how<00:02:35.900> slow<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> move<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:36.860> a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
surprised how slow you move with a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.800 
surprised how slow you move with a
shotgun<00:02:37.190> without<00:02:37.490> stalker<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.390> how<00:02:38.570> much

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
shotgun without stalker and how much

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.540 
shotgun without stalker and how much
it's<00:02:39.020> increased<00:02:39.440> by<00:02:39.620> when<00:02:39.860> you<00:02:39.950> use<00:02:40.190> stalker

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
it's increased by when you use stalker

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.490 
it's increased by when you use stalker
after<00:02:41.180> seeing<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.480> pretty<00:02:41.660> minor<00:02:41.930> effect<00:02:42.350> on

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
after seeing a pretty minor effect on

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.170 
after seeing a pretty minor effect on
the<00:02:42.620> SMGs<00:02:43.069> in<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.310> game<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.610> kind<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.910> figured

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the SMGs in this game I kind of figured

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.490 
the SMGs in this game I kind of figured
it<00:02:44.270> would<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> same<00:02:44.750> with<00:02:44.870> shotguns<00:02:45.320> but

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
it would be the same with shotguns but

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.170 
it would be the same with shotguns but
that<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.770> not<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.130> case<00:02:46.310> at<00:02:46.489> all<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.910> actually

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
that was not the case at all I actually

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.820
