00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.910
 and I wanted to see how the kaiser was here 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 commenting and well this is news 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.099
 for people who have the weight 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.230
 2014 for pc and is that there is a new 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.259
 update and a new patch 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.660
 the patch is 1 the version is 1.0 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.630
 point 1 have to go 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.870
 let's see I will explain where is this 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.829
 fall 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.829
 in statistics 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.510
 Let her know that she has a new 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 upgrade 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.239
 and here as you can see it says update the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.239
 data packet information online 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.460
 the online information box of 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.170
 server I think it's available because 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.070
 yesterday at night I was 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.759
 this time it was not available quality 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.759
 you want to download it like this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.640
 and as you can see there is downloading 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:31.600
 the new patch for 2014 for pc already 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.180
 they know how to update their people 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.650
 have it for pc 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.510
 I think that the console has already come out 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.770
 yesterday or the day before yesterday I think today is Friday and 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.510
 Well, go to set it aside until now 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.210
 that is more or less him 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.000
 the gameplay I do not understand very well the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.480
 filtered pass with what was this in 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.180
 consoles against angles 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.780
 but we'll see how this is going in the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.220
 next gameplays that I will make about 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.680
 the fish 2014 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.040
 I'm also waiting for people 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.270
 PC zack this patch as to 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 the graphics of the faces of the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.800
 players since in my opinion it is not that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.800
 the graphics are bad and it's not that 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.249
 it seems that konami and its designers 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.610
 they smoked it a lot at the time of giving it 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:33.250
 much shine to his face since 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.460
 when the game starts on the menu 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.470
 the cover comes to the right side of the menu 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.080
 left a player comes out 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 when the game came out better this year in 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.750
 the month and on the menu it seemed to me that the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.150
 Messi's face did not agree with the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.860
 body and it was because the color of the face 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.350
 of messi was a little darker than the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.760
 that the neck color of month and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.400
 arms 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.099
 I think there's a small mistake there 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.959
 brightness and contrast but hopefully 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.310
 with this patch settle it with 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.210
 some next patches 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.830
 konami solution to these problems 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.770
 I have also read for today that there are some 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.450
 problems in terms of downloading 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.360
 this patch for pc people already 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.930
 that no one disappears does not disappear 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.540
 in the statistics option 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.609
 I'll leave you here below in the description 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.670
 of the video the link of the patch so that 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.140
 can make that criticism button 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.299
 they appear on the menu and here I do not 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.430
 appeared but with the patch that was 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.969
 with me already appears and I think that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.959
 and also the online mode option 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.209
 I'll leave all of that down here in the 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.620
 description of the video and well let's 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.329
 see what happens after this patch does not 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.200
 I'll be doing another of my own this next 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.090
 gameplay on the patch 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.450
 about what the patch brings and I hope that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.489
 brings good best of all that 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.660
