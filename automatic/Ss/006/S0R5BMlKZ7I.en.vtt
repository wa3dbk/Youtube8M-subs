the<00:00:02.190> split<00:00:02.490> thread<00:00:03.000> technique<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.620> valuable

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
the split thread technique is a valuable

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.240 
the split thread technique is a valuable
addition<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.850> any<00:00:06.060> tires<00:00:06.390> toolkit<00:00:06.990> for<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.099> own

time<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.880> consider<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.750> invaluable<00:00:11.059> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
time I consider it invaluable the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.900 
time I consider it invaluable the
concept<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.780> quite<00:00:13.139> straightforward<00:00:13.910> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
thread is twisted tight again and then

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.670 
thread is twisted tight again and then
wrapped<00:00:22.580> for<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> initial<00:00:24.320> component<00:00:25.320> in

the<00:00:25.800> video<00:00:26.240> I'm<00:00:27.240> using<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.810> heavy<00:00:28.019> thread<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the video I'm using some heavy thread to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
the video I'm using some heavy thread to

I<00:00:32.600> flatten<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> thread<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.309> insert<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> needle

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
I flatten the thread I insert the needle

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.630 
I flatten the thread I insert the needle
and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> thread<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:39.090> consists<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.200> two

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
and then the thread now consists of two

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
and then the thread now consists of two
halves<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:45.300> material<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:46.980> inserting

seals fur insert between the two strands

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.900 
seals fur insert between the two strands
and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:57.120> allowed<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.750> close<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.410> again<00:00:58.910> it's
