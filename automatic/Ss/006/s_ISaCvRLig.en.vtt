okay Melissa kay asks if you had a
charge<00:00:08.160> enough<00:00:08.400> space<00:00:08.700> fear<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.210> water

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
floating into the space station could a

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.150 
floating into the space station could a
fish<00:00:12.210> swim<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> oh<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.650> cool

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
fish swim in it oh how cool

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.750 
fish swim in it oh how cool
yes<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.470> we've<00:00:16.470> done<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.340> swedish

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
yes I we've done this with with swedish

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.550 
yes I we've done this with with swedish
fish<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.330> candies<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.260> special

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
fish the candies but special

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.820 
announcement live
no<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.810> theoretically<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.740> would

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
no but theoretically I think that would

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.099 
no but theoretically I think that would
work<00:00:23.250> water<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.880> uh<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.449> mean<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.840> could<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
work water is uh I mean you could have a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
work water is uh I mean you could have a
tank<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.560> water<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> fish<00:00:27.000> float<00:00:27.269> in

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
tank of water you have a fish float in

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.710 
tank of water you have a fish float in
there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.480 
there
I<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:28.170> don't<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:28.980> why<00:00:29.099> we<00:00:29.220> wouldn't<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
I would don't see why we wouldn't be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
I would don't see why we wouldn't be
able<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.119> water<00:00:30.539> itself<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
able to do that and water itself is it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
able to do that and water itself is it
works<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.040> surface<00:00:32.700> tension<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
works just on surface tension so it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.000 
works just on surface tension so it
doesn't<00:00:33.480> splatter<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.680> were<00:00:34.800> very

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
doesn't splatter so if you were very

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
doesn't splatter so if you were very
creative<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.610> could<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> glob<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> water

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
creative you could get a glob of water

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.810 
creative you could get a glob of water
and<00:00:37.110> try<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> fish<00:00:38.219> they<00:00:38.520> wouldn't<00:00:38.730> even

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and try to get a fish they wouldn't even

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
and try to get a fish they wouldn't even
need<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> tank<00:00:39.420> no<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.989> happy<00:00:40.020> really<00:00:40.320> careful

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
need a tank no be happy really careful

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
need a tank no be happy really careful
as<00:00:40.860> soon<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> hits<00:00:41.579> something<00:00:41.820> it'll<00:00:42.149> it'll

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
as soon as it hits something it'll it'll

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.110 
as soon as it hits something it'll it'll
splatter<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.440> don't<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> fish<00:00:44.160> nosing

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
splatter you don't want to fish nosing

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
splatter you don't want to fish nosing
nuzzling<00:00:45.750> his<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.200> her<00:00:46.320> way<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
nuzzling his or her way out of the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
nuzzling his or her way out of the
sphere<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.820> water<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:48.840> pretty

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
sphere of water right but I'm pretty

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
sphere of water right but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.440> been<00:00:49.530> experiments<00:00:49.980> with

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sure there have been experiments with

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.360 
sure there have been experiments with
with<00:00:51.329> fish<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.840> space<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.829> yes<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
with fish in space and so yes this is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
with fish in space and so yes this is
definitely<00:00:53.969> possible<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:55.140> they'd<00:00:55.410> have

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
definitely possible because they'd have

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
definitely possible because they'd have
some<00:00:55.770> way<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> nice<00:00:56.340> Christmas<00:00:56.520> gift<00:00:56.899> you

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
some way to be a nice Christmas gift you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
some way to be a nice Christmas gift you
know<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.859> met<00:00:59.070> fabulous<00:00:59.719> zero-g

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
know you have met fabulous zero-g

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.270 
know you have met fabulous zero-g
floating<00:01:01.109> around<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.010> pets

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
floating around we have to get pets

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
floating around we have to get pets
flown<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> good<00:01:03.329> way<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
flown and this would be a good way so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
flown and this would be a good way so
right<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.199> we've<00:01:04.379> had<00:01:04.530> fish<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.070> as

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
right now we've had fish as as

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.190 
right now we've had fish as as
experiments<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.510> would<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> nice

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
experiments this would be like a nice

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.320 
experiments this would be like a nice
what<00:01:07.500> animals<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.010> been<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.250> space<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.820> mean

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
what animals have been in space I mean

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.060 
what animals have been in space I mean
with<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.020> astronauts<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.950> like

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
with with astronauts not just like

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.289 
with with astronauts not just like
monkeys<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.580> can't<00:01:11.729> make<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.090> or

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
monkeys that can't make it back or

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
monkeys that can't make it back or
something<00:01:12.510> right<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> dog<00:01:13.320> Laika<00:01:13.650> yeah<00:01:14.220> uh

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
something right or the dog Laika yeah uh

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.789 
something right or the dog Laika yeah uh
it's<00:01:15.090> been<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.659> been<00:01:15.750> spiders<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> space

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it's been there's been spiders in space

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
it's been there's been spiders in space
there<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.189> been<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:18.240> rodents<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
there have been some rodents in the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.249 
there have been some rodents in the
house<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:21.259> experiments

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
house that we use for for experiments

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.700 
house that we use for for experiments
okay<00:01:23.390> so<00:01:24.390> again<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.049> experiments<00:01:25.650> we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
okay so again it's all experiments we

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.350 
okay so again it's all experiments we
let<00:01:25.860> me<00:01:25.950> ask<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> physics<00:01:26.909> question

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
let me ask you this physics question

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.710 
let me ask you this physics question
Mike<00:01:28.049> mass<00:01:28.439> yes<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:30.150> fish<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
Mike mass yes the fish are going to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
Mike mass yes the fish are going to
breathe<00:01:30.930> air<00:01:31.229> dissolved<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.890> water<00:01:32.119> when

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
breathe air dissolved in the water when

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.140 
breathe air dissolved in the water when
you<00:01:33.390> have<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> glob<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> water<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.369> space<00:01:35.670> does

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you have a glob of water in space does

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.859 
you have a glob of water in space does
the<00:01:36.329> air<00:01:37.490> bubble<00:01:38.490> its<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:39.000> effervesce<00:01:39.540> or

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the air bubble its way out effervesce or

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
the air bubble its way out effervesce or
does<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.829> will<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.549> depends<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.420> stay<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
does it will it depends it can stay in

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
does it will it depends it can stay in
