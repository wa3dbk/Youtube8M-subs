what<00:00:08.330> I'd<00:00:08.420> like<00:00:08.570> to<00:00:08.750> do<00:00:08.870> today<00:00:09.050> is<00:00:09.280> describe

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
what I'd like to do today is describe

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:19.870 
what I'd like to do today is describe
another<00:00:12.380> way<00:00:12.559> to<00:00:12.620> use<00:00:12.800> a<00:00:12.830> chi-square<00:00:13.430> table<00:00:18.880> so

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
another way to use a chi-square table so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.120 
another way to use a chi-square table so
what<00:00:20.030> we're<00:00:20.120> gonna<00:00:20.180> do<00:00:20.480> today<00:00:20.660> is<00:00:21.020> we're<00:00:22.010> gonna

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.260 
what we're gonna do today is we're gonna
test<00:00:22.700> for<00:00:23.290> whether<00:00:24.290> or<00:00:24.470> not<00:00:24.560> a<00:00:24.620> gene<00:00:25.010> pair<00:00:25.970> is

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
test for whether or not a gene pair is

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.180 
test for whether or not a gene pair is
linked<00:00:26.630> that<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.650> they're<00:00:27.800> on<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.040> same

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
linked that is they're on the same

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.380 
linked that is they're on the same
chromosome<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:28.970> fairly<00:00:29.300> close<00:00:29.540> together<00:00:30.220> so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
chromosome and fairly close together so

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.639 
chromosome and fairly close together so
Mendel<00:00:32.390> said<00:00:32.629> in<00:00:32.780> his<00:00:33.489> second<00:00:34.489> law<00:00:34.719> that<00:00:35.719> most

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
Mendel said in his second law that most

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.520 
Mendel said in his second law that most
genes<00:00:36.920> assort<00:00:37.550> independently<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:38.450> is<00:00:38.719> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
genes assort independently that is the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.209 
genes assort independently that is the
way<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:39.949> gene<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:41.019> sorts<00:00:42.019> has<00:00:42.440> nothing<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:42.949> do

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
way that gene a sorts has nothing to do

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.360 
way that gene a sorts has nothing to do
with<00:00:43.609> how<00:00:43.850> gene<00:00:44.359> B<00:00:44.719> sorts<00:00:45.199> so<00:00:45.409> we<00:00:46.070> were<00:00:46.190> looking

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
with how gene B sorts so we were looking

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.899 
with how gene B sorts so we were looking
at<00:00:46.699> hair<00:00:47.030> color<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.570> eye<00:00:47.749> color<00:00:47.780> for<00:00:48.350> example

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
at hair color and eye color for example

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.700 
at hair color and eye color for example
whatever<00:00:49.909> hair<00:00:50.149> color<00:00:50.359> you<00:00:50.510> have<00:00:50.719> has<00:00:51.050> nothing

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
whatever hair color you have has nothing

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.930 
whatever hair color you have has nothing
to<00:00:51.859> do<00:00:52.210> with<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.420> color<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:54.019> your<00:00:54.170> eyes<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.940> lot

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
to do with the color of your eyes a lot

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.160 
to do with the color of your eyes a lot
of<00:00:55.999> times<00:00:56.269> that's<00:00:56.510> not<00:00:56.690> true

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
of times that's not true

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.840 
of times that's not true
and<00:00:57.319> the<00:00:57.379> reason<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:57.890> is<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.460> two<00:00:58.640> genes

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and the reason is is that the two genes

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.610 
and the reason is is that the two genes
are<00:00:59.120> actually<00:00:59.539> linked<00:00:59.929> together<00:01:00.109> very

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
are actually linked together very

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.250 
are actually linked together very
closely<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.280> chromosome<00:01:01.819> so<00:01:02.749> they<00:01:02.899> assort

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
closely on the chromosome so they assort

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.980 
closely on the chromosome so they assort
together<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.879> we<00:01:05.030> know<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.420> people<00:01:05.479> for

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
together and we know that people for

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.830 
together and we know that people for
example<00:01:06.080> who<00:01:06.440> have<00:01:07.130> blonde<00:01:07.520> hair<00:01:07.659> tend<00:01:08.659> to

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
example who have blonde hair tend to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.200 
example who have blonde hair tend to
have<00:01:08.930> blue<00:01:09.170> eyes<00:01:09.370> and<00:01:10.370> people<00:01:10.610> have<00:01:10.880> dark<00:01:11.119> hair

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
have blue eyes and people have dark hair

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.730 
have blue eyes and people have dark hair
tend<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.750> have<00:01:11.840> brown<00:01:12.020> eyes<00:01:12.079> because<00:01:12.530> those

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
tend to have brown eyes because those

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.670 
tend to have brown eyes because those
two<00:01:12.950> traits<00:01:13.219> are<00:01:13.520> probably<00:01:14.240> linked<00:01:14.450> together

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
two traits are probably linked together

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.200 
two traits are probably linked together
so<00:01:15.680> we're<00:01:15.799> gonna<00:01:15.890> go<00:01:16.100> ahead<00:01:16.219> and<00:01:16.520> show<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.939> how

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
so we're gonna go ahead and show you how

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.060 
so we're gonna go ahead and show you how
to<00:01:17.420> do<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.659> test<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:18.560> whether<00:01:18.710> or<00:01:18.829> not<00:01:18.920> this

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
to do a test to see whether or not this

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.649 
to do a test to see whether or not this
is<00:01:19.250> true<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.270> would<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.479> null

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
is true now what would the null

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.330 
is true now what would the null
hypothesis<00:01:21.469> be<00:01:21.680> now<00:01:22.039> there's<00:01:22.189> two

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
hypothesis be now there's two

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.850 
hypothesis be now there's two
possibilities<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.210> could<00:01:23.420> say<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:23.930> believe

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
possibilities you could say I believe

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.580 
possibilities you could say I believe
that<00:01:25.130> two<00:01:25.340> genes<00:01:25.700> are<00:01:26.119> linked<00:01:26.600> but<00:01:27.140> if<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:27.350> say

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
that two genes are linked but if you say

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.950 
that two genes are linked but if you say
that<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.250> really<00:01:28.369> can't<00:01:28.820> calculate<00:01:29.750> where

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
that you really can't calculate where

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.020 
that you really can't calculate where
your<00:01:30.259> expected<00:01:30.710> numbers<00:01:31.070> are<00:01:31.250> because<00:01:31.880> we

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
your expected numbers are because we

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.760 
your expected numbers are because we
don't<00:01:32.180> know<00:01:32.329> how<00:01:32.479> tightly<00:01:32.930> those<00:01:33.320> two<00:01:33.530> genes

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
don't know how tightly those two genes

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.069 
don't know how tightly those two genes
are<00:01:34.039> linked<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.210> only<00:01:35.450> way<00:01:35.539> we<00:01:35.659> can<00:01:35.780> do<00:01:35.930> it

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
are linked so the only way we can do it

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.020 
are linked so the only way we can do it
is<00:01:36.200> by<00:01:36.380> going<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.920> other<00:01:36.950> way<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.280> believe<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
is by going the other way I believe the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.139 
is by going the other way I believe the
genes<00:01:38.920> independently<00:01:39.920> assort<00:01:40.280> according<00:01:41.030> to

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
genes independently assort according to

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.450 
genes independently assort according to
Mendel<00:01:41.479> because<00:01:41.869> then<00:01:42.500> our<00:01:42.530> ratios<00:01:43.219> of<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
Mendel because then our ratios of the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.840 
Mendel because then our ratios of the
phenotypes<00:01:43.909> would<00:01:44.180> be<00:01:44.329> one<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.950> one<00:01:45.979> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
phenotypes would be one to one to one to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.450 
phenotypes would be one to one to one to
one<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:47.689> would<00:01:47.899> see<00:01:48.079> all<00:01:48.320> four<00:01:48.649> phenotypes<00:01:49.189> in

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
one we would see all four phenotypes in

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.789 
one we would see all four phenotypes in
equal<00:01:49.909> numbers<00:01:50.560> okay

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
equal numbers okay

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.310 
equal numbers okay
well<00:01:52.250> let's<00:01:52.429> go<00:01:52.579> ahead<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.939> try<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.810> genes<00:01:54.079> for

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
well let's go ahead and try to genes for

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.469 
well let's go ahead and try to genes for
hair<00:01:54.469> color<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:54.829> eye<00:01:54.950> color<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.609> to<00:01:56.299> make

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
hair color and eye color and to make

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.840 
hair color and eye color and to make
things<00:01:56.780> very<00:01:56.899> easy<00:01:57.350> we're<00:01:58.070> gonna<00:01:58.280> say<00:01:58.579> it's<00:01:58.759> an

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
things very easy we're gonna say it's an

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.179 
things very easy we're gonna say it's an
either/or<00:01:59.320> one<00:02:00.320> or<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.500> other<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:00.920> got<00:02:01.100> to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
either/or one or the other so you got to

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.039 
either/or one or the other so you got to
have<00:02:01.310> dark<00:02:01.609> hair<00:02:01.670> or<00:02:02.090> light<00:02:02.359> hair<00:02:02.630> we're<00:02:02.929> not

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
have dark hair or light hair we're not

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.929 
have dark hair or light hair we're not
gonna<00:02:03.200> go<00:02:03.409> red<00:02:03.710> hair<00:02:04.039> or<00:02:04.070> I'm<00:02:04.310> gonna<00:02:04.429> go<00:02:04.579> gray

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
gonna go red hair or I'm gonna go gray

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.450 
gonna go red hair or I'm gonna go gray
hair<00:02:05.270> things<00:02:05.570> like<00:02:05.749> that<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.289> for<00:02:06.979> eyes<00:02:07.100> we're

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
hair things like that and for eyes we're

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.219 
hair things like that and for eyes we're
also<00:02:07.609> not<00:02:07.969> gonna<00:02:08.179> do<00:02:08.300> green<00:02:08.570> eyes<00:02:08.780> we're<00:02:09.050> just

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
also not gonna do green eyes we're just

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.290 
also not gonna do green eyes we're just
gonna<00:02:09.380> say<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.310> dark<00:02:10.580> eyes<00:02:10.789> or<00:02:11.090> light

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
gonna say you have dark eyes or light

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.110 
gonna say you have dark eyes or light
eyes<00:02:11.770> well<00:02:12.770> light<00:02:13.040> would<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.340> blue<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:13.790> we're

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
eyes well light would be blue but we're

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.509 
eyes well light would be blue but we're
just<00:02:14.150> gonna<00:02:14.360> keep<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.750> simple<00:02:15.170> okay<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:16.129> let's

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
just gonna keep it simple okay so let's

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.220 
just gonna keep it simple okay so let's
go<00:02:16.670> ahead<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.970> suppose<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.720> walked<00:02:17.959> into<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
go ahead and suppose I walked into a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.490 
go ahead and suppose I walked into a
class

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
class

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.890 
class
and<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:19.070> asked<00:02:19.430> people<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.940> those<00:02:20.570> four

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
and I just asked people of those four

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.200 
and I just asked people of those four
phenotypes<00:02:21.530> there<00:02:21.860> right<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.550> here's<00:02:23.090> our

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
phenotypes there right so here's our

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.910 
phenotypes there right so here's our
four<00:02:23.510> phenotypes<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.350> which<00:02:24.590> one<00:02:24.800> are<00:02:24.830> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
four phenotypes right which one are you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.730 
four phenotypes right which one are you
so<00:02:25.490> how<00:02:25.670> many<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.090> are<00:02:26.540> dark<00:02:27.230> hair<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
so how many of you are dark hair and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.840 
so how many of you are dark hair and
dark<00:02:27.890> eyes<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.220> 40<00:02:28.970> people<00:02:29.150> would<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:30.440> are

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
dark eyes and 40 people would say we are

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.640 
dark eyes and 40 people would say we are
so<00:02:31.850> we<00:02:32.030> go<00:02:32.210> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.450> only<00:02:32.690> answer<00:02:32.870> once<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.560> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
so we go you can only answer once to the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.860 
so we go you can only answer once to the
question<00:02:34.040> right<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.270> make<00:02:35.420> things<00:02:35.600> even

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
question right and to make things even

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.680 
question right and to make things even
easier<00:02:36.110> let's<00:02:36.560> suppose<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.240> surveyed<00:02:38.240> 100

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
easier let's suppose that I surveyed 100

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.800 
easier let's suppose that I surveyed 100
people<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.520> was<00:02:40.790> my<00:02:41.000> observed<00:02:41.510> data

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
people and this was my observed data

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.880 
people and this was my observed data
that<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.410> got<00:02:42.820> okay<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.480> far<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:44.900> good<00:02:45.050> right<00:02:45.110> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
that I got okay so far so good right and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.410 
that I got okay so far so good right and
the<00:02:45.950> question<00:02:46.370> though<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.700> how<00:02:47.030> do<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.180> go

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
the question though is how do we go

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.180 
the question though is how do we go
ahead<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.990> figure<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.770> expected

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
ahead and figure out what the expected

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.910 
ahead and figure out what the expected
data<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.910> now<00:02:50.540> remember<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:51.170> tricky<00:02:51.560> all

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
data is now remember it's tricky all

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920 
data is now remember it's tricky all
hundred<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.580> those<00:02:52.700> people<00:02:53.090> pretty<00:02:53.390> much<00:02:53.480> came

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
hundred of those people pretty much came

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.320 
hundred of those people pretty much came
from<00:02:54.620> different<00:02:54.830> parents<00:02:55.430> different<00:02:55.640> crosses

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
from different parents different crosses

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.620 
from different parents different crosses
so<00:02:56.840> there<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.140> no<00:02:57.410> one<00:02:57.830> set<00:02:58.220> ratio<00:02:58.790> we<00:02:59.360> can't

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
so there is no one set ratio we can't

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.240 
so there is no one set ratio we can't
tell<00:02:59.959> whether<00:03:00.230> they<00:03:00.440> came<00:03:00.709> from<00:03:00.980> a

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
tell whether they came from a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.240 
tell whether they came from a
heterozygous<00:03:02.000> cross<00:03:02.480> or<00:03:02.840> homozygous<00:03:03.290> cross

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
heterozygous cross or homozygous cross

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.270 
heterozygous cross or homozygous cross
or<00:03:04.520> whatever<00:03:04.940> all<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:06.020> can<00:03:06.200> do<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.130> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
or whatever all we can do is what is the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.090 
or whatever all we can do is what is the
frequency<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.540> trait<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.140> population

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
frequency of the trait in the population

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.370 
frequency of the trait in the population
so<00:03:10.760> here's<00:03:10.970> how<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.480> take<00:03:12.140> those

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
so here's how you do it take those

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.530 
so here's how you do it take those
numbers<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:12.980> start<00:03:13.280> crunching<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.850> and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
numbers and you start crunching it and

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.210 
numbers and you start crunching it and
the<00:03:14.720> first<00:03:14.930> thing<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.200> do<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.590> break<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.100> up

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the first thing I do is I break it up

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.310 
the first thing I do is I break it up
and<00:03:16.400> look<00:03:16.940> at<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.150> probability<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.050> each

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and look at the probability of each

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.040 
and look at the probability of each
individual<00:03:19.250> trait<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.390> let's<00:03:20.600> look<00:03:20.690> at<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> hair

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
individual trait so let's look at a hair

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.820 
individual trait so let's look at a hair
color<00:03:21.260> first

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
color first

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.509 
color first
dark<00:03:22.519> hair<00:03:23.180> or<00:03:23.480> light<00:03:23.810> hair<00:03:24.140> right<00:03:24.440> well<00:03:25.250> dark

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
dark hair or light hair right well dark

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.880 
dark hair or light hair right well dark
hair<00:03:25.730> who<00:03:25.940> had<00:03:26.120> dark<00:03:26.420> hair<00:03:26.620> well<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.709> people

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
hair who had dark hair well the people

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.250 
hair who had dark hair well the people
at<00:03:28.100> dark<00:03:28.370> hair<00:03:28.580> were<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.820> ones<00:03:29.030> 40<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.140> them

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
at dark hair were the ones 40 of them

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.030 
at dark hair were the ones 40 of them
had<00:03:30.470> dark<00:03:30.769> hair<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.250> dark<00:03:31.310> eyes<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.890> 20<00:03:33.890> of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
had dark hair and dark eyes and 20 of

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.820 
had dark hair and dark eyes and 20 of
them<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:34.610> had<00:03:35.269> dark<00:03:35.690> hair<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.290> light<00:03:36.650> eyes

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
them right had dark hair and light eyes

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.920 
them right had dark hair and light eyes
and<00:03:37.130> we<00:03:37.250> don't<00:03:37.400> care<00:03:37.610> about<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.970> eyes<00:03:38.060> we<00:03:38.600> just

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
and we don't care about the eyes we just

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.509 
and we don't care about the eyes we just
want<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.320> know<00:03:39.350> how<00:03:39.680> many<00:03:39.739> people<00:03:39.890> had<00:03:40.220> dark

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
want to know how many people had dark

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.690 
want to know how many people had dark
hair<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:41.510> would<00:03:41.630> be<00:03:41.810> 60<00:03:42.350> people<00:03:42.640> how<00:03:43.640> many

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
hair that would be 60 people how many

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.520 
hair that would be 60 people how many
people<00:03:44.150> out<00:03:44.239> of<00:03:44.299> 100<00:03:44.540> therefore<00:03:45.140> had<00:03:45.290> light

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
people out of 100 therefore had light

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.940 
people out of 100 therefore had light
hair<00:03:45.700> would<00:03:46.700> be<00:03:46.910> 40<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:48.049> these<00:03:48.260> two<00:03:48.560> numbers

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
hair would be 40 so these two numbers

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.600 
hair would be 40 so these two numbers
had<00:03:49.220> to<00:03:49.400> add<00:03:49.549> up<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:50.110> 100<00:03:51.110> right<00:03:51.350> we<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:52.459> look

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
had to add up to 100 right we then look

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.490 
had to add up to 100 right we then look
at<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.820> data<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.269> do<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.570> same<00:03:53.780> thing<00:03:54.170> for

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
at the data and do the same thing for

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.740 
at the data and do the same thing for
eyes<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.700> let's<00:03:55.880> go<00:03:56.060> back<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.420> look<00:03:56.570> at<00:03:56.660> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
eyes so let's go back and look at the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.800 
eyes so let's go back and look at the
eyes<00:03:56.870> again<00:03:57.579> eyes<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:59.150> had<00:03:59.360> 15<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.560> them<00:04:00.890> had

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
eyes again eyes you had 15 of them had

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.259 
eyes again eyes you had 15 of them had
excuse<00:04:02.810> me<00:04:02.959> 20<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> them<00:04:04.010> had<00:04:04.310> light<00:04:04.610> eyes<00:04:04.850> and

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
excuse me 20 of them had light eyes and

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.110 
excuse me 20 of them had light eyes and
25<00:04:06.019> of<00:04:06.049> them<00:04:06.320> had<00:04:06.500> light<00:04:06.709> eyes<00:04:06.890> here<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.940> that

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
25 of them had light eyes here so that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.100 
25 of them had light eyes here so that
would<00:04:08.239> give<00:04:08.420> us<00:04:08.450> 45<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.970> there's<00:04:10.970> our<00:04:11.180> 45<00:04:11.750> and

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
would give us 45 and there's our 45 and

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.780 
would give us 45 and there's our 45 and
then<00:04:12.620> how<00:04:12.829> many<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.250> hundred<00:04:13.549> would<00:04:13.670> have

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
then how many of the hundred would have

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.420 
then how many of the hundred would have
dark<00:04:14.090> eyes<00:04:14.299> would<00:04:14.870> be<00:04:14.900> 55<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.040> once<00:04:16.190> again

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
dark eyes would be 55 and once again

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.069 
dark eyes would be 55 and once again
they<00:04:17.390> add<00:04:17.690> up<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:18.609> 100<00:04:19.609> simple<00:04:20.540> enough<00:04:20.780> right

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
they add up to 100 simple enough right

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.930 
they add up to 100 simple enough right
so<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.490> crunch<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:23.830> two<00:04:24.830> gene<00:04:25.070> phenotypes<00:04:25.640> to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
so you crunch the two gene phenotypes to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.050 
so you crunch the two gene phenotypes to
get<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.660> one<00:04:27.050> gene<00:04:27.289> analysis<00:04:27.919> then<00:04:28.849> you<00:04:28.880> go

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
get a one gene analysis then you go

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.119 
get a one gene analysis then you go
ahead<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.450> convert<00:04:29.599> those<00:04:30.080> numbers<00:04:30.590> in

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
ahead and convert those numbers in

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.699 
ahead and convert those numbers in
to<00:04:31.279> percentages<00:04:32.119> pretty<00:04:32.629> easy<00:04:32.839> now<00:04:33.499> in<00:04:33.619> this

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:33.709 
to percentages pretty easy now in this

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.619 
to percentages pretty easy now in this
case<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:34.159> cheated<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.729> little<00:04:34.759> bit<00:04:35.059> I<00:04:35.300> said<00:04:35.539> it

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
case I cheated a little bit I said it

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.600 
case I cheated a little bit I said it
was<00:04:35.749> 100<00:04:36.409> you<00:04:36.949> might<00:04:37.189> have<00:04:37.309> had<00:04:37.459> a<00:04:37.489> different

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
was 100 you might have had a different

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.299 
was 100 you might have had a different
number<00:04:38.059> you<00:04:38.330> may<00:04:38.449> have<00:04:38.569> had<00:04:38.979> 257<00:04:39.979> for<00:04:40.159> all<00:04:40.219> I

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:40.309 
number you may have had 257 for all I

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.549 
number you may have had 257 for all I
know<00:04:40.489> but<00:04:40.879> you<00:04:41.509> take<00:04:41.689> the<00:04:41.929> number<00:04:42.229> of<00:04:42.289> people

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:42.559 
know but you take the number of people

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.939 
know but you take the number of people
had<00:04:42.739> dark<00:04:43.039> hair<00:04:43.099> which<00:04:43.519> I<00:04:43.699> said<00:04:43.939> was<00:04:44.119> 60

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
had dark hair which I said was 60

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.459 
had dark hair which I said was 60
divided<00:04:45.949> by<00:04:46.129> the<00:04:46.189> 100<00:04:46.879> and<00:04:46.999> that<00:04:47.179> tells<00:04:47.509> me<00:04:47.749> the

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
divided by the 100 and that tells me the

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.679 
divided by the 100 and that tells me the
probability<00:04:49.339> of<00:04:49.399> the<00:04:49.580> population<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.419> having

00:04:50.679 --> 00:04:50.689 
probability of the population of having

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.790 
probability of the population of having
dark<00:04:50.929> hair<00:04:51.019> is<00:04:51.849> 60%<00:04:52.849> and<00:04:53.119> I<00:04:53.779> do<00:04:53.839> the<00:04:54.110> same<00:04:54.319> for

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
dark hair is 60% and I do the same for

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.649 
dark hair is 60% and I do the same for
all<00:04:55.069> four<00:04:55.099> of<00:04:55.669> them<00:04:55.909> now<00:04:56.029> you<00:04:56.059> will<00:04:56.419> notice

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
all four of them now you will notice

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.100 
all four of them now you will notice
once<00:04:57.589> again<00:04:57.739> that<00:04:57.979> each<00:04:58.519> pair<00:04:58.939> has<00:04:59.539> to<00:04:59.809> head<00:04:59.959> up

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
once again that each pair has to head up

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.989 
once again that each pair has to head up
to<00:05:00.139> a<00:05:00.319> hundred<00:05:00.619> percent<00:05:00.709> either<00:05:01.459> have<00:05:01.729> dark

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:01.999 
to a hundred percent either have dark

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.079 
to a hundred percent either have dark
hair<00:05:02.089> light<00:05:02.509> hair<00:05:02.779> so<00:05:03.309> those<00:05:04.309> two<00:05:04.610> have<00:05:04.909> to<00:05:05.059> add

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:05.089 
hair light hair so those two have to add

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.109 
hair light hair so those two have to add
up<00:05:05.360> to<00:05:05.389> one<00:05:05.899> hundred<00:05:06.080> percent<00:05:06.349> or<00:05:06.709> one<00:05:07.249> same

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:08.119 
up to one hundred percent or one same

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:10.480 
up to one hundred percent or one same
thing<00:05:08.360> with<00:05:08.479> dark<00:05:08.749> eyes<00:05:08.959> or<00:05:09.199> light<00:05:09.409> eyes<00:05:09.589> 55

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
thing with dark eyes or light eyes 55

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.949 
thing with dark eyes or light eyes 55
and<00:05:10.699> forty<00:05:10.939> five<00:05:11.059> ants<00:05:11.449> up<00:05:11.659> to<00:05:11.899> one<00:05:12.860> or<00:05:13.159> 100%

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:13.959 
and forty five ants up to one or 100%

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.589 
and forty five ants up to one or 100%
can<00:05:14.959> only<00:05:15.110> have<00:05:15.319> one<00:05:15.499> or<00:05:15.529> the<00:05:15.709> other<00:05:15.999> okay<00:05:16.999> so

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
can only have one or the other okay so

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.219 
can only have one or the other okay so
now<00:05:17.749> we<00:05:17.809> know<00:05:18.110> what<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:20.080> probability<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.169> the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
now we know what the probability to the

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.040 
now we know what the probability to the
fraction<00:05:21.769> percentages<00:05:22.369> of<00:05:22.610> having<00:05:22.939> one<00:05:23.629> trait

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
fraction percentages of having one trait

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.850 
fraction percentages of having one trait
now<00:05:24.709> here's<00:05:25.039> what<00:05:25.219> Mendel<00:05:25.669> said<00:05:25.969> very<00:05:26.329> simple

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
now here's what Mendel said very simple

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.659 
now here's what Mendel said very simple
according<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.099> second<00:05:28.490> law<00:05:28.519> of

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
according to the second law of

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.909 
according to the second law of
independent<00:05:28.879> assortment<00:05:29.329> if<00:05:29.869> one<00:05:30.199> gene<00:05:30.529> has

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
independent assortment if one gene has

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.579 
independent assortment if one gene has
nothing<00:05:31.519> to<00:05:31.550> do<00:05:31.879> with<00:05:32.119> the<00:05:32.269> other<00:05:32.479> gene<00:05:32.809> then

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:33.589 
nothing to do with the other gene then

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.189 
nothing to do with the other gene then
what<00:05:33.889> is<00:05:34.009> the<00:05:34.159> probability<00:05:34.699> of<00:05:34.939> finding<00:05:35.269> both

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
what is the probability of finding both

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.339 
what is the probability of finding both
traits<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:37.009> a<00:05:37.219> person<00:05:37.759> all<00:05:38.419> you<00:05:38.869> do<00:05:39.110> is

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
traits in a person all you do is

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.219 
traits in a person all you do is
multiply<00:05:39.619> the<00:05:40.069> numbers<00:05:40.610> so<00:05:41.329> for<00:05:41.509> example<00:05:41.959> if<00:05:42.079> I

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
multiply the numbers so for example if I

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.569 
multiply the numbers so for example if I
look<00:05:42.259> at<00:05:42.559> these<00:05:42.679> numbers<00:05:42.949> in<00:05:43.309> the<00:05:43.399> population

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:43.579 
look at these numbers in the population

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:46.600 
look at these numbers in the population
say<00:05:44.300> okay<00:05:44.740> sixty<00:05:45.740> percent<00:05:45.889> of<00:05:46.189> people<00:05:46.249> have

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
say okay sixty percent of people have

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.799 
say okay sixty percent of people have
dark<00:05:46.909> hair<00:05:46.999> and<00:05:49.089> 55<00:05:50.089> percent<00:05:50.119> of<00:05:50.599> the<00:05:50.659> people

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:50.809 
dark hair and 55 percent of the people

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.409 
dark hair and 55 percent of the people
have<00:05:51.139> dark<00:05:51.469> eyes<00:05:51.679> what<00:05:52.639> is<00:05:52.669> the<00:05:52.909> probability

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
have dark eyes what is the probability

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.419 
have dark eyes what is the probability
that<00:05:53.629> someone<00:05:53.779> will<00:05:54.259> have<00:05:54.409> both<00:05:54.679> traits<00:05:55.069> dark

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:55.429 
that someone will have both traits dark

00:05:55.429 --> 00:06:00.419 
that someone will have both traits dark
hair<00:05:55.669> and<00:05:55.789> dark<00:05:55.849> eyes<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:57.019> would<00:05:57.199> be<00:05:57.909> 0.6<00:05:58.909> times

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:00.429 
hair and dark eyes it would be 0.6 times

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:04.480 
hair and dark eyes it would be 0.6 times
0.55<00:06:01.449> it's<00:06:02.449> that<00:06:02.749> simple<00:06:03.259> that's<00:06:03.709> the<00:06:04.039> second

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
0.55 it's that simple that's the second

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.219 
0.55 it's that simple that's the second
law<00:06:04.610> I<00:06:04.999> want<00:06:05.659> to<00:06:05.749> know<00:06:05.839> what's<00:06:06.139> the

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
law I want to know what's the

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.049 
law I want to know what's the
probability<00:06:06.289> of<00:06:06.919> having<00:06:07.069> light<00:06:07.490> hair<00:06:07.819> and

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:08.059 
probability of having light hair and

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.319 
probability of having light hair and
dark<00:06:08.659> eyes<00:06:08.929> it<00:06:09.529> would<00:06:09.709> be<00:06:09.889> point<00:06:10.279> four<00:06:10.610> times

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:11.329 
dark eyes it would be point four times

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:14.949 
dark eyes it would be point four times
0.55<00:06:12.319> and<00:06:12.589> all<00:06:13.369> the<00:06:13.639> combinations<00:06:14.419> to<00:06:14.599> give<00:06:14.779> me

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:14.959 
0.55 and all the combinations to give me

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:17.109 
0.55 and all the combinations to give me
the<00:06:15.139> four<00:06:15.409> possibilities<00:06:16.129> let's<00:06:16.879> go<00:06:17.029> ahead

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:17.119 
the four possibilities let's go ahead

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.230 
the four possibilities let's go ahead
and<00:06:17.300> do<00:06:17.419> those<00:06:17.709> so<00:06:18.709> here<00:06:18.889> we<00:06:18.979> go<00:06:19.099> I<00:06:19.339> am

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
and do those so here we go I am

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.600 
and do those so here we go I am
multiplying<00:06:20.479> all<00:06:21.169> four<00:06:21.679> those<00:06:21.949> possibilities

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
multiplying all four those possibilities

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.899 
multiplying all four those possibilities
to<00:06:23.509> get<00:06:23.719> these<00:06:23.899> four<00:06:24.229> phenotypes<00:06:24.829> that<00:06:25.129> will

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
to get these four phenotypes that will

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.299 
to get these four phenotypes that will
tell<00:06:26.149> me<00:06:26.329> the<00:06:26.479> probability<00:06:27.259> of<00:06:27.289> each<00:06:27.409> one<00:06:27.679> and

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
tell me the probability of each one and

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:29.619 
tell me the probability of each one and
then<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.579> want<00:06:28.759> to<00:06:28.879> figure<00:06:29.089> out<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.419> expected

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
then I want to figure out the expected

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.449 
then I want to figure out the expected
number<00:06:30.169> of<00:06:30.349> people<00:06:30.679> who<00:06:30.769> would<00:06:30.919> have<00:06:31.159> those

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459 
number of people who would have those

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:34.629 
number of people who would have those
traits<00:06:32.089> I<00:06:32.449> multiply<00:06:33.409> by<00:06:33.679> my<00:06:33.889> sampling<00:06:34.339> size

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
traits I multiply by my sampling size

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.290 
traits I multiply by my sampling size
which<00:06:35.449> in<00:06:35.629> this<00:06:35.779> case<00:06:36.050> was<00:06:36.469> 100<00:06:37.459> and<00:06:37.579> that

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
which in this case was 100 and that

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.219 
which in this case was 100 and that
gives<00:06:38.629> me<00:06:38.869> the<00:06:39.649> number<00:06:40.039> of<00:06:40.159> people<00:06:40.519> I<00:06:40.610> expect

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
gives me the number of people I expect

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.980 
gives me the number of people I expect
based<00:06:42.229> on<00:06:42.559> the<00:06:43.099> observe

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
based on the observe

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.520 
based on the observe
data<00:06:44.170> to<00:06:44.830> have<00:06:45.070> those<00:06:45.730> traits<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:46.600> once<00:06:47.230> again

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
data to have those traits and once again

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.480 
data to have those traits and once again
those<00:06:48.100> numbers<00:06:48.580> all<00:06:48.850> add<00:06:48.880> up<00:06:49.210> to<00:06:49.590> 100<00:06:50.590> so<00:06:51.310> now<00:06:51.460> I

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
those numbers all add up to 100 so now I

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.060 
those numbers all add up to 100 so now I
have<00:06:51.820> both<00:06:52.060> my<00:06:52.120> observed<00:06:52.720> data<00:06:52.990> and<00:06:53.290> my

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
have both my observed data and my

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.370 
have both my observed data and my
expected<00:06:54.730> data<00:06:54.940> now<00:06:55.840> we're<00:06:56.020> going<00:06:56.140> to<00:06:56.200> go

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
expected data now we're going to go

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.780 
expected data now we're going to go
ahead<00:06:56.470> and<00:06:56.800> plug<00:06:56.980> these<00:06:57.190> in<00:06:57.400> and<00:06:57.580> do<00:06:57.670> the

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
ahead and plug these in and do the

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.390 
ahead and plug these in and do the
chi-square<00:06:58.300> analysis<00:06:58.710> so<00:06:59.710> here's<00:06:59.920> my<00:07:00.100> 4

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
chi-square analysis so here's my 4

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.610 
chi-square analysis so here's my 4
phenotypes<00:07:00.940> once<00:07:01.330> again<00:07:01.660> degree<00:07:02.050> of<00:07:02.200> freedom

in<00:07:02.770> this<00:07:02.890> particular<00:07:03.250> case<00:07:03.700> would<00:07:04.450> be<00:07:04.650> 3<00:07:05.910> okay

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
in this particular case would be 3 okay

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.260 
in this particular case would be 3 okay
this<00:07:07.720> was<00:07:07.930> my<00:07:08.110> observed<00:07:08.470> data<00:07:08.740> based<00:07:09.730> on<00:07:10.030> my

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
this was my observed data based on my

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.380 
this was my observed data based on my
one<00:07:10.600> gene<00:07:10.870> analysis<00:07:11.560> these<00:07:12.280> are<00:07:12.550> my<00:07:12.700> expected

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
one gene analysis these are my expected

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.020 
one gene analysis these are my expected
numbers<00:07:13.810> I<00:07:14.020> went<00:07:14.830> ahead<00:07:14.920> and<00:07:15.250> just<00:07:15.460> plugged<00:07:15.850> in

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
numbers I went ahead and just plugged in

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.480 
numbers I went ahead and just plugged in
another<00:07:16.570> column<00:07:16.870> here<00:07:17.290> to<00:07:17.860> do<00:07:18.340> the

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
another column here to do the

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.330 
another column here to do the
calculations<00:07:19.270> here<00:07:19.510> are<00:07:20.350> my<00:07:20.500> numbers<00:07:20.890> add

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
calculations here are my numbers add

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.760 
calculations here are my numbers add
them<00:07:21.580> all<00:07:21.700> up<00:07:21.730> and<00:07:22.090> gives<00:07:22.570> me<00:07:22.780> a<00:07:22.810> chi-square<00:07:23.530> of

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
them all up and gives me a chi-square of

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.990 
them all up and gives me a chi-square of
10<00:07:24.040> point<00:07:24.400> o2

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
10 point o2

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.660 
10 point o2
that's<00:07:25.630> pretty<00:07:25.960> high<00:07:26.200> number<00:07:26.620> actually<00:07:26.830> you

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:27.670 
that's pretty high number actually you

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.220 
that's pretty high number actually you
can<00:07:27.850> see<00:07:28.060> that<00:07:28.090> some<00:07:28.690> of<00:07:28.720> them<00:07:28.900> are<00:07:28.960> quite

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230 
can see that some of them are quite

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.090 
can see that some of them are quite
different<00:07:29.790> 42:33<00:07:30.790> 15<00:07:31.720> to<00:07:31.780> 25<00:07:32.260> these<00:07:32.590> are<00:07:32.740> big

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
different 42:33 15 to 25 these are big

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.490 
different 42:33 15 to 25 these are big
big<00:07:33.370> differences<00:07:34.000> so<00:07:34.570> my<00:07:34.720> observed<00:07:35.080> data<00:07:35.350> and

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:35.500 
big differences so my observed data and

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.310 
big differences so my observed data and
my<00:07:35.680> expected<00:07:36.190> doesn't<00:07:36.550> match<00:07:36.700> up<00:07:36.840> 10<00:07:37.840> point<00:07:38.140> o2

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.320 
my expected doesn't match up 10 point o2

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.220 
my expected doesn't match up 10 point o2
is<00:07:38.710> my<00:07:38.860> chi-square<00:07:39.490> number<00:07:40.420> let's<00:07:40.930> go<00:07:41.110> ahead

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.230 
is my chi-square number let's go ahead

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.640 
is my chi-square number let's go ahead
and<00:07:41.410> look<00:07:41.500> at<00:07:41.680> it<00:07:41.830> a<00:07:42.250> degree<00:07:42.760> of<00:07:42.790> freedom<00:07:43.030> was

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650 
and look at it a degree of freedom was

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.530 
and look at it a degree of freedom was
3/10<00:07:44.650> is<00:07:44.890> gonna<00:07:45.100> be<00:07:45.280> a<00:07:45.310> way<00:07:45.640> off<00:07:46.210> here

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:46.540 
3/10 is gonna be a way off here

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.310 
3/10 is gonna be a way off here
somewhere<00:07:47.140> this<00:07:47.770> is<00:07:47.950> 5%<00:07:48.910> so<00:07:49.570> the<00:07:49.660> likelihood

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320 
somewhere this is 5% so the likelihood

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.460 
somewhere this is 5% so the likelihood
of<00:07:50.350> my<00:07:50.680> hypothesis<00:07:51.610> being<00:07:51.850> true<00:07:51.940> is<00:07:52.810> less<00:07:53.230> than

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.470 
of my hypothesis being true is less than

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.570 
of my hypothesis being true is less than
5%<00:07:53.850> we<00:07:54.850> reject<00:07:55.450> the<00:07:55.660> hypothesis<00:07:56.590> therefore

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:57.580 
5% we reject the hypothesis therefore

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.630 
5% we reject the hypothesis therefore
the<00:07:57.790> genes<00:07:58.090> are<00:07:58.390> not<00:07:59.020> obeying<00:07:59.710> Mendelian<00:08:00.400> laws

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:00.640 
the genes are not obeying Mendelian laws

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.640 
the genes are not obeying Mendelian laws
and<00:08:01.210> therefore<00:08:01.690> we<00:08:02.050> would<00:08:02.140> probably<00:08:02.410> assume

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:02.650 
and therefore we would probably assume
