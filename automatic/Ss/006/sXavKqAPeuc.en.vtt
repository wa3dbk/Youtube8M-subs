00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
tried to exploit some some mismatches

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.359 
tried to exploit some some mismatches
that<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.199> thought<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:25.619> had<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:25.949> offense

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that they thought they had on offense

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
that they thought they had on offense
and<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.849> weren't<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:28.109> top

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and they weren't really there and on top

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.599 
and they weren't really there and on top
of<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> they<00:00:28.710> waited<00:00:28.980> too<00:00:29.070> long<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.460> into

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
of that they waited too long to get into

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
of that they waited too long to get into
those<00:00:29.730> sets<00:00:30.060> usually<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> Celtics<00:00:31.199> they<00:00:31.260> want

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
those sets usually the Celtics they want

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.930 
those sets usually the Celtics they want
to<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:31.740> sets<00:00:32.099> early<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.550> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> run

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to get into sets early they want to run

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
to get into sets early they want to run
a<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.180> bit<00:00:33.420> play<00:00:33.870> quicker<00:00:34.230> than<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.620> did

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
a little bit play quicker than they did

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.350 
a little bit play quicker than they did
tonight<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> second<00:00:35.460> half<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.790> he<00:00:36.120> thinks

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
tonight in the second half and he thinks

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.420 
tonight in the second half and he thinks
that<00:00:36.390> that's<00:00:36.600> why<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.840> team<00:00:37.079> lagged<00:00:37.430> right

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that that's why the team lagged right

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.979 
that that's why the team lagged right
and<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> scary<00:00:39.300> points<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> night

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and one of the scary points of the night

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.780 
and one of the scary points of the night
was<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> saw<00:00:40.680> Paul<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.309> he<00:00:41.489> got<00:00:41.640> up

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
was when we saw Paul go down he got up

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
was when we saw Paul go down he got up
and<00:00:41.879> he<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.059> holding<00:00:42.360> his<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.870> he<00:00:43.410> left<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and he was holding his back he left the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.130 
and he was holding his back he left the
game<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.950> 353<00:00:44.520> left<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.360> third<00:00:45.600> we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
game with 353 left in the third we

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.760 
game with 353 left in the third we
didn't<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> happen

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
didn't know what was going to happen

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
didn't know what was going to happen
yeah<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.910> went<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.510> seemed

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
yeah when he went out it really seemed

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
yeah when he went out it really seemed
like<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.620> Miami<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.340> into<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
like that's when Miami got into the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
like that's when Miami got into the
rhythm<00:00:51.079> particularly<00:00:52.079> LeBron<00:00:52.649> James<00:00:52.949> he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
rhythm particularly LeBron James he

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
rhythm particularly LeBron James he
scored<00:00:53.370> nine<00:00:53.640> points<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.600> final<00:00:54.930> less

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
scored nine points and that final less

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.600 
scored nine points and that final less
than<00:00:55.260> four<00:00:55.500> minutes<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> third

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
than four minutes of the of the third

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.340 
than four minutes of the of the third
quarter<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> momentum

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
quarter and that really got the momentum

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.529 
quarter and that really got the momentum
on<00:00:58.649> Miami's<00:00:59.039> side<00:00:59.250> they<00:00:59.760> wound<00:01:00.000> up<00:01:00.120> cutting<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
on Miami's side they wound up cutting it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.660 
on Miami's side they wound up cutting it
down<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> three<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.710> fourth<00:01:01.920> quarter<00:01:02.129> with

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
down to three in the fourth quarter with

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.789 
down to three in the fourth quarter with
that<00:01:02.850> momentum<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.840> guess<00:01:04.290> we'll<00:01:04.439> talk<00:01:04.589> now

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that momentum and I guess we'll talk now

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
that momentum and I guess we'll talk now
about<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:05.129> happened<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.489> Ray<00:01:06.240> Ray<00:01:06.630> had<00:01:06.780> a
