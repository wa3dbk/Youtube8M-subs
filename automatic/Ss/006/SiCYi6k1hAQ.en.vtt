 ragga and hip hop 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:03.510

 go use the chest especially the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:30.090
 lumbar inspired open the strands 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:33.510

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.890
 comfortable to add a little foot to 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.890
 right and left 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.899
 it's going well with reggaeton music 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.659
 very strong and very dynamic 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.430
