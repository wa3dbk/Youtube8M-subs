my<00:02:33.200> stencil<00:02:33.859> and<00:02:34.129> as<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.629> said<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> want<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.290> limit

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
my stencil and as I said I want to limit

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.280 
my stencil and as I said I want to limit
myself<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.579> them<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.209> amount<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.750> product

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
myself to them the amount of product

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.839 
myself to them the amount of product
that<00:02:39.410> I'm<00:02:39.530> using<00:02:39.739> on<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.190> tag<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.700> what<00:02:40.819> I

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
that I'm using on this tag and what I

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.640 
that I'm using on this tag and what I
like<00:02:41.150> about<00:02:41.329> this<00:02:41.660> stencil<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.620> one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
like about this stencil is that on one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.759 
like about this stencil is that on one
stem<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.239> lot<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.480> designs<00:02:44.930> which

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
stem so you have a lot of designs which

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.220 
stem so you have a lot of designs which
are<00:02:45.799> very<00:02:46.400> fun<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.880> use<00:02:46.910> if<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.630> like<00:02:47.840> art

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.809 
journaling so I'm dabbing the gesso over
the<00:02:54.560> stencil<00:02:54.769> just<00:02:55.010> using<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.819> sponge<00:02:58.810> and

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
the stencil just using a sponge and

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.670 
the stencil just using a sponge and
playing<00:03:01.819> around<00:03:02.060> with<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.389> different

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
playing around with the different

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
playing around with the different
designs<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.010> have<00:03:04.340> honest<00:03:04.880> answer

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.350 

now<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.989> decided<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:10.099> go<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:10.400> white<00:03:10.910> but

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
now I decided to just go with white but

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.150 
now I decided to just go with white but

if you have any ink or acrylic paint you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.300 
if you have any ink or acrylic paint you
could<00:03:16.670> use<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.150> or<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.780> could<00:03:17.930> use<00:03:18.140> your<00:03:18.379> ink

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
could use that or you could use your ink

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.030 
could use that or you could use your ink
to<00:03:19.640> colorize<00:03:20.060> your<00:03:20.180> Jessel<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.769> don't

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
to colorize your Jessel so you don't

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.750 
to colorize your Jessel so you don't
need<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.430> buy<00:03:23.140> 30,000<00:03:24.140> products<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.459> fun

need to buy 30,000 products to have fun
and<00:03:26.000> enjoy<00:03:26.090> yourself<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.780> mixed-media

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.540 

I<00:03:35.030> added<00:03:35.900> some<00:03:36.200> water<00:03:36.380> too<00:03:36.740> much<00:03:36.920> uh<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.310> so

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
I added some water too much uh so so

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.190 
I added some water too much uh so so
that<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.820> can<00:03:38.030> splatter<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.660> around<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:41.200> then

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
that I can splatter it around and then

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.650 
that I can splatter it around and then
again<00:03:42.470> trying<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:45.820> now<00:03:46.820> I'm<00:03:46.970> using<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.420> chest

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
again trying it now I'm using the chest

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.090 
again trying it now I'm using the chest
so<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:48.200> add<00:03:48.410> an<00:03:48.800> edge<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:50.450> tag<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:51.680> I'm<00:03:51.770> just

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
so to add an edge to the tag so I'm just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.690 
so to add an edge to the tag so I'm just
wiping<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.840> edges<00:03:54.170> of<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.380> textured

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
wiping the the edges of the textured

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:04.660 
wiping the the edges of the textured
Jessel<00:04:02.560> if<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.680> don't<00:04:03.860> have<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:04.250> kind<00:04:04.310> of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
Jessel if you don't have this kind of

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.530 
Jessel if you don't have this kind of
punch<00:04:04.940> you<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.300> just<00:04:05.510> use<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> perforator<00:04:06.470> and

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
punch you can just use a perforator and

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.220 
punch you can just use a perforator and
then<00:04:08.540> again<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:09.080> decide<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.860> add<00:04:10.160> some<00:04:10.940> more

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
then again I decide to add some more

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.260 
then again I decide to add some more
stenciling<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.440> want<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.700> repeated

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
stenciling I want to have a repeated

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.289 
stenciling I want to have a repeated
pattern<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.870> my<00:04:14.900> paper<00:04:15.410> so<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.640> chose<00:04:17.030> one<00:04:17.269> of

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
pattern on my paper so I chose one of

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.380 
pattern on my paper so I chose one of
the<00:04:17.480> designs<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.170> stencil<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:19.390> I'm

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
the designs on the stencil and I'm

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.370 
the designs on the stencil and I'm
adding<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:20.959> I'm<00:04:21.080> adding<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.530> three<00:04:21.769> times<00:04:22.040> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
adding and I'm adding it three times to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.220 
adding and I'm adding it three times to
obtain<00:04:24.380> my<00:04:24.740> repeated<00:04:25.130> pattern<00:04:25.720> now<00:04:26.720> this<00:04:26.750> is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
obtain my repeated pattern now this is

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.740 
obtain my repeated pattern now this is
the<00:04:27.440> second<00:04:27.919> product<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.180> I'm<00:04:29.450> allowing

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the second product and I'm allowing

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.370 
the second product and I'm allowing
myself<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.800> is<00:04:30.980> archival<00:04:31.640> ink<00:04:32.380> and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
myself and this is archival ink and

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.530 
myself and this is archival ink and
again<00:04:33.620> I'm<00:04:33.740> using<00:04:33.890> a<00:04:34.310> piece<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.669> old<00:04:34.970> book<00:04:35.270> page

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
again I'm using a piece of old book page

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.590 
again I'm using a piece of old book page
to<00:04:35.930> stamp<00:04:36.290> on<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.800> I'm<00:04:37.130> allowing<00:04:37.550> myself<00:04:37.850> one

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
to stamp on so I'm allowing myself one

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.650 
to stamp on so I'm allowing myself one
stem<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.830> well<00:04:39.890> this<00:04:40.250> is<00:04:40.400> one<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.700> my<00:04:40.880> stem

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
stem as well this is one of my stem

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.650 
stem as well this is one of my stem
fatigue<00:04:41.930> stems<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.550> added<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.060> tiny<00:04:44.330> bit<00:04:44.540> of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
fatigue stems so I added a tiny bit of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.590 
fatigue stems so I added a tiny bit of
chest<00:04:44.930> oil<00:04:45.169> on<00:04:45.320> top<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.800> paper<00:04:46.300> to<00:04:47.300> make

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
chest oil on top of the paper to make

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.760 
chest oil on top of the paper to make
the<00:04:47.840> fibers<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.970> old<00:04:50.300> paper<00:04:50.630> pop<00:04:51.229> up<00:04:51.470> just

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
the fibers of the old paper pop up just

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.390 
the fibers of the old paper pop up just
a<00:04:52.130> bit<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:53.140> now<00:04:54.140> I'm<00:04:54.320> tearing<00:04:54.710> my<00:04:54.860> paper<00:04:55.130> to

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
a bit and now I'm tearing my paper to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.280 
a bit and now I'm tearing my paper to
the<00:04:55.490> right<00:04:55.640> size<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.690> can<00:04:56.900> add<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.260> to

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
the right size so that I can add it to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:04.750 
the right size so that I can add it to
my<00:04:57.500> tag

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.070 

checking<00:05:05.760> out<00:05:05.970> where<00:05:06.210> I<00:05:06.240> want<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.960> but

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
checking out where I want to have it but

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.440 
checking out where I want to have it but
before<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.470> do<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.100> distrust<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.030> edges<00:05:09.420> a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
before I do so I distrust the edges a

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:17.510 
before I do so I distrust the edges a
bit<00:05:09.630> more<00:05:09.900> just<00:05:10.200> using<00:05:10.680> my<00:05:11.070> scissors<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:16.520> then

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
bit more just using my scissors and then
