the<00:01:39.390> pre<00:01:39.600> curve<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.320> stitching<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:41.189> really

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the pre curve this stitching is really

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.950 
the pre curve this stitching is really
here<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> second<00:01:42.390> layer<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.750> leather

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960

and kind of encapsulates the seam as it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.670 
and kind of encapsulates the seam as it
comes<00:01:45.329> around<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.990> way<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> finished

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to it moving down towards the cuff see

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
to it moving down towards the cuff see
it's<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> single<00:01:53.520> cuff<00:01:53.880> pull<00:01:54.119> along<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> bottom

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's a single cuff pull along the bottom

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.480 
it's a single cuff pull along the bottom
to<00:01:55.020> keep<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> way<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.250> as<00:01:56.340> we

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
to keep you out of the way and as we

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.010 
to keep you out of the way and as we
move<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.790> back<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> hand<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.570> gets<00:01:57.899> a

little born gnarly a little more

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.130 
little born gnarly a little more
aggressive<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.780> big

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
aggressive so we have this big

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
aggressive so we have this big
