this<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:03.510> material<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.680> cloth<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I like using this cloth like material

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.660 
I like using this cloth like material
simply<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> hand

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
simply because you can use a hand

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.660 
simply because you can use a hand
steamer<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.750> most<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.430> divots<00:01:14.430> and

work<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.659> tried<00:01:18.659> using<00:01:19.040> vinyl<00:01:20.040> material<00:01:20.280> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
work I tried using vinyl material this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.620 
work I tried using vinyl material this
is<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.549> vinyl<00:01:23.850> material<00:01:24.210> used<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
is just the the vinyl material used to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
is just the the vinyl material used to
block<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.680> light<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.280> windows<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.689> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
block out light from windows and I don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.359 
block out light from windows and I don't
like<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.320> whenever<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:28.920> driving

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
like it whenever you're driving

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
like it whenever you're driving
underneath<00:01:29.820> whatever<00:01:30.270> object<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.079> you're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
underneath whatever object it is you're

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.640 
underneath whatever object it is you're
photographing<00:01:31.439> simply<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.650> creases

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
photographing simply because the creases

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590 
photographing simply because the creases
and<00:01:34.860> divots<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.030> hard<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and divots are really hard to get out of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.770 
and divots are really hard to get out of
this<00:01:36.840> using<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.960> steamer<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:41.030> any<00:01:42.030> divots<00:01:42.600> are

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this using the steamer so any divots are

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.719 
this using the steamer so any divots are
close<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> pot<00:01:43.500> Shore<00:01:43.829> really<00:01:44.340> badly

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
close to the pot Shore really badly

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.780 
close to the pot Shore really badly
whenever<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> photograph<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.710> let's<00:01:47.340> say<00:01:47.520> if

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
whenever you photograph but let's say if

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
whenever you photograph but let's say if
you're<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> photograph<00:01:48.770> Sun<00:01:49.770> an

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you're just going to photograph Sun an

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.690 
you're just going to photograph Sun an
object<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.729> few<00:01:50.970> feet<00:01:51.180> away<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
object that's a few feet away from the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700 
object that's a few feet away from the
backdrop<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> then<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.049> vinyl<00:01:55.259> material<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
backdrop and then this vinyl material is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
backdrop and then this vinyl material is
just<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.100> straight<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.520> floor<00:01:56.670> it'd<00:01:57.210> be

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
just going straight to the floor it'd be

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.789 
just going straight to the floor it'd be
fine<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.229> set<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.500> f-stop

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
fine because you could set your f-stop

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.179 
fine because you could set your f-stop
or<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> low<00:01:59.460> blur<00:01:59.969> most<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.189> imperfections

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
or a low blur most of the imperfections

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
or a low blur most of the imperfections
in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> vinyl<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> way<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.259> stuff<00:02:04.469> will

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
in the vinyl that way so this stuff will

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
in the vinyl that way so this stuff will
get<00:02:04.740> used<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.270> situation<00:02:06.899> here

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
get used just not in this situation here

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.390 
get used just not in this situation here
so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.429> these<00:02:09.270> sheets<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:10.500> both<00:02:10.739> sides<00:02:11.009> in

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so I have these sheets on both sides in

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.200 
so I have these sheets on both sides in
between<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.180> lights

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
between the lights

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.980 
between the lights
and<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.630> piece<00:02:14.380> pottery<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.520> help<00:02:15.910> diffuse<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
and I piece pottery to help diffuse the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.650 
and I piece pottery to help diffuse the
light<00:02:17.680> even<00:02:18.280> though<00:02:18.400> these<00:02:18.760> are<00:02:18.940> soft<00:02:19.180> boxes

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
light even though these are soft boxes

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.920 
light even though these are soft boxes
and<00:02:19.930> they<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.380> pretty<00:02:20.470> good<00:02:20.770> job<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and they do a pretty good job of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and they do a pretty good job of
diffusing<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.960> light<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.470> kind<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.800> see

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
diffusing the light you can kind of see

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.280 
diffusing the light you can kind of see
how<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.160> wraps<00:02:25.030> around<00:02:25.210> my<00:02:25.450> hand<00:02:25.690> pretty<00:02:26.020> well

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
how it wraps around my hand pretty well

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.290 
how it wraps around my hand pretty well
without<00:02:26.830> too<00:02:27.640> much<00:02:27.790> hard<00:02:28.210> shadows<00:02:30.300> with

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
without too much hard shadows with

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.440 
without too much hard shadows with
pottery<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> has<00:02:32.680> high<00:02:32.950> gloss<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.240> still

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pottery that has high gloss it can still

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.780 
pottery that has high gloss it can still
give<00:02:34.840> really<00:02:35.170> harsh<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.740> highlights<00:02:36.610> on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
give really harsh out of highlights on

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.440 
give really harsh out of highlights on
this<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.780> let's<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.290> ahead<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.180> turn<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.330> up

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
this so let's go ahead and turn this up

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.640 
this so let's go ahead and turn this up
all<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.690> way<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.140> can<00:02:41.200> see<00:02:41.290> what<00:02:41.590> I'm

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
all the way so you can see what I'm

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
all the way so you can see what I'm
talking<00:02:41.980> about

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.850 

so<00:02:45.670> you'll<00:02:45.820> notice<00:02:46.060> right<00:02:46.780> around<00:02:47.020> here<00:02:47.470> we'll

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
so you'll notice right around here we'll

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.580 
so you'll notice right around here we'll
get<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.100> really<00:02:48.540> harsh<00:02:49.540> highlight<00:02:50.050> as<00:02:50.320> soon<00:02:50.470> as

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
get a really harsh highlight as soon as

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.710 
get a really harsh highlight as soon as
I<00:02:50.650> drop<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:55.630> hold<00:02:56.140> away<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:58.210> that's<00:02:58.450> with

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
I drop this hold away so that's with

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.370 
I drop this hold away so that's with
just<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.380> know<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.830> direct<00:03:00.190> softbox

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
just you know the direct softbox

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.580 
just you know the direct softbox
so<00:03:02.460> just<00:03:03.460> adding<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> sheet<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.180> between<00:03:04.590> helps

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
so just adding a sheet in between helps

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.610 
so just adding a sheet in between helps
that<00:03:05.800> light<00:03:06.130> diffuse<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.510> wrap<00:03:08.140> around<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
that light diffuse and wrap around the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.700 
that light diffuse and wrap around the
pot<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.720> hold<00:03:13.870> these<00:03:14.050> sheets<00:03:14.320> in<00:03:14.500> place

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
pot so and to hold these sheets in place

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.810 
pot so and to hold these sheets in place
I'm<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.040> using<00:03:15.460> my<00:03:16.560> trusty<00:03:17.820> Windtunnel

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
I'm just using my trusty Windtunnel

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.900 
I'm just using my trusty Windtunnel

came<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.360> all<00:03:22.510> my<00:03:22.630> lighting<00:03:22.990> stuff<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.500> just

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
came with all my lighting stuff I just

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.220 
came with all my lighting stuff I just
recently<00:03:23.890> bought<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.490> so<00:03:25.020> that's<00:03:26.020> some

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
spend a bunch of money on lights I was

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.810 
spend a bunch of money on lights I was
trying<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.420> keep<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.720> under<00:03:31.900> 200<00:03:32.470> total<00:03:32.820> you

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
trying to keep this under 200 total you

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.490 
trying to keep this under 200 total you
could<00:03:34.030> use<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.570> know<00:03:34.690> similar<00:03:34.930> setup<00:03:35.350> with

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
could use you know similar setup with

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.280 
could use you know similar setup with
just<00:03:35.740> whatever<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.100> have<00:03:36.220> around<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.520> house

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just whatever you have around the house

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.360 
just whatever you have around the house
you<00:03:38.290> know<00:03:38.350> if<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.560> don't<00:03:38.710> want<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.950> light<00:03:39.160> that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
you know if you don't want to light that

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.420 
you know if you don't want to light that
telescopes<00:03:39.970> out<00:03:40.120> like<00:03:40.330> this<00:03:40.540> one<00:03:40.720> though

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
telescopes out like this one though

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.650 
telescopes out like this one though
you'll<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.640> get<00:03:42.760> creative<00:03:43.000> them<00:03:43.450> get

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
you'll have to get creative them get

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.570 
you'll have to get creative them get
maybe<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.350> white<00:03:44.650> piece<00:03:44.830> cardboard<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.430> put

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
maybe a white piece cardboard to put

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.340 
maybe a white piece cardboard to put
right<00:03:45.760> here<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.660> then<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:46.990> your<00:03:47.110> light

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
right here and then have your light

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.980 
right here and then have your light
shine<00:03:48.190> onto<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.700> cardboard<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.390> then<00:03:49.870> it

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
shine onto the cardboard and then it

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.900 
shine onto the cardboard and then it
will<00:03:50.080> diffuse<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.680> down<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.370> that's<00:03:51.730> how

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
will diffuse that down and that's how

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.460 
will diffuse that down and that's how
you'd<00:03:52.120> probably<00:03:52.300> get<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.720> really<00:03:52.870> soft

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
you'd probably get that really soft

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.300 
you'd probably get that really soft
light<00:03:53.740> that<00:03:53.980> way<00:03:54.270> so<00:03:55.270> other<00:03:55.900> than<00:03:56.020> that<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.410> like

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
light that way so other than that I like

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.330 
light that way so other than that I like
I<00:03:57.730> like<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.240> set<00:03:58.450> up<00:03:58.540> quite<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.780> bit<00:03:58.960> it<00:03:59.340> gives

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
I like this set up quite a bit it gives

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.960 
I like this set up quite a bit it gives
