similar<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> Mac<00:00:40.700> 137<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.270> maybe

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
similar to a Mac 137 I think it is maybe

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.010 
similar to a Mac 137 I think it is maybe
it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> 138<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> sigma<00:00:44.190> f-35<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it's a 138 and it's a sigma f-35 and I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's a 138 and it's a sigma f-35 and I
use<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.489> under<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.969> eye<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.480> set

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
use this a lot for under the eye to set

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
use this a lot for under the eye to set
under<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> eye<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.620> gives<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.160> nice<00:00:50.399> feel

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
under the eye it just gives a nice feel

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
under the eye it just gives a nice feel
but<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.350> has<00:00:53.039> been<00:00:53.280> shedding<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
but this one has been shedding so I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
but this one has been shedding so I
wanted<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> find<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.989> replacement<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
wanted to find a replacement for it so I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.250 
wanted to find a replacement for it so I
had<00:00:56.730> seen<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> lot<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> reviews<00:00:57.809> about<00:00:57.840> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
can see right here first of all how much

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
can see right here first of all how much
larger<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.630> than<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.710> also

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
larger this one is than that it's also

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.219 
larger this one is than that it's also
not<00:01:23.100> quite<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.729> pointed<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.450> tapered<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
not quite as pointed or tapered it is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.850 
not quite as pointed or tapered it is
much<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.619> flared<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:27.420> will<00:01:27.900> say<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.560> far

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
much more flared out I will say as far

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
much more flared out I will say as far
as<00:01:28.920> softness<00:01:29.490> they're<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:30.150> similar<00:01:31.020> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
as softness they're very similar this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.580 
as softness they're very similar this
one<00:01:31.500> might<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.369> softer<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
one might be a little bit softer that is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
one might be a little bit softer that is
probably<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.009> biggest<00:01:35.280> complaint<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
probably my biggest complaint about this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably my biggest complaint about this
brush<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.439> first<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> all<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.670> too

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
brush it is first of all it's way too

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.319 
brush it is first of all it's way too
big<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.060> under<00:01:39.390> eyes<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.380> blush

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
big for under eyes so it is for blush

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.550 
big for under eyes so it is for blush
which<00:01:42.329> isn't<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> want<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> do
