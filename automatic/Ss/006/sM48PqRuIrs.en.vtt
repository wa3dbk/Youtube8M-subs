00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
sink I'm just going to use this funnel

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.500 
sink I'm just going to use this funnel
and<00:00:22.050> put<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.619> there<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.910> first<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.240> want<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and put it on there so first you want to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
and put it on there so first you want to
fill<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> halfway<00:00:27.990> full<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.710> water<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.820> could

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
fill it halfway full of water you could

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.720 
fill it halfway full of water you could
start<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.390> vinegar<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.279> water<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
start with vinegar but water is kind of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.110 
start with vinegar but water is kind of
easier<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.940> ahead<00:00:36.000> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
easier so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
easier so I'm just gonna go ahead and
pour<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> hopefully<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.140> works<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.649> one

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
pour it hopefully this works with one

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:51.390 
pour it hopefully this works with one
hand

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
okay well it kind of worked kind of me

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
just spit all over there but so that's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.360
