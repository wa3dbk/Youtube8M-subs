andrew tell me a little bit about this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.390 
andrew tell me a little bit about this
is<00:00:21.150> eli<00:00:21.600> right<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.740> natural

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
is eli right this is a this is a natural

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.839 
is eli right this is a this is a natural
mineral<00:00:23.760> called<00:00:23.970> Xilai<00:00:24.480> right<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.099> part

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
mineral called Xilai right it's a part

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.929 
mineral called Xilai right it's a part
of<00:00:26.939> nature<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.230> few

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
of nature and it is one of the very few

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.339 
of nature and it is one of the very few
minerals<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.119> nature<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> has<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.990> negative

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
minerals in nature that has a negative

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.979 
minerals in nature that has a negative
charge<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.790> what<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.180> basically<00:00:33.750> does

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
charge so what did that basically does

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
charge so what did that basically does
is<00:00:34.200> it'll<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.309> body<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
is it'll just go into your body and in a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.560 
is it'll just go into your body and in a
really<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:38.100> real<00:00:38.309> simplified<00:00:39.059> way<00:00:39.270> acts

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
really in a real simplified way acts

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
really in a real simplified way acts
like<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.079> Pacman<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.219> go

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
like a little Pacman and it will just go

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
like a little Pacman and it will just go
and<00:00:41.520> grab<00:00:41.670> any<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> chemicals<00:00:42.660> heavy

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and grab any of the chemicals heavy

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.170 
and grab any of the chemicals heavy
metals<00:00:43.350> or<00:00:43.500> toxins<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.940> body

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that aren't meant to be in there and you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
that aren't meant to be in there and you
just<00:00:47.010> eliminate<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.360> probably<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.110> most

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
just eliminate it it's probably the most

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
just eliminate it it's probably the most
of<00:00:49.980> simplest<00:00:50.730> effective<00:00:53.480> what's<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> word

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
of simplest effective what's the word

at all that's again what did the
zeolites<00:05:10.240> is<00:05:10.390> one<00:05:10.570> product<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.500> really

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
zeolites is one product that it really

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.840 
zeolites is one product that it really
minimizes<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.800> ill<00:05:14.800> effects<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.400> if<00:05:15.550> getting

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
minimizes the ill effects and if getting

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.310 
minimizes the ill effects and if getting
the<00:05:15.940> chemicals<00:05:16.419> out<00:05:16.510> that<00:05:16.750> holds<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.050> in<00:05:17.200> its

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
the chemicals out that holds it in its

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.719 
the chemicals out that holds it in its
little<00:05:17.530> cage

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
little cage

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.319 
little cage
so<00:05:19.449> what<00:05:19.990> we're<00:05:20.139> going<00:05:20.229> to
