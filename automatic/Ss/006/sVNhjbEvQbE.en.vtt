00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
he drops one to two diamonds so it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.620 
he drops one to two diamonds so it
doesn't<00:04:20.950> mean<00:04:21.039> it<00:04:21.159> he<00:04:21.370> will<00:04:21.489> always<00:04:21.789> drop<00:04:22.270> one

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
doesn't mean it he will always drop one

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.040 
doesn't mean it he will always drop one
diamond<00:04:22.900> but<00:04:23.169> he<00:04:23.380> should

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
