don't quite get it inside that's like

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.970 
don't quite get it inside that's like
one<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> most<00:00:51.960> frustrating<00:00:52.199> things<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
one of the most frustrating things in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
one of the most frustrating things in
video<00:00:53.190> games<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.520> when<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
video games just when you have a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
video games just when you have a
something<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
something that's time like that and you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.819 
something that's time like that and you
just<00:00:56.100> barely<00:00:56.940> missed<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> limit<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.770> we

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
just barely missed the limit but we

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.990 
just barely missed the limit but we
should<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> here<00:00:59.579> me<00:01:00.350> yep<00:01:01.699> plenty<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> time

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
should get it here me yep plenty of time

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.420 
should get it here me yep plenty of time
left<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.619> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.189> slow

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
left so they just kind of take it slow

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.710 
left so they just kind of take it slow
you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.729> cuz<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.060> blocks<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> little

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you know cuz those blocks are a little

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.899 
you know cuz those blocks are a little
narrow<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.189> slows<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
narrow but you know not to slows is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.750 
narrow but you know not to slows is
there's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> time

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there's a time

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's a time
and<00:01:11.850> watch<00:01:12.690> out<00:01:12.870> for<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.080> fire<00:01:13.880> I'm<00:01:14.880> gonna<00:01:15.060> go

like the plain sight by these amps

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.090 
like the plain sight by these amps
pretty<00:01:40.800> easy<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.250> avoid<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.760> stuff<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:43.100> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

on<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.020> yellow<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> air<00:01:47.310> son<00:01:47.520> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
on this yellow on the air son this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.750 
on this yellow on the air son this
yellow<00:01:47.910> block<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.080> can<00:01:49.230> see<00:01:49.670> there<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.790> go

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
yellow block you can see there we go

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.890 
yellow block you can see there we go
there<00:01:53.760> might<00:01:53.910> be<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.120> one<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.420> them<00:01:54.540> right<00:01:54.660> nope

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
there might be a one of them right nope

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.640 
there might be a one of them right nope
just<00:01:54.990> coins<00:01:56.870> there<00:01:57.870> there's<00:01:58.080> another<00:01:58.140> red

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
just coins there there's another red

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.390 
just coins there there's another red
coin<00:01:58.890> and<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:01.440> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.650> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> sit<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.160> that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
coin and so if you kind of sit on that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.460 
coin and so if you kind of sit on that
side<00:02:02.760> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> platform<00:02:03.390> Walt's<00:02:03.960> rotating

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
side of the platform Walt's rotating

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.330 
side of the platform Walt's rotating
around<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.860> should<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.220> get<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.820> that

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
around you should just get out of that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.620 
around you should just get out of that
and<00:02:08.340> we're<00:02:08.580> gonna<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:09.210> going<00:02:09.480> to<00:02:09.540> make

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
and we're gonna you're going to make

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.200 
and we're gonna you're going to make
sure<00:02:09.960> that<00:02:10.250> time<00:02:11.250> distress<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
sure that time distress you can get a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.390 
sure that time distress you can get a
you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.870> over<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.230> platform<00:02:13.740> and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you know get over to that platform and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.290 
you know get over to that platform and
then<00:02:15.150> uh<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:16.290> part<00:02:16.670> can<00:02:17.670> be<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.880> little<00:02:17.910> tricky

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
then uh this part can be a little tricky

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.150 
then uh this part can be a little tricky
because<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.020> narrow<00:02:19.380> path<00:02:19.740> but

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
because it's a really narrow path but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.910 
because it's a really narrow path but
you<00:02:20.370> shouldn't<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> problem<00:02:21.540> just

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
you shouldn't really have a problem just

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.550 
you shouldn't really have a problem just
make<00:02:22.920> sure<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.370> pretty<00:02:23.700> slowly<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:25.440> way

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
make sure you go pretty slowly that way

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680 
make sure you go pretty slowly that way
if<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.890> kind<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.400> trip<00:02:27.180> up<00:02:27.360> or<00:02:27.540> anything

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
if you kind of like trip up or anything

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.479 
if you kind of like trip up or anything
like<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.380> you'll<00:02:28.770> get<00:02:28.920> like<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> second

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
like that and you'll get like a second

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.580 
like that and you'll get like a second
chance<00:02:29.520> cuz<00:02:29.910> you'll<00:02:30.030> hang<00:02:30.300> on

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
chance cuz you'll hang on

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.490 
chance cuz you'll hang on
edge<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:32.360> wait<00:02:32.510> for<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.690> amped<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.349> go

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
edge I just wait for that amped can go

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.120 
edge I just wait for that amped can go
around<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.060> you'll<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.390> point<00:02:36.130> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
around and you'll get that point and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.449 
around and you'll get that point and
make<00:02:37.670> your<00:02:37.819> way<00:02:38.000> down<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:40.069> was<00:02:40.220> pretty

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
make your way down to that was pretty

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.430 
make your way down to that was pretty
close<00:02:40.700> called<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.150> that's<00:02:42.050> what<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.260> mean

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
close called in that's what I mean

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.190 
close called in that's what I mean
though<00:02:42.620> about<00:02:42.800> going<00:02:43.099> slowly<00:02:43.430> because<00:02:44.200> that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
though about going slowly because that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.710 
though about going slowly because that
way<00:02:45.319> we<00:02:45.500> still<00:02:45.709> hang<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.220> edge<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
way we still hang on to the edge and the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.509 
way we still hang on to the edge and the
camera<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.170> be<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> little<00:02:48.530> difficult<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:49.190> see

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
camera can be a little difficult to see

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.559 
camera can be a little difficult to see
here<00:02:50.260> you're<00:02:51.260> not<00:02:51.349> careful<00:02:51.680> but<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:53.209> not<00:02:53.390> too

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
here you're not careful but it's not too

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.610 
here you're not careful but it's not too
difficult<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.959> get<00:02:54.110> across<00:02:54.349> those<00:02:54.560> platforms

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
difficult to get across those platforms

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.190 
difficult to get across those platforms
they<00:02:55.310> tilt<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.910> know<00:02:56.060> kind<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.330> sea<00:02:56.540> salt<00:02:56.780> type

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
they tilt you know kind of sea salt type

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.949 
they tilt you know kind of sea salt type
platforms<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.970> we're<00:02:59.150> gonna<00:02:59.239> make<00:02:59.780> our<00:02:59.840> way

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
platforms and we're gonna make our way

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.840 
platforms and we're gonna make our way
over<00:03:00.140> here<00:03:01.180> there's<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> couple<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:02.630> UPS<00:03:02.810> here

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
over here there's a couple one UPS here

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.690 
over here there's a couple one UPS here
let's<00:03:04.850> see<00:03:05.030> what's<00:03:05.180> guess<00:03:05.450> said<00:03:06.250> no<00:03:07.250> he<00:03:07.549> just

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
let's see what's guess said no he just

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.430 
let's see what's guess said no he just
showed<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.970> with<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.180> Red<00:03:08.299> Coins<00:03:08.480> bar<00:03:08.840> we

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
showed you with the Red Coins bar we

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.630 
showed you with the Red Coins bar we
already<00:03:09.799> know<00:03:09.890> where<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:10.100> are<00:03:10.280> there's<00:03:10.489> one

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
already know where this are there's one

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.309 
already know where this are there's one
right<00:03:10.819> there<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.510> platform<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.170> just

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
right there on that platform and just

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.690 
right there on that platform and just
open<00:03:13.130> room<00:03:13.250> button<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.530> go<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.640> you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
open room button there you go and you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460 
open room button there you go and you
put<00:03:16.910> there<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.660> might<00:03:17.810> not<00:03:17.930> even<00:03:18.080> need<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.410> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
put there you might not even need it the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.500 
put there you might not even need it the
long<00:03:18.620> jump<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.010> guess<00:03:19.190> I'll<00:03:19.849> just<00:03:19.880> go<00:03:20.209> down<00:03:20.390> this

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
long jump I guess I'll just go down this

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.160 
long jump I guess I'll just go down this
way<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.569> we're<00:03:23.569> going<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.810> make<00:03:23.930> her<00:03:24.019> way

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
way and we're going to make her way

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.930 
way and we're going to make her way
across<00:03:24.200> those<00:03:24.709> cease<00:03:25.010> all<00:03:25.220> platforms<00:03:25.489> again

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
across those cease all platforms again

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.960 
across those cease all platforms again
not<00:03:26.480> too<00:03:26.690> difficult<00:03:27.170> yeah

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.440 

see<00:03:30.970> here<00:03:32.010> I'll<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.130> jump<00:03:33.490> down<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.880> that

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
see here I'll just jump down to that

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.470 
see here I'll just jump down to that
platform<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:36.280> if<00:03:36.850> I<00:03:36.940> can<00:03:37.180> get<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.450> that

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
platform because if I can get to that

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.070 
platform because if I can get to that
red<00:03:37.750> coin<00:03:37.990> from<00:03:38.170> here<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:38.560> well<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.180> yeah<00:03:40.450> it's

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
red coin from here as well so yeah it's

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.250 
red coin from here as well so yeah it's
pretty<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.920> a<00:03:42.010> short<00:03:42.280> little<00:03:42.520> jump<00:03:42.850> there

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
pretty just a short little jump there

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.330 
pretty just a short little jump there
just<00:03:44.260> make<00:03:44.380> sure<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.620> don't<00:03:44.770> overshoot<00:03:45.010> it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
just make sure you don't overshoot it

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160 
just make sure you don't overshoot it
and<00:03:45.490> they'll<00:03:45.790> be<00:03:45.820> coin<00:03:46.240> number<00:03:46.420> eight<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:46.960> we

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
and they'll be coin number eight so we

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.530 
and they'll be coin number eight so we
get<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.470> star<00:03:47.800> that's<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.640> one<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.030> two<00:03:49.210> stars

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
get that star that's a one of two stars

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.770 
get that star that's a one of two stars
in<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.780> level<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.240> we<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.480> got<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> make

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
in this level and so we just got to make

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.010 
in this level and so we just got to make
our<00:03:52.930> way<00:03:53.080> up<00:03:53.230> there<00:03:54.600> now<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.630> go<00:03:55.870> these

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
our way up there now just go these

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:02.610 
our way up there now just go these
platforms<00:03:56.560> here<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:01.210> you<00:04:02.050> hit<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.320> switch

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
platforms here and you hit that switch

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.350 
platforms here and you hit that switch
and<00:04:02.950> we'll<00:04:03.100> make<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.280> Janet's<00:04:03.880> slope<00:04:04.180> of

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
and we'll make that Janet's slope of

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.660 
and we'll make that Janet's slope of
staircase<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.140> it's<00:04:05.560> timed<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
staircase and it's timed but it

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.930 
staircase and it's timed but it
shouldn't<00:04:07.060> be<00:04:07.090> too<00:04:07.150> much<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.570> problem<00:04:07.870> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
shouldn't be too much of a problem I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.000 
shouldn't be too much of a problem I
said<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.660> have<00:04:10.690> plenty<00:04:11.170> of<00:04:11.260> time<00:04:11.350> see

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
said that you have plenty of time see

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.310 
said that you have plenty of time see
the<00:04:12.220> sciences<00:04:12.900> she's<00:04:13.900> telling<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.230> how<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
the sciences she's telling you how to

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.740 
the sciences she's telling you how to
beat<00:04:14.500> Bowser<00:04:14.680> but<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:16.270> I<00:04:16.299> was<00:04:16.540> Kent

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
beat Bowser but like I was Kent

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.099 
beat Bowser but like I was Kent
pointless

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.190 

there<00:04:21.109> we<00:04:21.230> go<00:04:21.320> now<00:04:21.709> we<00:04:21.769> have<00:04:21.920> 14<00:04:22.340> stars<00:04:22.639> or<00:04:22.970> 13<00:04:23.389> I

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
there we go now we have 14 stars or 13 I

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.620 
there we go now we have 14 stars or 13 I
got<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.830> little<00:04:24.980> hit<00:04:25.160> myself<00:04:25.370> day<00:04:28.210> all<00:04:29.210> right<00:04:29.419> I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
got a little hit myself day all right I

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.050 
got a little hit myself day all right I
got<00:04:30.110> gifted<00:04:30.860> if<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.340> notice<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.850> kind<00:04:32.000> of

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
got gifted if you notice it kind of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.400 
got gifted if you notice it kind of
skipped<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.360> bit<00:04:32.510> there<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.169> fact<00:04:33.380> that

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
skipped a bit there and the fact that

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.340 
skipped a bit there and the fact that
the<00:04:33.620> Red<00:04:33.770> Coins<00:04:33.980> are<00:04:34.250> back<00:04:34.400> it's<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:35.139> because<00:04:36.139> I

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
the Red Coins are back it's a because I

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.440 
the Red Coins are back it's a because I
kind<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.800> died<00:04:37.040> on<00:04:37.370> my<00:04:37.610> first<00:04:37.940> try<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.240> get

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
kind of died on my first try and get

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.300 
kind of died on my first try and get
this<00:04:38.630> star<00:04:38.870> because<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.290> on<00:04:39.770> one<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:39.980> my<00:04:40.070> long

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
this star because a on one of my long

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.070 
this star because a on one of my long
jumps<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.790> must<00:04:41.150> have<00:04:41.270> started<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.690> too<00:04:41.810> soon

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
jumps I must have started it too soon

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.780 
jumps I must have started it too soon
because<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.470> bounced<00:04:42.919> off<00:04:43.010> on<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.220> platforms

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
because I bounced off on the platforms

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.730 
because I bounced off on the platforms
and<00:04:43.940> died<00:04:44.150> but<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.410> really<00:04:45.530> not<00:04:45.680> that

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
and died but it's really not that

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.409 
and died but it's really not that
difficult<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.370> just<00:04:46.400> jump<00:04:47.090> across<00:04:47.210> those

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
difficult you just jump across those

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.780 
difficult you just jump across those
platforms<00:04:47.770> there's<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.889> time<00:04:49.130> limit<00:04:49.280> you<00:04:49.610> just

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
platforms there's a time limit you just

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.070 
platforms there's a time limit you just
got<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:49.970> make<00:04:50.060> sure<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.300> get<00:04:50.480> it<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.810> they're

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
got to make sure you get it and they're

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.810 
got to make sure you get it and they're
there<00:04:51.260> you<00:04:51.290> know<00:04:51.530> don't<00:04:51.740> waste<00:04:51.919> time<00:04:52.160> not<00:04:52.610> too

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
there you know don't waste time not too

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.050 
there you know don't waste time not too
difficult<00:04:53.000> though<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:55.550> then<00:04:55.790> we'll<00:04:55.880> go

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
difficult though and so then we'll go

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.870 
difficult though and so then we'll go
back<00:04:56.270> in<00:04:56.540> 5,000<00:04:57.290> now<00:04:57.380> he's<00:04:58.100> not<00:04:58.280> too<00:04:58.490> difficult

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
back in 5,000 now he's not too difficult

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.840 
back in 5,000 now he's not too difficult
the<00:04:59.169> boss<00:05:00.169> basically<00:05:01.070> it's<00:05:01.460> kind<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.700> similar

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
the boss basically it's kind of similar

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.960 
the boss basically it's kind of similar
to<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.180> big<00:05:02.390> Babylon<00:05:02.780> 5<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:02.990> we<00:05:03.230> just<00:05:03.380> did

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
to the big Babylon 5 that we just did

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.220 
to the big Babylon 5 that we just did
you're<00:05:04.970> gonna<00:05:05.060> circle<00:05:05.450> around<00:05:05.630> behind<00:05:05.840> him

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
you're gonna circle around behind him

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.370 
you're gonna circle around behind him
and<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.300> little<00:05:08.600> bit<00:05:08.720> different<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.320> a

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
and it's a little bit different in a

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.219 
and it's a little bit different in a
sense<00:05:10.390> because<00:05:11.390> instead<00:05:11.660> of<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:11.810> going

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
sense because instead of just going

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.690 
sense because instead of just going
around<00:05:12.410> behind<00:05:12.680> him<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:12.979> picking<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.490> up<00:05:13.580> and

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
around behind him and picking it up and

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.670 
around behind him and picking it up and
throwing<00:05:14.030> him<00:05:14.240> you<00:05:14.419> grab<00:05:14.960> his<00:05:15.140> tail<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.560> have

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
throwing him you grab his tail and have

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.360 
throwing him you grab his tail and have
to<00:05:15.800> swing<00:05:16.070> him<00:05:16.190> around<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:17.979> well<00:05:18.979> I'll<00:05:19.190> show

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
to swing him around and well I'll show

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.620 
to swing him around and well I'll show
you<00:05:19.460> that<00:05:19.580> here<00:05:19.820> it's<00:05:19.970> not<00:05:20.060> too<00:05:20.240> hard<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.479> get

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
you that here it's not too hard to get

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.440 
you that here it's not too hard to get
behind<00:05:20.750> him<00:05:21.639> basically<00:05:22.639> like<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.820> bomb<00:05:23.180> King

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
behind him basically like the bomb King

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.080 
behind him basically like the bomb King

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
of run around it's not too difficult

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:38.080 
of run around it's not too difficult
here

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.610 
bit more and then I was pretty bad if
you<00:05:47.240> throw<00:05:47.480> them<00:05:47.540> all<00:05:47.690> if<00:05:47.780> it's<00:05:47.930> not<00:05:48.320> really<00:05:48.530> a

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
you throw them all if it's not really a

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.750 
you throw them all if it's not really a
big<00:05:48.770> deal<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.160> don't<00:05:49.220> have<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.490> throw<00:05:49.700> them

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
big deal you don't have to throw them

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.510 
big deal you don't have to throw them
into<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.030> palms<00:05:50.360> once<00:05:50.810> for<00:05:51.680> this<00:05:52.040> particular

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
into the palms once for this particular

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.360 
into the palms once for this particular
fight<00:05:53.020> he'll<00:05:54.020> shoot<00:05:54.410> some<00:05:54.650> fire<00:05:54.919> at<00:05:54.950> you<00:05:55.250> and

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
fight he'll shoot some fire at you and

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.940 
fight he'll shoot some fire at you and
stuff<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.930> that's<00:05:56.930> pretty<00:05:57.380> easy<00:05:57.440> to<00:05:57.710> avoid

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
stuff but that's pretty easy to avoid

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.560 
stuff but that's pretty easy to avoid
and<00:05:58.900> so<00:05:59.900> you<00:05:59.960> just<00:06:00.080> grab<00:06:00.290> him<00:06:00.680> and<00:06:00.710> then<00:06:01.570> throw

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
and so you just grab him and then throw

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.050 
and so you just grab him and then throw
him<00:06:02.840> into<00:06:03.080> one<00:06:03.260> of<00:06:03.350> these<00:06:03.440> bombs<00:06:03.730> and<00:06:04.730> there<00:06:04.970> we

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
him into one of these bombs and there we

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.340 
him into one of these bombs and there we
go<00:06:05.150> again<00:06:05.180> that<00:06:05.570> time<00:06:06.010> not<00:06:07.010> too<00:06:07.190> difficult<00:06:08.350> and

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
go again that time not too difficult and

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.740 
go again that time not too difficult and
so<00:06:10.190> he'll<00:06:10.370> give<00:06:10.580> you<00:06:10.700> the<00:06:10.760> key<00:06:11.180> now<00:06:11.419> to<00:06:11.479> the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
so he'll give you the key now to the

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.890 
so he'll give you the key now to the
basement<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:13.120> now<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.180> we<00:06:14.389> have<00:06:14.600> that<00:06:16.870> we<00:06:17.870> can

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
basement so now that we have that we can

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.530 
basement so now that we have that we can
go<00:06:18.229> ahead<00:06:18.320> and<00:06:18.500> down<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.770> basement<00:06:18.950> I<00:06:19.280> guess

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
go ahead and down the basement I guess

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.180 
go ahead and down the basement I guess
but<00:06:20.540> before<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:20.990> do<00:06:21.139> that<00:06:21.169> I<00:06:21.320> think<00:06:21.590> I'll<00:06:21.800> go

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
but before we do that I think I'll go

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.850 
but before we do that I think I'll go
ahead<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.520> get<00:06:23.180> a<00:06:23.570> few<00:06:23.630> more<00:06:23.990> stars<00:06:24.350> well<00:06:24.620> up

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
ahead and get a few more stars well up

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.920 
ahead and get a few more stars well up
here<00:06:25.130> like<00:06:25.340> a<00:06:25.400> couple<00:06:25.880> and<00:06:26.150> whomps<00:06:26.450> fortress

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930
