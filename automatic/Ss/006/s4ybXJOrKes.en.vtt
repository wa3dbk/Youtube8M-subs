00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
that's how much of the tooth actually is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.710 
that's how much of the tooth actually is
exposed<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.400> used<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> killing<00:02:43.480> bite

and held fast so that it's able to take
the<00:02:52.810> enormous<00:02:53.230> torque<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:54.040> will<00:02:54.160> be

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the enormous torque that will be

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.970 
the enormous torque that will be
produced<00:02:54.459> by<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.390> animal<00:02:55.930> biting<00:02:56.590> down<00:02:56.739> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
produced by the animal biting down and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.130 
produced by the animal biting down and
then<00:02:57.100> pulling<00:02:57.459> back<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.450> had<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.600> smaller

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
then pulling back if it had a smaller

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.170 
then pulling back if it had a smaller
structure<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.130> these<00:03:00.430> teeth<00:03:00.700> would<00:03:00.940> end<00:03:01.060> up

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
structure to it these teeth would end up

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.150 
structure to it these teeth would end up
breaking<00:03:01.390> off<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.530> what<00:03:02.680> holds<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
breaking off but this is what holds it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.759 
breaking off but this is what holds it
into<00:03:03.310> place<00:03:03.959> what's<00:03:04.959> new<00:03:05.260> what's<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.739> cat

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
into place what's new what's a cat

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.220 
into place what's new what's a cat
what's<00:03:08.769> new<00:03:09.070> pussycat

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
