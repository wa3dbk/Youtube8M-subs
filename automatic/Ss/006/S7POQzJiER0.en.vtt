00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.929 
gonna fly about here and I'm gonna put
one<00:01:40.740> round<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.159> each<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> these<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.820> we're

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
one round into each of these so we're

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
one round into each of these so we're
gonna<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> top<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> left<00:01:43.170> sort<00:01:43.680> of

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
gonna put it in the top of left sort of

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.300 
gonna put it in the top of left sort of
know<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.700> top<00:01:44.939> middle<00:01:45.149> left<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:46.130> guess<00:01:47.130> that's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
know the top middle left I guess that's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.649 
know the top middle left I guess that's
two<00:01:47.460> rounds<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.119> two<00:01:48.299> houses<00:01:48.390> two

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
two rounds because it's two houses two

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
two rounds because it's two houses two
