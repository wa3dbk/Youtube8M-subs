here<00:02:14.260> however<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.860> wasn't<00:02:16.580> having<00:02:16.820> much<00:02:16.850> luck

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
here however I wasn't having much luck

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.650 
here however I wasn't having much luck
because<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:18.200> not<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:18.709> sure<00:02:19.120> what<00:02:20.120> it's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
because I'm not really sure what it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.250 
because I'm not really sure what it's
made<00:02:20.959> out<00:02:21.019> of<00:02:21.549> but<00:02:22.549> it<00:02:22.700> holds<00:02:23.660> static

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
made out of but it holds static

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.039 
made out of but it holds static
electricity<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.100> when<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.000> put<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.390> down<00:02:26.630> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
electricity and when I put it down and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.340 
electricity and when I put it down and
tried<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.769> brush<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.070> into<00:02:28.489> place<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.350> found

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
tried to brush it into place I found

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.470 
tried to brush it into place I found
that<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.709> stuck<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.310> brush<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:32.000> stuck<00:02:32.450> to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
that it stuck to the brush and stuck to

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.990 
that it stuck to the brush and stuck to
the<00:02:32.660> top<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.110> ties<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.610> haven't

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the top of the ties and I haven't

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
the top of the ties and I haven't
figured<00:02:35.150> out<00:02:35.329> a<00:02:35.390> good<00:02:35.600> way<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:36.220> relieve<00:02:37.220> that

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
figured out a good way to relieve that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.569 
figured out a good way to relieve that
so<00:02:37.880> anyway<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.930> decided<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.500> try<00:02:39.709> Arizona<00:02:40.340> rock

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
so anyway I decided to try Arizona rock

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.490 
so anyway I decided to try Arizona rock
and<00:02:40.790> minerals<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.480> settled<00:02:41.900> on<00:02:42.110> this

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and minerals and I settled on this

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.960 
and minerals and I settled on this
kinzua<00:02:43.360> railroad<00:02:45.100> shade<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.310> ballast<00:02:46.820> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
kinzua railroad shade of ballast and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.060 
kinzua railroad shade of ballast and
it's<00:02:47.600> kind<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.840> nice<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:48.350> kind<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.769> gray

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
it's kind of nice it's kind of a gray

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.100 
it's kind of nice it's kind of a gray
it's<00:02:49.519> got<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> little<00:02:49.820> bit<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.060> brown<00:02:50.390> Fleck<00:02:50.870> in

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's got a little bit of brown Fleck in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.080 
it's got a little bit of brown Fleck in
it<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.500> kind<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.280> little<00:02:52.549> even<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> little

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
it and kind of a little even a little

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.410 
it and kind of a little even a little
bit<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.420> mauve<00:02:53.660> color<00:02:54.079> sort<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:55.239> although<00:02:56.239> not

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bit of mauve color sort of although not

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.410 
bit of mauve color sort of although not
real<00:02:56.630> visible<00:02:56.989> anyway<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.850> still<00:02:59.090> wet

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
real visible anyway I this is still wet

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.810 
real visible anyway I this is still wet
I<00:02:59.720> just<00:03:00.200> experimented<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.340> piece<00:03:01.579> here

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
I just experimented with this piece here

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.600 
I just experimented with this piece here
this<00:03:02.060> morning<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:03.130> think<00:03:04.130> when<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> gets

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
this morning and I think when it gets

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.940 
this morning and I think when it gets
dry<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.570> be<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.989> perfect<00:03:06.650> color

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
dry it's going to be the perfect color

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.720 
dry it's going to be the perfect color
for<00:03:07.070> here<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:09.140> lays<00:03:09.380> down<00:03:09.709> real<00:03:10.070> well<00:03:10.280> it

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
for here and it lays down real well it

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.400 
for here and it lays down real well it
does<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.090> not<00:03:11.239> full<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.480> static<00:03:11.810> doesn't

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
does it's not full of static doesn't

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.699 
does it's not full of static doesn't
stick<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.860> brush<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:14.090> very<00:03:14.480> easy<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.380> put

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
stick to the brush it's very easy to put

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.270 
stick to the brush it's very easy to put
on<00:03:15.739> much<00:03:16.310> easier<00:03:16.730> than<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.269> had<00:03:17.450> anticipated

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
on much easier than I had anticipated

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.069 
on much easier than I had anticipated
and<00:03:19.280> much<00:03:19.760> easier<00:03:19.790> than<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.450> woodland<00:03:20.810> scenes

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
and much easier than the woodland scenes

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.300 
and much easier than the woodland scenes
was<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:24.019> really<00:03:24.440> that's<00:03:24.590> about<00:03:24.920> all<00:03:24.950> I've<00:03:25.280> been

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
was so really that's about all I've been

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.410 
was so really that's about all I've been
doing<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.940> see<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.239> took

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
doing you can see that I took

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.199 
doing you can see that I took
took<00:03:27.630> several<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.740> buildings<00:03:29.190> off<00:03:29.430> here<00:03:29.849> I

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
took several the buildings off here I

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.229 
took several the buildings off here I
did<00:03:31.050> order<00:03:31.440> some<00:03:31.800> NJ<00:03:32.160> international<00:03:32.970> switch

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
did order some NJ international switch

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.870 
did order some NJ international switch
stands<00:03:33.599> here<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:35.459> I'm<00:03:35.580> trying<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:38.580> I'm

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
stands here what I'm trying to do is I'm

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.240 
stands here what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.239> figure<00:03:39.510> out<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.840> way<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> transfer

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
trying to figure out a way to transfer

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.380 
trying to figure out a way to transfer
the<00:03:41.400> motion<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:43.200> turnout<00:03:43.739> control<00:03:44.390> from

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the motion of the turnout control from

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.930 
the motion of the turnout control from
this<00:03:45.810> direction<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:47.520> actually<00:03:48.330> rotate<00:03:49.050> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
this direction to actually rotate the

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.330 
this direction to actually rotate the
the<00:03:50.940> switch<00:03:51.600> stand<00:03:51.959> when<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.530> turnout<00:03:53.190> is

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
the switch stand when the turnout is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.520 
the switch stand when the turnout is
strong<00:03:53.640> with<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.060> tortoise<00:03:54.420> machine<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.019> I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
strong with the tortoise machine and I

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.870 
strong with the tortoise machine and I
haven't<00:03:55.769> quite<00:03:55.890> figured<00:03:56.100> out<00:03:56.250> how<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.400> do<00:03:56.670> that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
haven't quite figured out how to do that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.470 
haven't quite figured out how to do that
yet<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:58.140> I'm<00:03:58.349> getting<00:03:58.620> there<00:03:59.060> I'll<00:04:00.060> post<00:04:00.420> some

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
yet but I'm getting there I'll post some

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.710 
yet but I'm getting there I'll post some
more<00:04:00.600> on<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.050> when<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.350> do<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> next<00:04:01.890> video

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
more on that when I do the next video

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.240 
more on that when I do the next video
but<00:04:04.069> so<00:04:05.069> far<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.780> track<00:04:07.049> work<00:04:07.380> is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
but so far I think the track work is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.030 
but so far I think the track work is
coming<00:04:08.580> together<00:04:08.819> real<00:04:09.239> nicely<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:10.040> have

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
coming together real nicely I have

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.009 
coming together real nicely I have
experimented<00:04:11.880> with<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.090> locomotive<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.750> cars

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
experimented with the locomotive in cars

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.190 
experimented with the locomotive in cars
and<00:04:13.350> everything<00:04:13.440> seems<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.160> run<00:04:14.340> pretty<00:04:14.640> well

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
and everything seems to run pretty well

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.270 
and everything seems to run pretty well
there<00:04:16.200> again<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.560> think<00:04:16.709> we've<00:04:16.950> talked<00:04:17.160> about

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
there again I think we've talked about

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.430 
there again I think we've talked about
it<00:04:17.400> before<00:04:17.489> but<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.060> haven't<00:04:18.450> put<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.989> in<00:04:19.229> yet

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
it before but I haven't put this in yet

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.289 
it before but I haven't put this in yet
because<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.919> will<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.220> an<00:04:20.310> elevated<00:04:20.970> coal

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
because this will be an elevated coal

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.110 
because this will be an elevated coal
dock<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.959> cold<00:04:22.229> facility<00:04:22.860> here<00:04:23.160> local<00:04:23.880> coal

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
dock and cold facility here local coal

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.010 
dock and cold facility here local coal
facility<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:26.010> I'm<00:04:26.040> waiting<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.840> get<00:04:27.840> the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
facility so I'm waiting to get the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.690 
facility so I'm waiting to get the
ballasting<00:04:28.560> done<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:29.070> forth<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> rest

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
ballasting done and so forth on the rest

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.129 
ballasting done and so forth on the rest
of<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.880> track<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.419> then<00:04:30.479> I'll<00:04:30.630> work<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:30.960> this

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
of the track and then I'll work on this

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.150 
of the track and then I'll work on this
elevated<00:04:31.710> section<00:04:32.100> here<00:04:33.890> although<00:04:34.890> it's<00:04:35.070> not

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
elevated section here although it's not

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.990 
elevated section here although it's not
here<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.610> do<00:04:36.060> have<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:38.100> engine<00:04:38.460> house<00:04:38.640> done

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
here I do have the the engine house done

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.570 
here I do have the the engine house done
and<00:04:39.360> i<00:04:39.690> don't<00:04:39.870> know<00:04:39.930> if<00:04:40.169> i<00:04:40.260> had<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.160> engine

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
and i don't know if i had the engine

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.060 
and i don't know if i had the engine
house<00:04:41.729> off<00:04:42.060> when<00:04:42.390> I've<00:04:42.539> taken<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.500> picture<00:04:43.740> here

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
house off when I've taken a picture here
