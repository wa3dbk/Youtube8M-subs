00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.910
 or talking is good text 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:23.110
 Today I'm going to teach you a nail. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.779
 for the brides for the trainees for the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.529
 girls of 15 years or even who wants 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.300
 which I normally use 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.320
 I do not have this make-up business. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.970
 bride to nail nail bridal hair 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.530
 water hair does not have it not 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.350
 when I'm about to use my own 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.150
 cables there is no rule that the line 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.540
 only those who can use a 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:51.520
 Francesinha is a fiancee or a teenager who 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:58.960
 will be 15 years old 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:01.240
 certain is the intense use is not so I go 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.000
 teach you how I do 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.990
 Perfect French nail I make her 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.020
 also simply by removing the enamel and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.119
 passing on the right nail but when I 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.359
 I want her to be really perfect. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:21.939
 I come here at the micropore and easy 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.850
 here as you become that place as 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.609
 you see I've done some right 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 Your Honor, I did not all miss 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.280
 process from here that I'll take to give 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.700
 the example 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:40.780
 I come with a micro for z and do the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.999
 Measuring sÃ© I could put it up 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.159
 here is where my mother really is right here 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.780
 hurt too much exaggerated so I did not 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:57.789
 I really like the ending and do not like it very much. 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:00.119
 thick is already placed on ft 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.200
 make sure it's snug 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.329
 not to leak 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.329
 It's very simple, I here. 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.080
 I had my papes come here and I step 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.950
 Of course I can not so the grass is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 rye 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:47.650
 and I hope to dry opel here and it just pulls that 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:51.310
 it leaves now do not pull anterior 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.390
 francesinha is dry if you pull 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 I still have not gotten the nail polish 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.350
 and it will hurt all your work 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.190
 I use the zin caliper which is easier to 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.610
 leave the incurs the vice gave now 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610
 base 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.320
 and I hope to dry again to be able to 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.320
 apply others say highs 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.409
 now past more or less so five 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.340
 minutes you let base dry a little 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:43.810
 Then you come in the enamel if this is the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:49.840
 big enamel universe is the race line 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.840
 breed is from the brazilian breed lusaka the name 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.510
 so ok I already spent these others here 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:06.340
 pass the hand 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.340
 let's move that we made right 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:15.879
 note that just so you can see have 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.879
 excess and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.950
 and we will pass 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.640
 Elton 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.060
 last since now we will 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.430
 wait until I have gone dry again 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.400
 wait five more minutes for us 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.280
 comes with the ons with two layers of it's name 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.180
 his sunshine 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.620
 he is from the big one gives a balanced watermill 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:06.400
 in him, right? 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:09.600
 I will continue mixing well and it is already 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.600
 to pass dense layer 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.869
 very generous saw 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.680
 your first layer where you wait for a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.570
 we'll get back together again and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.570
 We 'll clean this later. 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.350
 nor faletti so that's how my 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:57.290
 Nah, she's a little bit cranky. 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.290
 still because I passed a drying eye 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:11.910
 they looked like pink and 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:15.780
 golden godmothers for the trainees 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.870
 for anyone who wants to use it, that's it 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.650
 the kisses and cheeses to the
