00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
basically it's a emulator emulating

which was the last patch before the CU
or<00:02:08.729> combat<00:02:09.149> upgrade<00:02:09.509> hit

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.550 

so<00:02:13.120> yeah<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.720> they're<00:02:13.870> emulating

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so yeah that's what they're emulating

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.110 
so yeah that's what they're emulating
and<00:02:14.769> then<00:02:15.160> what<00:02:15.280> they<00:02:15.400> plan<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.000> in<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and then what they plan to get to in the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.809 
and then what they plan to get to in the
future<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.569> then<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.780> course<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:18.580> course

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
future and then of course they of course

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.270 
future and then of course they of course
they<00:02:19.209> did<00:02:19.390> say<00:02:19.599> they<00:02:19.629> would<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.739> would<00:02:20.830> add<00:02:21.010> new

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
they did say they would it would add new

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
they did say they would it would add new
stuff<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.720> future<00:02:23.080> I'm<00:02:23.290> pretty<00:02:23.530> sure<00:02:23.739> they

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
stuff in the future I'm pretty sure they

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.220 
stuff in the future I'm pretty sure they
said<00:02:24.129> that<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:25.300> know<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.780> course<00:02:25.989> once

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
said that you know but of course once

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.520 
said that you know but of course once
they<00:02:26.410> get<00:02:26.530> done<00:02:26.739> with<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> actual<00:02:27.160> how<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.730> was

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
they get done with the actual how it was

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.020 
they get done with the actual how it was
so<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> players<00:02:30.280> city<00:02:30.610> lived<00:02:30.879> to

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
so this is the players city lived to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.640 
so this is the players city lived to
rebel<00:02:31.330> as<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:31.959> see<00:02:32.170> there's<00:02:32.379> quite<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.590> bit

once again I'm really sorry this is a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.370 
once again I'm really sorry this is a
really<00:03:41.680> scattered<00:03:41.950> video<00:03:42.419> but<00:03:43.419> I<00:03:43.450> thought<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
really scattered video but I thought it

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.949 
really scattered video but I thought it
deserves<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.859> little<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.430> know<00:03:45.549> update<00:03:46.030> so

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
deserves a little you know update so

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.809 
deserves a little you know update so

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
things felt itself in my head that they

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.909 
things felt itself in my head that they

they<00:03:54.760> are<00:03:54.910> actually<00:03:55.090> spawned<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.260> Liberator<00:03:57.099> a

they are actually spawned in Liberator a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.750 
they are actually spawned in Liberator a
lot<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> lot<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:59.910> mobs<00:04:00.910> were<00:04:01.919> they<00:04:02.919> were<00:04:02.980> if<00:04:03.430> they

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
lot a lot of mobs were they were if they

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.849 
lot a lot of mobs were they were if they
were<00:04:03.819> smaller<00:04:04.389> mops<00:04:05.049> they<00:04:05.230> were<00:04:05.290> underground

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
were smaller mops they were underground

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.680 
were smaller mops they were underground
and<00:04:06.220> if<00:04:06.340> they<00:04:06.489> were<00:04:06.549> like<00:04:06.849> banthas<00:04:07.419> they<00:04:07.630> were

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and if they were like banthas they were

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.520 
and if they were like banthas they were
super<00:04:08.230> super<00:04:08.530> tiny<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.910> was<00:04:10.030> really

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
super super tiny and it was really

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.530 
super super tiny and it was really
aggravating<00:04:11.669> well<00:04:12.669> it<00:04:12.790> wasn't<00:04:12.940> aggravating

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
aggravating well it wasn't aggravating

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.000 
aggravating well it wasn't aggravating
it<00:04:13.630> was<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:13.870> kind<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.169> dumb<00:04:14.410> fighting<00:04:14.799> you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
it was just kind of dumb fighting you

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.279 
it was just kind of dumb fighting you
know<00:04:15.040> ghosts<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.849> guess<00:04:16.150> another<00:04:16.989> thing<00:04:17.139> that

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
know ghosts I guess another thing that

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.449 
know ghosts I guess another thing that
doesn't<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:17.889> do<00:04:18.039> with<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.250> game

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
doesn't really have to do with the game

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.930 
doesn't really have to do with the game
but<00:04:18.789> I'm<00:04:19.030> excited<00:04:19.419> for<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:20.049> pvp<00:04:20.849> people<00:04:21.849> I've

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
but I'm excited for is pvp people I've

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
but I'm excited for is pvp people I've
talked<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
talked to

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.110 
talked to
and<00:04:23.050> from<00:04:23.319> what<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.560> can<00:04:23.680> kind<00:04:24.069> of<00:04:24.160> see<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.940> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
and from what I can kind of see on the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.710 
and from what I can kind of see on the
forums<00:04:25.509> are<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:26.050> more<00:04:27.030> encouraged<00:04:28.030> for<00:04:28.270> PvP

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
forums are a lot more encouraged for PvP

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.240 
forums are a lot more encouraged for PvP
now<00:04:28.990> than<00:04:29.289> they<00:04:29.380> were<00:04:29.410> on<00:04:29.560> Liberator<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
now than they were on Liberator of

now than they were on Liberator of
course<00:04:30.639> they'll<00:04:30.789> be<00:04:30.819> the<00:04:31.030> most<00:04:31.210> encouraging

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
course they'll be the most encouraging

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.240 
course they'll be the most encouraging
one<00:04:31.870> point<00:04:32.139> 0<00:04:32.259> because<00:04:32.830> they<00:04:32.949> won't<00:04:33.069> have<00:04:33.220> a

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
one point 0 because they won't have a

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.749 
one point 0 because they won't have a
wipe<00:04:33.520> because<00:04:34.080> pvp<00:04:35.080> gear<00:04:36.069> can<00:04:36.340> take<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> while

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
wipe because pvp gear can take a while

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.430 
wipe because pvp gear can take a while
to<00:04:36.940> grind<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:37.509> I'm<00:04:37.660> really<00:04:37.840> excited<00:04:38.080> for<00:04:38.259> that
