there are a couple really good decisions
made<00:00:22.580> early<00:00:23.030> on<00:00:23.180> in<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.170> project

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
made early on in the project

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.000 
made early on in the project
one<00:00:25.100> was<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.700> casting<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.180> Mark<00:00:26.450> Ruffalo<00:00:27.010> not

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
one was the casting of Mark Ruffalo not

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.790 
one was the casting of Mark Ruffalo not
only<00:00:28.250> because<00:00:28.520> he<00:00:28.880> has<00:00:29.210> this<00:00:29.450> great<00:00:29.900> facial

manner he's also a very patient actor
and<00:00:35.840> he<00:00:36.110> let<00:00:36.320> us<00:00:36.440> capture<00:00:37.010> all<00:00:37.310> kinds<00:00:37.700> of<00:00:37.790> data

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
and he let us capture all kinds of data

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.540 
and he let us capture all kinds of data
from<00:00:38.239> him<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.720> we<00:00:39.140> built<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.830> Mark<00:00:40.130> Ruffalo

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
from him and we built a a Mark Ruffalo

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.790 
from him and we built a a Mark Ruffalo
model<00:00:41.330> with<00:00:41.720> tremendous<00:00:42.500> amount<00:00:42.739> of

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
model with tremendous amount of

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.920 
model with tremendous amount of
resolution<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.670> get<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.940> essence<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.510> Mark

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
resolution to get the essence of Mark

resolution to get the essence of Mark
Ruffalo<00:00:45.260> into<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:45.590> hulk<00:00:45.770> we<00:00:45.950> took<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.760> of

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
Ruffalo into the hulk we took a lot of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.630 
Ruffalo into the hulk we took a lot of
the<00:00:47.120> skin<00:00:47.809> details<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.739> Grey's<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.190> his<00:00:49.309> hair

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
the skin details the Grey's of his hair

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.540 
the skin details the Grey's of his hair
even<00:00:50.570> right<00:00:50.750> down<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.140> his<00:00:51.230> finger<00:00:51.650> prints<00:00:51.920> so

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
even right down to his finger prints so

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.490 
even right down to his finger prints so
we<00:00:52.790> made<00:00:53.210> sure<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.390> all<00:00:53.750> of<00:00:53.900> that<00:00:53.930> was<00:00:54.260> in<00:00:54.320> the

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
we made sure that all of that was in the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.350 
we made sure that all of that was in the
model<00:00:54.949> just<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.910> give<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.300> extra

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
model just to to give it that extra

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.610 
model just to to give it that extra
subliminal<00:00:57.260> layer<00:00:57.530> of<00:00:58.809> mark<00:00:59.809> we<00:01:00.260> took<00:01:00.410> Mark

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
subliminal layer of mark we took Mark

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.619 
subliminal layer of mark we took Mark
Ruffalo<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.250> light<00:01:01.580> stage<00:01:01.850> which<00:01:02.089> is<00:01:02.120> kind

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
Ruffalo to the light stage which is kind

of a dome of lights that the actor sits
in<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.699> then<00:01:04.790> different<00:01:05.239> cameras<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.600> lights

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
in and then different cameras and lights

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.950 
in and then different cameras and lights
fire<00:01:06.230> and<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.620> captures<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.070> high<00:01:07.430> resolution

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
fire and it captures a high resolution

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.750

model of their head with high resolution

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.370 
model of their head with high resolution
textures<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.360> that's<00:01:11.630> fantastic<00:01:12.260> reference

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
textures and that's fantastic reference

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.250 
textures and that's fantastic reference
to<00:01:12.710> have<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:13.280> did<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.990> texture<00:01:14.990> shoot

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
to have we did a texture shoot

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.410 
to have we did a texture shoot
especially<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.370> get<00:01:16.490> his<00:01:16.760> clothing<00:01:17.060> because

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
especially to get his clothing because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.240 
especially to get his clothing because
we<00:01:17.510> knew<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.780> his<00:01:18.140> clothing<00:01:18.440> was<00:01:18.950> gonna<00:01:19.070> have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
we knew that his clothing was gonna have

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.890 
we knew that his clothing was gonna have
to<00:01:19.310> hold<00:01:19.460> up<00:01:19.610> in<00:01:19.760> many<00:01:19.970> many<00:01:20.150> shots<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.780> it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
to hold up in many many shots and it's

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.250 
to hold up in many many shots and it's
gonna<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.260> rip<00:01:21.409> apart<00:01:22.120> we<00:01:23.120> also<00:01:23.260> did

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
gonna have to rip apart we also did

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.030 
gonna have to rip apart we also did
lifecast

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
lifecast

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.750 
lifecast
of<00:01:25.130> his<00:01:26.030> face<00:01:26.510> his<00:01:26.870> hand<00:01:27.590> his<00:01:27.890> feet<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.430> a

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
of his face his hand his feet and a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.470 
of his face his hand his feet and a
dental<00:01:29.150> mold

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
dental mold

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.840 
dental mold
so<00:01:29.630> even<00:01:29.900> hoax<00:01:30.230> teeth<00:01:30.560> are<00:01:30.830> sort<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.430> a<00:01:31.550> hulked

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
so even hoax teeth are sort of a hulked

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.960 
so even hoax teeth are sort of a hulked
out<00:01:31.970> version<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:33.010> Mark<00:01:34.010> Ruffalo's<00:01:34.400> teeth<00:01:34.640> so

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
out version of Mark Ruffalo's teeth so

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.610 
out version of Mark Ruffalo's teeth so
this<00:01:35.120> is<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.360> urethane<00:01:35.630> cast<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.440> Mark

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
this is the urethane cast of Mark

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.590 
this is the urethane cast of Mark
Ruffalo's<00:01:36.950> head<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.180> see<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.450> got

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
Ruffalo's head and you can see it's got

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.630 
Ruffalo's head and you can see it's got
detailed<00:01:39.020> down<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.380> poor<00:01:39.950> level<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:40.520> what

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
detailed down to the poor level so what

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.520 
detailed down to the poor level so what
we<00:01:40.760> could<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.120> take<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.780> do<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.260> laser

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
we could do is take this and do a laser

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.960 
we could do is take this and do a laser
scan<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.040> gives<00:01:43.250> us<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.460> higher<00:01:43.670> resolution

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
scan which gives us a higher resolution

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.700 
scan which gives us a higher resolution
model<00:01:44.570> than<00:01:44.690> we<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.840> get<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.200> any<00:01:45.470> other<00:01:45.560> way

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
model than we can get in any other way

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.890 
model than we can get in any other way
and<00:01:46.070> then<00:01:46.880> we<00:01:46.970> hand<00:01:47.120> this<00:01:47.210> off<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.390> Chris<00:01:47.660> Costa

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
and then we hand this off to Chris Costa

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.810 
and then we hand this off to Chris Costa
who<00:01:48.410> then<00:01:48.590> can<00:01:48.920> apply<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.400> Hulk<00:01:49.670> in

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
who then can apply this to Hulk in

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.960 
who then can apply this to Hulk in
ZBrush<00:01:50.150> once<00:01:50.780> in<00:01:50.930> ZBrush<00:01:51.470> I'm<00:01:52.100> able<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.520> use

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
ZBrush once in ZBrush I'm able to use

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.170 
ZBrush once in ZBrush I'm able to use
digital<00:01:53.300> brushes<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:55.430> recreate<00:01:55.880> all<00:01:56.150> the

details so you know just like with

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.850 
details so you know just like with
traditional<00:01:59.150> clay<00:01:59.390> I'm<00:01:59.930> able<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.440> sculpt

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860
