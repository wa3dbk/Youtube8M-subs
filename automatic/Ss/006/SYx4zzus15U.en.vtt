00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
through the outside loops you can work

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.230 
through the outside loops you can work
through<00:01:27.930> both<00:01:28.050> loops<00:01:28.700> whatever<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:30.060> but

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.670 
go across go through the outside two so
you're<00:01:56.940> kind<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.299> going<00:01:57.900> around<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you're kind of just going around in a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.030 
you're kind of just going around in a
circle<00:01:59.510> into<00:02:00.510> each<00:02:00.689> stitch<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.710> come<00:02:02.010> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
circle into each stitch that you come to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.920 
circle into each stitch that you come to
its<00:02:03.000> crossing<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> top<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.810> then

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
its crossing over the top and then

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.749 
its crossing over the top and then
you're<00:02:07.080> going<00:02:07.320> through<00:02:07.740> those<00:02:07.890> two<00:02:08.250> outside

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you're going through those two outside

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.290 
you're going through those two outside
loops<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.099> good<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> keep<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
loops so it's good to keep them if you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.459 
loops so it's good to keep them if you
have

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
have

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.839 
have
pinning<00:02:15.469> if<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.769> have<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> lot<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.549> sew

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
pinning if you have a lot to sew

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.209 
pinning if you have a lot to sew
together<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.599> really<00:02:17.810> big<00:02:17.989> seam<00:02:18.439> you

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
together if it's a really big seam you

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.160 
together if it's a really big seam you
can<00:02:19.400> use<00:02:19.579> like<00:02:19.819> locking<00:02:20.090> stitch<00:02:20.599> markers

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
can use like locking stitch markers

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.410 
can use like locking stitch markers
every<00:02:22.010> few<00:02:22.219> stitches<00:02:22.609> to<00:02:22.640> hold<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.150> right<00:02:23.359> in

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
every few stitches to hold it right in

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.860 
every few stitches to hold it right in
place<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.200> don't<00:02:24.439> have<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.980> try<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.879> guess

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
place so you don't have to try to guess

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.740 
place so you don't have to try to guess
and<00:02:27.170> end<00:02:27.290> up<00:02:27.409> having<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.920> crooked<00:02:28.310> seen<00:02:28.790> it's

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and end up having a crooked seen it's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.839 
and end up having a crooked seen it's
pretty<00:02:29.810> easy<00:02:30.109> seem<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.620> take<00:02:30.799> out<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.370> do

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
pretty easy seem to take out if you do

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.429 
pretty easy seem to take out if you do
make<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.150> crooked<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.750> need<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.019> start<00:02:33.230> it

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
make it crooked and need to start it

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.890 
make it crooked and need to start it
over<00:02:33.560> but<00:02:34.400> once<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.819> get<00:02:34.939> to<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> end<00:02:35.420> just

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
over but once you get to the end just

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.369 
over but once you get to the end just
pull<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.530> nice<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.709> tight<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.840> you'll<00:02:39.170> see

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
pull it nice and tight and you'll see

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.319 
pull it nice and tight and you'll see
that<00:02:39.560> if<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.159> worked<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.639> the<00:02:40.760> green<00:02:41.060> it's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
that if this is worked in the green it's

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.849 
that if this is worked in the green it's
almost<00:02:41.750> invisible<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.799> then<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:43.700> front

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
almost invisible and then on the front

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.530 
almost invisible and then on the front
all<00:02:45.859> you<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.609> little<00:02:47.030> bar<00:02:47.510> that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
all you have is this little bar that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.259 
all you have is this little bar that
shows<00:02:48.230> up<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.639> why<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.819> left<00:02:50.060> those

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
shows up and this is why I left those

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.629 
shows up and this is why I left those
seams<00:02:50.629> on<00:02:50.900> work<00:02:51.139> those<00:02:51.170> loops<00:02:51.980> because<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.400> like

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
seams on work those loops because I like

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.539 
seams on work those loops because I like
the<00:02:52.879> little<00:02:53.060> kind<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.959> bar<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:54.980> get<00:02:55.280> on

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
the little kind of bar that you get on

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.119 
the little kind of bar that you get on
both<00:02:55.730> sides<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:57.169> this<00:02:57.349> isn't<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.709> green<00:02:57.950> it's

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
both sides so this isn't the green it's

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.039 
both sides so this isn't the green it's
gonna<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.370> pretty<00:02:58.549> much<00:02:58.669> invisible<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.780> you

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
gonna be pretty much invisible and you

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.770 
gonna be pretty much invisible and you
can<00:03:00.200> see<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.799> very<00:03:00.829> flat<00:03:01.549> seam<00:03:02.090> it's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
can see that it's a very flat seam it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.099 
can see that it's a very flat seam it's
not<00:03:03.280> too<00:03:04.280> 3-dimensional<00:03:05.239> even<00:03:05.780> though<00:03:05.900> you're

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
not too 3-dimensional even though you're

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.210 
not too 3-dimensional even though you're
going<00:03:06.379> around<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.970> stitches<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.680> doesn't

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
going around the stitches it doesn't

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.729 
going around the stitches it doesn't
really<00:03:10.579> stick<00:03:10.790> out<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.450> much<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.530> it's<00:03:12.590> a

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
really stick out that much so it's a

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.490 
really stick out that much so it's a
really<00:03:12.889> nice<00:03:13.159> seam<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.939> works<00:03:14.299> up<00:03:14.840> really

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
really nice seam it works up really

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.470 
really nice seam it works up really
quickly<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.189> it's<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.430> pretty<00:03:16.609> sturdy<00:03:17.090> seam

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
quickly and it's a pretty sturdy seam

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.689 
quickly and it's a pretty sturdy seam
but<00:03:18.409> that's<00:03:18.590> how<00:03:18.739> you're<00:03:18.949> gonna<00:03:19.040> whip<00:03:19.400> stitch

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
but that's how you're gonna whip stitch

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.909 
but that's how you're gonna whip stitch
along<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.209> V<00:03:20.449> okay<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:20.959> if<00:03:21.199> you<00:03:21.319> need<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.560> work

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
along the V okay so if you need to work

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.479 
along the V okay so if you need to work
along<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.250> bumpy<00:03:23.000> edge<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.690> your<00:03:23.810> project

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
along the bumpy edge of your project

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.930 
along the bumpy edge of your project
this<00:03:26.290> joint<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.470> very<00:03:27.650> easy<00:03:27.919> also<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.849> do

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
this joint is very easy also you just do

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.509 
this joint is very easy also you just do
the<00:03:29.060> same<00:03:29.239> thing<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.590> just<00:03:30.799> start<00:03:31.040> working

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
the same thing you just start working

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.210 
the same thing you just start working
around<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.389> around<00:03:32.470> find<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.620> good<00:03:33.769> spot<00:03:33.919> to

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
around and around find a good spot to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.969 
around and around find a good spot to
put<00:03:34.250> your<00:03:34.639> needle<00:03:35.229> or<00:03:36.229> you<00:03:36.319> can<00:03:36.500> get<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:36.829> nice

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:36.979 
put your needle or you can get some nice

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.189 
put your needle or you can get some nice
loops<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:38.720> many<00:03:39.139> as<00:03:39.379> few<00:03:39.889> as<00:03:39.919> you<00:03:40.069> want

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
loops as many as few as you want

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.039 
loops as many as few as you want
delete<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:43.669> smaller<00:03:44.150> amount<00:03:44.599> of<00:03:44.780> loops

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
delete the the smaller amount of loops

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.140 
delete the the smaller amount of loops
that<00:03:45.199> you<00:03:45.379> catch<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.099> less<00:03:46.280> invisible<00:03:46.970> the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
that you catch the less invisible the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.960 
that you catch the less invisible the
seam<00:03:47.389> will<00:03:47.599> be<00:03:47.780> because<00:03:48.079> obviously<00:03:48.229> if<00:03:48.739> you

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
seam will be because obviously if you

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.219 
seam will be because obviously if you
start<00:03:49.970> catching<00:03:50.150> way<00:03:50.479> down<00:03:50.629> here<00:03:51.019> you're

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
start catching way down here you're

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.339 
start catching way down here you're
gonna<00:03:51.319> have<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.799> funny<00:03:52.519> looking<00:03:52.879> seam<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:54.079> it's

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
gonna have a funny looking seam and it's

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.890 
gonna have a funny looking seam and it's
going<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.650> be<00:03:54.799> quite<00:03:55.040> visible<00:03:55.519> so<00:03:56.329> try<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.569> just

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
going to be quite visible so try to just
