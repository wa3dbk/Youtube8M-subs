00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello everyone with you cooler and stake today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.019
 my first video on this channel I would 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.190
 I wanted to draw your attention to how 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.250
 still increase productivity 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 your non-game pack if you donâ€™t 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.539
 gaming pc and raise the bar fps at least 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 on 5 6 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.750
 generally to start 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.609
 optimization you have to press right 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.769
 click on the desktop 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.019
 you have this leaflet 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.110
 list of any widgets 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.600
 we choose your control panel 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.890
 video card in my case it's on video in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 your case may be 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 and m d and if you have a video card from 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.800
 intel then instead of the control panel will be 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.710
 graphic characteristics written 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.129
 Generally go to the control panel 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 I'll tell you again in my case this video 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.719
 go to adjust settings 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.420
 images from you and choose 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.969
 Customized with a focus on in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.229
 you will be performance and accurate 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.939
 default balance and you bet on 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.420
 performance here we press 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.530
 apply and in that case have you 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.270
 performance will probably grow 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.430
 fps at 5 is one hundred percent 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.060
 maybe someone and more further we 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 move on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 parameter management and here we are too 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.560
 choose the most optimal parameters for 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.560
 performance, that is, disable all 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 that we do not need namely anisotropic 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.950
 filtering vertically sync this 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.240
 In general, we cut everything down and put it here 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.240
 high performance 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.340
 how do you somehow turn everything off too 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.439
 we use it like this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.840
 we don't need anything guys that is 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.479
 boldly close the control panel and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.270
 move on to the next instructor item 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.569
 optimization right click click 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.210
 computer properties additional 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.979
 performance system parameters and 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.790
 set to provide the best 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.519
 speed you certainly have 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.799
 donate to your favorite habitual 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.319
 background all sorts of effect animations 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.260
 but no less performance 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.549
 pretty good gain will give 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.390
 minimum fps 3 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.930
 I guarantee you this let's wait 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.430
 what we can for a long time depending on 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.579
 general characteristics of the computer will be 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.480
 generally apply that I did not long 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:45.069
 changing already pretty one second 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.930
 now he knows everything about us now 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.360
 provide the best speed but 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.299
 as you can see we are very bad 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.150
 In general, the clarity of the screen we have all three 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.370
 Konka here planets inscription site search and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.889
 let's all become much somehow 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.940
 pixel in general on and to this 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.970
 avoid go 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.030
 right click on the desktop 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.780
 personalization and choose windows 7 theme 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.940
 aero 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.889
 that is, we have the best 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.349
 speed but some effects y 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:19.180
 us all rollers are returning to our 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:22.139
 familiar familiar windows 7 too 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.139
 wait now 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.829
 I repeat depending on the filling 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.140
 computer depends on the speed of use 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.299
 data or other topics 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.159
 here is the theme applied to us that is, the effects 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.110
 see no there is everything here 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:48.930
 mentally open here for a share 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.700
 seconds in general, well, I just pumped up 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.780
 all garbage at me yet, even under this 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.120
 Norman even faster would be hampers 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.470
 animation well, in general, you all understand 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.760
 I hope you my lesson will help you all the same 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.859
 learn everything right there for yourself 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.019
 tune up will give you this boost 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.819
 performance and with you there was a cooler 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.680
 stake subscribe to the channel put like 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.680
 see you soon and bye
