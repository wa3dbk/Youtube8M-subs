goes right so you're going to find all
of<00:00:51.789> these<00:00:51.969> battles<00:00:52.449> pretty<00:00:52.719> easy<00:00:52.929> to<00:00:53.170> be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
of these battles pretty easy to be

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.660 
of these battles pretty easy to be
honest<00:00:53.500> if<00:00:53.649> you've<00:00:53.769> got<00:00:53.949> a<00:00:53.980> man-of-war<00:00:54.219> if

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
honest if you've got a man-of-war if

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.799 
honest if you've got a man-of-war if
you've<00:00:54.820> got<00:00:54.940> other<00:00:55.059> stuff<00:00:55.359> it's<00:00:55.539> going<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.719> be

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
you've got other stuff it's going to be

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.090 
you've got other stuff it's going to be
a<00:00:55.839> lot<00:00:56.019> harder<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.410> it's<00:00:56.620> actually<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:56.980> to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
a lot harder and it's actually going to

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.319 
a lot harder and it's actually going to
be<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.190> lot<00:00:57.339> harder<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.640> get<00:00:57.850> through<00:00:58.089> to<00:00:58.239> the

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
be a lot harder to get through to the

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.270 
be a lot harder to get through to the
more<00:00:58.480> difficult<00:00:58.690> routes<00:00:59.260> but<00:00:59.800> eventually<00:01:00.039> you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
more difficult routes but eventually you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.099 
more difficult routes but eventually you
can<00:01:00.460> get<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> diamond<00:01:01.269> sails<00:01:01.570> which<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.019> the

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
can get the diamond sails which is the

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.450 
can get the diamond sails which is the
green<00:01:02.320> sails<00:01:02.679> so<00:01:02.890> it's<00:01:03.010> definitely<00:01:03.280> a<00:01:03.339> good

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
green sails so it's definitely a good

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.189 
green sails so it's definitely a good
reason<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.879> actually<00:01:03.999> do<00:01:04.330> this<00:01:04.540> other<00:01:05.019> than

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
reason to actually do this other than

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.390 
reason to actually do this other than
the<00:01:05.409> fact<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.770> can<00:01:05.890> make<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> lot<00:01:06.370> of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
the fact that you can make a lot of

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.520 
the fact that you can make a lot of
money<00:01:06.610> from<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.000> as<00:01:07.120> well<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:08.260> is<00:01:08.409> the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
money from it as well so this is the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.050 
money from it as well so this is the
gilded<00:01:08.890> Wheel<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.400> actually<00:01:09.580> get<00:01:10.030> from

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
gilded Wheel that you actually get from

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.180 
gilded Wheel that you actually get from
Ken<00:01:10.690> weighs<00:01:10.930> fleet<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.500> is<00:01:11.620> really<00:01:11.980> really

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
Ken weighs fleet and it is really really

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.530 
Ken weighs fleet and it is really really
sick<00:01:12.400> it's<00:01:12.580> probably<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.940> best<00:01:13.090> wheel<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.509> be

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
sick it's probably the best wheel to be

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.060 
sick it's probably the best wheel to be
honest<00:01:13.869> apart<00:01:14.140> from<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.320> death<00:01:14.500> vessel<00:01:14.920> one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070
