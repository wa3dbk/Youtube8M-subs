I'm<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:17.150> big<00:02:17.450> enough<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.530> know<00:02:18.650> for

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
I'm not big enough you know for

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.070 
I'm not big enough you know for
bodybuilding<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.700> now<00:02:19.850> I'm<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.959> know

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
bodybuilding and then now I'm you know

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.470 
bodybuilding and then now I'm you know
like<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.980> cost<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.490> being<00:02:22.610> too<00:02:23.060> big

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
like that on that cost of being too big

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.680 
like that on that cost of being too big
for<00:02:23.780> physique<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.650> right<00:02:25.250> there<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.300> think

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
for physique but right there so I think

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.880 
for physique but right there so I think
there's<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.050> lot<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.349> things<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.680> got<00:02:27.830> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
there's a lot of things that I got a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.309 
there's a lot of things that I got a
really<00:02:28.340> kind<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.700> Brussels<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.599> for<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
really kind of Brussels with for the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.199 
really kind of Brussels with for the
next<00:02:30.590> year<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.010> kind<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.640> fine-tune<00:02:31.849> what<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
next year to kind of fine-tune what I

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.540 
next year to kind of fine-tune what I
need<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:33.110> do<00:02:33.260> well<00:02:33.680> here<00:02:34.340> in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
need to do to actually do well here in

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.580 
need to do to actually do well here in
physique<00:02:34.880> just<00:02:35.330> more<00:02:35.780> about<00:02:35.930> refinement<00:02:36.530> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
physique just more about refinement I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.740 
physique just more about refinement I
think<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.160> opposed<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.640> redoing<00:02:38.510> everything

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
think as opposed to redoing everything

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.360 
think as opposed to redoing everything

it because I think that there's you know

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.500 
it because I think that there's you know
you<00:03:12.440> don't<00:03:12.709> have<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.129> pressure<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.700> always

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
you don't have that pressure of always

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.759 
you don't have that pressure of always
anything<00:03:14.720> bigger<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.260> always<00:03:15.440> having<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.680> get

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
anything bigger and always having to get

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.690 
anything bigger and always having to get
bigger<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.069> sometimes<00:03:16.340> when<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.489> always

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
bigger and sometimes when you always

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.849 
bigger and sometimes when you always
have<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.879> get<00:03:17.120> bigger<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:18.079> don't<00:03:18.260> have<00:03:18.530> as

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
have to get bigger you don't have as

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.699 
have to get bigger you don't have as
much<00:03:19.189> ability<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.329> guess<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:20.599> mean<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.590> can

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
much ability to I guess I mean you can

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.080 
much ability to I guess I mean you can
never<00:03:21.799> get<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.129> true<00:03:22.370> or<00:03:22.549> fine<00:03:22.760> physique

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
never get that true or fine physique

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.210 
never get that true or fine physique
because<00:03:23.480> right<00:03:23.930> because<00:03:24.290> you're<00:03:24.409> chasing<00:03:25.099> it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
because right because you're chasing it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.589 
because right because you're chasing it
you're<00:03:25.370> chasing<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.879> gotta<00:03:26.030> get<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.420> gotta

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
you're chasing I gotta get this I gotta

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.210 
you're chasing I gotta get this I gotta
get<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.079> getting<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.980> kind<00:03:28.190> of

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
get this and getting that you kind of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.860 
get this and getting that you kind of
give<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.700> give<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.970> get<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> little<00:03:29.420> bit<00:03:29.540> so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
give up you give to get a little bit so

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.839 
give up you give to get a little bit so
so<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.709> think<00:03:30.859> it<00:03:31.129> kind<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.459> fun<00:03:31.639> challenge

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
so I think it kind of a fun challenge

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.240 
so I think it kind of a fun challenge
you<00:03:32.599> know<00:03:32.690> life<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.290> about<00:03:33.530> reinventing
