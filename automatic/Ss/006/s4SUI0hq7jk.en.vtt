00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 the main point why the dog is not 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.150
 coming to you on a team to me is me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.400
 met at ninety percent of those 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 people that I just saw on my 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.719
 training sessions and even after our course on 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.139
 The video I see is the same thing called 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.690
 wheel of emotion or are we just now they 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 understand all this how it works you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 call the dog you suits you with 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 second time richer then long stones 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.439
 remember that you need to plow the players 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 well done let go of the dog team walk 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 okay, tass understood that first to you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.770
 came up was some kind of negative the next you 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.230
 call your dog then thinks more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.300
 just a little more come a little longer 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 come to you, too, I ask you to miss 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.530
 some negative suits you all this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 so long approached me now said 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 then okay well done gave a piece and gives 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 spent further on the team walk and so 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 repeats several times and it turns out 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.250
 constant cheat 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 dog does not come to you you start 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 boils annoyed resent him 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 behavior only this dog is suitable 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.010
 your indignation irritation she heard in 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.430
 your voice can be seen your actions 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.890
 eyes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 tank reads it is not if they even 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 glue such a person why give 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.600
 the one who does or unpleasant it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.880
 very much at all and the dog is hiring you that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.439
 command stones can not even perform 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 on other teams there is no 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 lenovo team near equal number there 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.259
 next jerk 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 he lived all annoyed is a jerk though 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.570
 in principle there is a sense the sky is a dog somewhere 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.909
 thought and she just 8 heard that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 there is the most important moment in training 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.780
 dogs that you do not control your 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 emotions you don't control yourself 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 you must completely switch your 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.840
 emotions so that when you work 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 dogs everything was perfect 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.970
 in a pony if the dog behaves well as 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.369
 whatever you boiled inside you're even sincere 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.930
 tame one emotion to another tass 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.030
 negative emotions on positive and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 praise the dog correctly you must 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.320
 dogs explain that she is a clever fellow 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 that she came up and you are happy that she is to 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 we approached how it can be done 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.770
 Well, of course the second point is that you are with 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.990
 require a dog overpriced 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.729
 or you did not explain for the teams this is the moment 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.129
 dog training we are with you now consider 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.080
 moment of emotion because thereâ€™s more 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.390
 just the owner is cut off by those who 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.330
 the owners really know the theory of training 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.250
 but they very often stumble on the moment 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.230
 when could not control myself and not 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.629
 can switch negative to positive 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.170
 for example you feel you are starting 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.760
 boil you start internal so 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.330
 get annoyed you want that god 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.980
 disobeyed 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.260
 The survey does not obey it does not justify 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.450
 your expectations here are such rise you 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.629
 such an inner as he can I with him 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.700
 engaged or not to offend and he sniffs there 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.319
 something and at this moment only you this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.930
 feel you should thats follow and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.959
 say wow and i'm annoyed sheep or i 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.220
 angry and at the same time switch 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.260
 attention to something else 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.959
 unusual about pay attention to the same 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.879
 to positive what can positive 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.400
 First, we will draw attention to it. 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.470
 how glad and thankful I am that dogs 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.390
 I have it as I waited a long time like me 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.819
 long choose such cool cops were 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.950
 somehow it's just like a warm emotion 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.170
 I remember the time of the puppy 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.780
 the moment we went and took it 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.269
 how did you play with him right away 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.159
 similar to streaming to positive and in this 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.349
 positive stage I can continue to work 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.480
 the dog because you know the dog feels 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.940
 your condition is equal to you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 as a dog gnawed happy 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.650
 days vn and if you are for his annoyed 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.239
 the dog will feel this emotion and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.120
 she won't hear you 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.700
 she would have to know that my mother and after Papazol 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.340
 truths the one who can command the dog 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.019
 nose and calm and balanced he knows even 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
 how to behave in any situation 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.220
 and as a leader we will talk for now 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.099
 the most important thing now is for him to learn 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.379
 shout your negative on positive 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.879
 and it is also important to track their negative and 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.409
 when you catch 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.840
 consciously switch and not 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.230
 get annoyed further when you do it 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.300
 further glaze whether 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.209
 and that is, both training is worth two 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.040
 stages 1 of the technique of training and understanding 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.849
 dogs and second your emotional 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.250
 state your homework is you 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.620
 must for two or three days wear on 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.930
 arm thin rezinochku and only your 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.549
 the dog you do not listen to wear not 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.099
 get annoyed first click all 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.590
 rezinochkoy track this by no matter 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.570
 second change it to positive that is 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.220
 remember as well as thankful 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.889
 your dog or borrow in principle 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 something positive about your life and then 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.880
 I think that currently do 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.560
 if after drying the team to me mom 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.810
 learned to clap and run away another 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.539
 side or there is no team nearby 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.220
 think maybe he's tired maybe 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.350
 with very distracting stimuli 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.210
 the dog is spilled or just need 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.699
 meeting she calmed down and turned on 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.500
 brains and maybe the dog is basically tired 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.930
 that she already simply does not hear you 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.880
 controls it is necessary to take home about 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.860
 This speaks more to me now is the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.690
 the main thing that you know how to negative 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.729
 straight with the game the reason is positive 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.729
 and then everything will go easier
