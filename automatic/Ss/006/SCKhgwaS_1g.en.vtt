all right I am going to open the freeze
dryer<00:00:06.840> and<00:00:07.139> check<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.800> batch<00:00:08.220> of

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
dryer and check on a batch of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.160 
dryer and check on a batch of
freeze-dried<00:00:09.210> chili

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
freeze-dried chili

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.600 
freeze-dried chili
I<00:00:10.320> put<00:00:11.190> 12<00:00:12.030> cans<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.690> chili<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.200> there<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.860> 48

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I put 12 cans of chili in there about 48

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.029 
I put 12 cans of chili in there about 48
hours<00:00:14.760> ago<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> lot<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.019> liquid<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
hours ago which is a lot of liquid and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.009 
hours ago which is a lot of liquid and
I've<00:00:17.519> never<00:00:17.730> done<00:00:17.939> that<00:00:18.060> before<00:00:18.240> want<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> see

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:19.019 
I've never done that before want to see

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.439 
I've never done that before want to see
how<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.259> turned<00:00:19.499> out<00:00:19.759> it<00:00:20.759> was<00:00:20.909> indicating<00:00:21.419> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
how it turned out it was indicating that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.089 
how it turned out it was indicating that
it<00:00:21.599> was<00:00:21.630> done<00:00:21.929> so<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.320> put<00:00:22.589> the<00:00:22.710> rocker<00:00:22.919> switch

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
it was done so I put the rocker switch

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
it was done so I put the rocker switch
in<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.669> middle<00:00:23.699> position<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:26.659> there's<00:00:27.659> no

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
in the middle position and there's no

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
in the middle position and there's no
way<00:00:27.989> to<00:00:28.050> open<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.499> door<00:00:28.560> until<00:00:29.550> you've

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
way to open this door until you've

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.489 
way to open this door until you've
released<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> vacuum<00:00:30.720> pressure<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.409> way

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
released the vacuum pressure and the way

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:36.020 
released the vacuum pressure and the way
you<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.829> that<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.759> by<00:00:33.769> turning<00:00:34.769> the<00:00:35.760> drain

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you do that is by turning the drain

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
you do that is by turning the drain
valve<00:00:36.359> counterclockwise<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.469> quarter<00:00:38.010> turn

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
valve counterclockwise a quarter turn

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.299 
valve counterclockwise a quarter turn
now<00:00:39.120> when<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.019> I've<00:00:40.769> already<00:00:41.129> done

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
now when you do that I've already done

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
now when you do that I've already done
it<00:00:41.429> before<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.539> off<00:00:42.719> video<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it before when I was off video so you

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.259 
it before when I was off video so you
would<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.800> normally<00:00:44.250> heard<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.850> rushing

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
would have normally heard the rushing

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.410 
would have normally heard the rushing
sound<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> air<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.649> back<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.429> balancing

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
sound of air going back in and balancing

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
sound of air going back in and balancing
the<00:00:48.510> pressure<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.199> chamber<00:00:49.579> before<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the pressure in the chamber before you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
the pressure in the chamber before you
do<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.089> you<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> make<00:00:51.629> sure<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
do that you want to make sure that the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
do that you want to make sure that the
hose<00:00:52.679> in<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.670> bucket<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.499> not<00:00:55.499> in<00:00:55.800> water<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
hose in your bucket is not in water so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.369 
hose in your bucket is not in water so
empty<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.059> bucket<00:00:57.420> or<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.780> sure<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.170> not

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
empty your bucket or make sure it's not

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
empty your bucket or make sure it's not
touching<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.039> water<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.149> will

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
touching the water or it will

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
touching the water or it will
immediately<00:01:01.190> vacuum<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> water<00:01:02.940> from

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
immediately vacuum all of the water from

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960 
immediately vacuum all of the water from
the<00:01:03.359> bucket<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> freeze<00:01:04.800> dryer<00:01:05.159> right

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the bucket into the freeze dryer right

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.030 
the bucket into the freeze dryer right
where<00:01:06.180> you've<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.360> freeze-dried<00:01:07.260> food<00:01:07.800> so

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
where you've just freeze-dried food so

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.810 
where you've just freeze-dried food so
you<00:01:08.130> don't<00:01:08.160> want<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.560> will

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you don't want to do that so we will

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.170 
you don't want to do that so we will
open<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> freeze<00:01:12.240> dryer<00:01:13.700> take<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.910> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
open the freeze dryer take out this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.500 
open the freeze dryer take out this
insulating<00:01:15.870> pad<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.330> have

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
insulating pad and there we have

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.990 
insulating pad and there we have
freeze-dried<00:01:19.140> chili<00:01:19.500> now<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> checked<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
freeze-dried chili now I checked the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.050 
freeze-dried chili now I checked the
temperature<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.810> minute<00:01:22.410> ago<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.880> always

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
temperature a minute ago and I always

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.640 
temperature a minute ago and I always
like<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.480> this<00:01:24.510> just<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.080> fun<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:27.650> it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
like to do this just for fun it was it

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.480 
like to do this just for fun it was it
was<00:01:28.800> about<00:01:29.070> negative<00:01:29.700> 45<00:01:30.600> degrees<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
was about negative 45 degrees so you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.880 
was about negative 45 degrees so you
could<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.120> I<00:01:33.150> went<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.510> I<00:01:33.930> went<00:01:34.680> down

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
could see there I went up to I went down

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.480 
could see there I went up to I went down
to<00:01:35.190> negative<00:01:37.400> 30<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.640> 40<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.230> negative<00:01:40.500> 38<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to negative 30 or 40 so a negative 38 in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
to negative 30 or 40 so a negative 38 in
some<00:01:41.760> places<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.650> is<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
some places so you can see that is a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.890 
some places so you can see that is a
pretty<00:01:44.310> cold<00:01:44.850> freezer<00:01:47.180> chilly<00:01:48.180> looks<00:01:48.510> great

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
pretty cold freezer chilly looks great

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.080 
pretty cold freezer chilly looks great
looks<00:01:49.440> really<00:01:49.740> dry<00:01:50.010> I'm<00:01:50.400> gonna<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
looks really dry I'm gonna take it in

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080 
looks really dry I'm gonna take it in
the<00:01:51.270> kitchen<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.790> experiment<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:53.940> little

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the kitchen and experiment with a little

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.540 
the kitchen and experiment with a little
bit<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.350> see<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:56.430> ice<00:01:56.730> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:58.050> sides<00:01:58.550> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
bit you can see the ice on the sides and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.420 
bit you can see the ice on the sides and
that<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:01.050> as<00:02:01.260> much<00:02:01.470> ice<00:02:01.830> as<00:02:01.860> I've<00:02:02.250> ever

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that is about as much ice as I've ever

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.720 
that is about as much ice as I've ever
seen<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.750> there<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.800> think<00:02:05.160> I<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.430> pushing

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
seen in there so I think I was pushing

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.600 
seen in there so I think I was pushing
this<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.450> limit<00:02:06.920> but<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.069> will<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> on

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
this to the limit but we will put it on

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.080 
this to the limit but we will put it on
thaw<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.420> defrost<00:02:10.140> cycle<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.790> ready<00:02:11.970> for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
thaw or defrost cycle and get ready for

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.880 
thaw or defrost cycle and get ready for
our<00:02:12.240> next<00:02:12.450> batch

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
our next batch
