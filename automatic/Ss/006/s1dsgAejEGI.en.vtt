to<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.240> character<00:01:58.750> in<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.439> most<00:01:59.590> believable

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
to the character in the most believable

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.140 
to the character in the most believable
way<00:02:00.250> possible

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.630 

it's<00:02:03.690> just<00:02:04.440> kind<00:02:04.620> of<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:04.830> breathing<00:02:05.220> life

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it's just kind of about breathing life

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's just kind of about breathing life
into<00:02:05.670> inanimate<00:02:06.120> objects<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.200> dig<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
into inanimate objects kind of dig that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
into inanimate objects kind of dig that
part<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:10.020> yes<00:02:10.290> we<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.650> done<00:02:10.770> mocap<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
part so yes we have done mocap but the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.850 
part so yes we have done mocap but the
intriguing<00:02:12.360> part<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.930> watching<00:02:13.170> Eric<00:02:13.740> Lee

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
intriguing part is watching Eric Lee

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
intriguing part is watching Eric Lee
show<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> watching<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.580> animators<00:02:15.120> really

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
show and watching the animators really

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.300 
show and watching the animators really
like<00:02:17.210> take<00:02:18.210> take<00:02:19.050> norm<00:02:19.410> take<00:02:19.710> norms<00:02:20.100> based

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
like take take norm take norms based

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.370 
like take take norm take norms based
performance<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> CG<00:02:21.990> character

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
performance and then have a CG character

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.920 
performance and then have a CG character
who<00:02:22.650> obviously<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.520> just<00:02:24.090> over<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> top<00:02:24.660> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
who obviously is just over the top and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260 
who obviously is just over the top and
really<00:02:25.380> giving<00:02:25.770> him<00:02:25.950> life<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:27.000> say

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
really giving him life and really say

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.360 
really giving him life and really say
well<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.960> funny<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.250> even

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
well this is funny but this is even

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.710 
well this is funny but this is even
funnier

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
funnier

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.200 
funnier

I<00:02:33.270> think<00:02:33.720> we're<00:02:34.050> keeping<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> majority<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
I think we're keeping the majority of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.480 
I think we're keeping the majority of
his<00:02:35.160> acting<00:02:35.520> because<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:37.220> who<00:02:38.220> we

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
his acting because that's that's who we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.980 
his acting because that's that's who we
liked<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.090> he<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.510> liked<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.900> he

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
liked and what he and we liked what he

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.150 
liked and what he and we liked what he
did<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.440> he's<00:02:40.530> very<00:02:40.710> funny

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
did and he's very funny

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.500 
did and he's very funny
Wilda<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.210> head<00:02:42.600> nods<00:02:42.840> hand<00:02:43.650> poses<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.510> some

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
Wilda just head nods hand poses and some

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.600 
Wilda just head nods hand poses and some
of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.660> timing<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.260> giving<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.430> bit

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
of the timing and giving a little bit

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.430 
of the timing and giving a little bit
more<00:02:47.670> life<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.720> character<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:49.290> he's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
more life to the character because he's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.050 
more life to the character because he's
such<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> big<00:02:50.460> guy<00:02:50.700> too

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
such a big guy too

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.420 
such a big guy too
compared<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> norm

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.530 

I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.590> lot<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:56.800> people<00:02:57.160> think<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.180> once

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
I think a lot of people think that once

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.810 
I think a lot of people think that once
you<00:02:58.690> capture<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.170> motion<00:02:59.320> it's<00:02:59.800> done<00:03:00.130> but

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
you capture the motion it's done but

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.610 
you capture the motion it's done but
there's<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> lot<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.600> goes<00:03:01.840> into<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
there's a lot that goes into just the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.100 
there's a lot that goes into just the
retargeting<00:03:03.010> making<00:03:03.640> sure<00:03:03.820> posture<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.750> okay

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
retargeting making sure posture is okay

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.200 
retargeting making sure posture is okay
because<00:03:05.440> you're<00:03:05.740> trying<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.070> match<00:03:06.280> bones<00:03:06.940> and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
because you're trying to match bones and
