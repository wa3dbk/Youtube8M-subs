the color assignment for week 2 we need

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.579 
the color assignment for week 2 we need
to<00:00:02.370> create<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.270> illusion<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.750> transparency

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
to create the illusion of transparency

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.010 
to create the illusion of transparency
by<00:00:04.740> mixing<00:00:05.190> two<00:00:05.250> colors<00:00:05.759> together<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.450> the

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
by mixing two colors together and the

by mixing two colors together and the
way<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.200> do<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.900> use<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.290> blend<00:00:10.650> tool

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
way to do that is to use the blend tool

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.550 
undo move to move that back so now you
have<00:02:22.019> all<00:02:22.260> these<00:02:22.409> separate<00:02:22.799> pieces<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.560> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
have all these separate pieces and you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420 
have all these separate pieces and you
can<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.980> change<00:02:26.250> these<00:02:26.670> ones<00:02:27.470> okay<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.340> we

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
can just change these ones okay but we

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.119 
can just change these ones okay but we
still<00:02:29.459> need<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.870> blended<00:02:31.319> color<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:31.920> how<00:02:32.069> do

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
still need the blended color so how do

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.399 
still need the blended color so how do
we<00:02:32.220> get<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> blended<00:02:32.849> colors<00:02:33.209> well<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
we get the blended colors well the

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:35.599 
we get the blended colors well the
easiest<00:02:34.439> way<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.859> do<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.159> is<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> use<00:02:35.579> the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
easiest way to do that is to use the

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.360 
easiest way to do that is to use the
blend<00:02:35.970> tool<00:02:36.170> will<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.379> blend<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.980> our<00:02:38.189> two
