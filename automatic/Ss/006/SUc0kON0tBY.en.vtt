00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.500 
gobbler and then eventually pucker like
that<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.580> i'm<00:02:25.640> going<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.849> do<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.390> way

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
that so i'm going to do that all the way

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:41.979 
that so i'm going to do that all the way
along<00:02:39.040> okay<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.100> now<00:02:40.549> we<00:02:40.610> stitched<00:02:41.150> we've<00:02:41.780> put

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
along okay so now we stitched we've put

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.720 
along okay so now we stitched we've put
the<00:02:42.110> elastic<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.069> can<00:02:43.190> see<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.430> it's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the elastic in and you can see that it's

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.440 
the elastic in and you can see that it's
got<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:43.970> nice<00:02:44.120> pucker<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.989> way<00:02:45.080> down<00:02:46.450> so

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
got a nice pucker all the way down so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.539 
got a nice pucker all the way down so
now<00:02:47.600> i'm<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:47.840> going<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.140> stretch<00:02:48.830> it<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
now i'm just going to stretch it so the

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.440 
now i'm just going to stretch it so the
ends<00:02:49.910> curl<00:02:51.610> i'm<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.790> going<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.180> all

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
ends curl i'm just going to do that all

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.220 
ends curl i'm just going to do that all
along<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:53.870> both<00:02:54.049> sides<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.930> do<00:02:57.110> this

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
along on both sides you can do this

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.839 
along on both sides you can do this
before<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:58.190> i<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.989> prefer<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.200> do<00:03:00.319> it<00:03:00.349> after

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
before but i just prefer to do it after

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.600 
before but i just prefer to do it after
it's<00:03:01.849> all<00:03:01.970> done<00:03:02.000> that<00:03:02.450> side<00:03:05.890> if<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.130> want<00:03:07.370> to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
it's all done that side if you want to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.960 
it's all done that side if you want to
you<00:03:07.819> can<00:03:08.060> actually<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:08.840> uh<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> ahem<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.760> i

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
you can actually so uh so ahem but i

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.539 
you can actually so uh so ahem but i
just<00:03:11.420> think<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.630> makes<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.079> bit<00:03:12.260> more

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
just think it makes it a bit more

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:18.250 
just think it makes it a bit more
chunkier<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:14.530> doesnt<00:03:15.530> sit<00:03:16.489> as<00:03:16.670> nice<00:03:17.200> ok<00:03:18.200> so

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
chunkier and doesnt sit as nice ok so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.390 
chunkier and doesnt sit as nice ok so
now<00:03:19.180> i'm<00:03:20.180> going<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.390> fold<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:20.840> half<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:22.250> can

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
now i'm going to fold it in half you can

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.640 
now i'm going to fold it in half you can
see<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:22.700> already<00:03:22.819> start<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.269> take<00:03:23.540> shape<00:03:24.220> and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
see it's already start to take shape and

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.099 
see it's already start to take shape and
i<00:03:28.540> only<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.230> elastic<00:03:30.799> I've<00:03:31.010> left<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:32.450> gap<00:03:32.900> on

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
i only so the elastic I've left a gap on

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.830 
i only so the elastic I've left a gap on
each<00:03:33.260> side<00:03:34.030> what<00:03:35.030> I'm<00:03:35.150> going<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.359> do<00:03:35.569> is<00:03:35.690> I'm

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
each side what I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.610 
each side what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:36.079> to<00:03:36.260> cut<00:03:37.209> thin<00:03:38.209> strips<00:03:38.510> just<00:03:39.500> to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
just going to cut thin strips just to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.500 
just going to cut thin strips just to
make<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.799> more<00:03:39.920> childlike<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.120> I'll<00:03:41.450> just

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
make it more childlike so I'll just

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.530 
make it more childlike so I'll just
double<00:03:42.290> them<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.680> it's<00:03:42.859> a<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:44.060> they're<00:03:44.239> pretty

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
double them so it's a so they're pretty

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.830 
double them so it's a so they're pretty
much<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.780> same<00:03:45.139> with<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.500> part<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:46.840> luckily

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
much the same with the part and luckily

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.590 
much the same with the part and luckily
as<00:03:48.139> this<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.500> striped<00:03:49.130> fabric<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.970> easier<00:03:50.450> to

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
as this is striped fabric it's easier to

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.740 
as this is striped fabric it's easier to
cut<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.680> I'm<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.160> cut<00:03:52.660> from<00:03:53.660> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
cut so I'm just going to cut from the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.550 
cut so I'm just going to cut from the
bottom<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:55.130> date<00:03:55.760> about<00:03:56.060> 10<00:03:56.420> centimeters<00:03:56.720> and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
bottom I date about 10 centimeters and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.020 
bottom I date about 10 centimeters and
I'm<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.459> cut<00:03:59.239> the<00:03:59.889> strips<00:04:00.889> about<00:04:01.040> an

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'm going to cut the strips about an

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:15.740 
I'm going to cut the strips about an
inch<00:04:02.209> apart<00:04:03.100> for<00:04:04.100> just<00:04:04.549> literally<00:04:04.970> like<00:04:05.150> that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.460 

I'll<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:17.079> that<00:04:17.109> all<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.440> way<00:04:17.560> along<00:04:19.410> okay<00:04:20.410> so

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
I'll do that all the way along okay so

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.580 
I'll do that all the way along okay so
I've<00:04:21.130> done<00:04:21.310> than<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.450> and<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:22.930> now<00:04:22.960> all<00:04:23.200> i'm

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
I've done than that and so now all i'm

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.290 
I've done than that and so now all i'm
going<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.800> do<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:23.980> just<00:04:24.130> pull<00:04:24.490> them<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.880> you

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
going to do is just pull them and you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.330 
going to do is just pull them and you
can<00:04:25.450> see<00:04:25.720> once<00:04:26.080> I<00:04:26.260> pull<00:04:26.560> them<00:04:26.770> they<00:04:26.889> make<00:04:27.100> they

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
can see once I pull them they make they

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.300 
can see once I pull them they make they
kill<00:04:27.610> round<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.180> just<00:04:28.360> looks<00:04:28.540> quite<00:04:28.750> nice

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
kill round and it just looks quite nice

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:39.920 
kill round and it just looks quite nice
I'm<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.550> do<00:04:30.700> that<00:04:30.910> with<00:04:31.620> both<00:04:32.620> sides<00:04:32.919> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.530 

then<00:04:40.930> once<00:04:41.080> you've<00:04:41.260> done
