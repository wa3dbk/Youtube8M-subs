let's get on with the video so when I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
let's get on with the video so when I
first<00:00:18.720> found<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.260> ethos<00:00:19.770> storage<00:00:20.160> room<00:00:20.310> I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
first found out I ethos storage room I

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700 
first found out I ethos storage room I
thought<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.470> hard

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
thought it was going to be really hard

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.820 
thought it was going to be really hard
when<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.670> look<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> chests<00:00:25.320> opening

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
when you look at all the chests opening

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.450 
when you look at all the chests opening
but<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.720> not<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> hard<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
but it's not actually that hard when you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
but it's not actually that hard when you
think<00:00:29.670> guys<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:29.960> stands<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.080> pressure

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
think guys just stands and pressure

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.520 
think guys just stands and pressure
plate<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.859> activates<00:00:32.989> simple<00:00:33.989> secretary

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
plate and activates simple secretary

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.450 
plate and activates simple secretary
really<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.760> flip-flop<00:00:37.460> really

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really it's just a a flip-flop really

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.330 
really it's just a a flip-flop really
this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.899> quick<00:00:40.140> simple<00:00:40.559> one<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> find

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
this is a just a quick simple one I find

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.209 
this is a just a quick simple one I find
easy<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.790> make<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:43.800> leads<00:00:43.980> into

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
easy to make and it just leads into

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.500 
easy to make and it just leads into
repeaters<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.120> easy<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.510> it's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
repeaters it's easy to make and it's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
repeaters it's easy to make and it's
easy<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.930> tile<00:00:49.940> meaning<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.770> actually

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
easy to tile meaning you can go actually

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.310 
easy to tile meaning you can go actually
the<00:00:52.920> meaning<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.149> carry<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the meaning you can carry on going all

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
the meaning you can carry on going all
across<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.719> big<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
across so you can make it as big as you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.639 
across so you can make it as big as you
want<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.109> ethos

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
want but you know it's it's just ethos

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.329 
want but you know it's it's just ethos
storage<00:01:01.980> room<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.640> quite<00:01:02.789> small<00:01:03.180> so

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
storage room really it's quite small so

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
storage room really it's quite small so

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.089 
I've built this a bit wrong this all
needs<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.480> layer<00:02:40.780> down<00:02:41.109> apart<00:02:42.010> from

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
needs to be one layer down apart from

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.500 
needs to be one layer down apart from
the<00:02:42.219> Redstone<00:02:42.639> you<00:02:42.790> need<00:02:42.969> the<00:02:43.090> Redstone

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
the Redstone you need the Redstone

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.129 
the Redstone you need the Redstone
dipping<00:02:44.349> down<00:02:44.590> one<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.280> into<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.909> because

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
dipping down one and into this because

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:51.629 
dipping down one and into this because
this<00:02:47.139> is<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:49.919> this<00:02:50.919> block<00:02:51.159> is<00:02:51.189> going<00:02:51.519> to

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
this is going to this block is going to

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.069 
this is going to this block is going to
push<00:02:51.970> upwards<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:53.590> when<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:53.829> walk<00:02:54.010> over<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
push upwards so when you walk over it

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.619 
push upwards so when you walk over it
you<00:02:56.079> know<00:02:56.819> goes<00:02:57.819> over<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.329> then<00:02:58.419> you<00:02:58.510> got<00:02:58.599> your

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
you know goes over and then you got your
