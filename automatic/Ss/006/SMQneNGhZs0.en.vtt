00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
Black Widow which is not that great I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.440 
Black Widow which is not that great I
think<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> major<00:01:41.369> character<00:01:41.670> Lego<00:01:42.240> should

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
think for a major character Lego should

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
think for a major character Lego should
definitely<00:01:43.079> done<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> different<00:01:43.619> face<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.979> her

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
definitely done a different face for her

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.780 
definitely done a different face for her
I<00:01:44.340> mean<00:01:45.210> Lois<00:01:45.390> Lane<00:01:45.689> deserves<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.200> own<00:01:46.350> face

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790

I mean Lois Lane deserves your own face
and<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> that's<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.740> figures<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.720> let<00:01:52.500> us<00:01:52.790> move
