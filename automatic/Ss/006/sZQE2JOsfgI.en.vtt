00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.700
 then the lords of today's victory in the members of the choir in this spirit of 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 browser to talk about implementation and more precisely food - speak 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.049
 navigation to it 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.500
 so to begin let's fight for objective and definition keywords 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.880
 of the term navigation so basically navigate the location it however 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.619
 couple 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.439
 or is knowing where you are where you have as you can get up to 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.499
 over there 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:33.449
 but continuing hatianos aerial navigation reproduction we can see that 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.100
 our beloved air navigation were divided with submitted 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.059
 The first of these is the visual navigation which also called navigation by 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.929
 account of robbery practiced 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.759
 this type of navigation is one that uses visual interests culture 

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.870
 our terrestrial surface 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.110
 like for example railroads highways lakes northern rivers in sines 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.310
 city ​​rose 7 September 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.580
 this type of navigation most used by beginners in spinning results 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.850
 the private sector because it is characterized mainly because it is not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.930
 necessary the use of on-board instruments of this type of navigation 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 in personal navigation you will get annoyed only by the visual or 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.290
 whether you will look out of the plane will be vetoed by the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.240
 leftover 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 so we still have here in the second type of navigation what is the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.060
 navigating this model this type of navigation we will make use of the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.609
 staff are defects too that the civil abuse and the speedometer and the clock 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.680
 then considering these three films that together with the direction and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.439
 distances formed from a certain point of having known you 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.320
 can thus make your navigation conditional 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.520
 for example knowing that you act in the sector in one of doctors in the conclusions and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.010
 observing the speed you keep the speedometer that is great to 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.130
 distance you will fly over the city is fueled by fred you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.330
 always wanted to do this in life are estimated to find out what time 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.810
 estimated that you will take until you reach the city lives and obviously this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.090
 estimated time to get involved xepa of the museum tam period clock 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.419
 and continues - we have only four titles 

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.779
 the radio navigation that would have to be injured criminal was arrested in the midfield 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.060
 that the interpretation of dials of the panel which indicated the 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.059
 direction of radio waves emitted by the minor lesions 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.019
 other type of navigation and the electronic navigation that will also know that the 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.549
 computers collected electronics 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.959
 the next type of navigation in astronomical navigation also 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.239
 known as celestial navigation is the type of navigation you use 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.329
 external jesus light as reference 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.040
 and last but not least we have here our navigation by 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.010
 satellite rita explains this kind of navigation only needs two books 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.029
 s 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:54.859
 so gentlemen, but let's go ahead and start playing boating 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.290
 we have to learn the system called the coordinate system 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.309
 flanks 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.919
 and want to review this concept we will review something you should have seen 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.259
 his 6th grade elementary school 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:10.359
 so let's start to make a system of plane coordinates but we will 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.669
 get the fruit given very nice and now we will grow a series here 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.669
 of horizontal lines that a series of vertical lines 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.230
 we will take a decision from the Israeli authorities to identify disturbances 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.439
 and now let's list 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.079
 and now with the plan set but we will do 2 with the team 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.270
 I'll stay right here. 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.880
 I'm still beautiful 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.060
 so that if you get involved every year we can see that we can give a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.320
 more coordinate location for each of the two points so let's look at 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.570
 that the naming of the y-axis exercise we will find the coordinates does not have 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.570
 been punctual but we have here is coordinated with a psychologist 2 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.379
 and in the case of the old port we are doing nothing 3 comma four a thing 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.809
 important in this case we do not confuse the naming of the axes 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:02.969
 so for example aquino score but we can not confuse the coordinates 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.969
 with chapter 2 points the secret some 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:09.950
 then it is important that you are younger and by which of the two sexes you go 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:14.529
 begin to be coordinated so let's continue beyond our location 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:19.590
 it is also important that we determine in a coalition in a direction to follow 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.880
 he stood out in associating our direction with your doctor to the point where 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.099
 we will use the put a collar of 3 020 360 degrees 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.379
 starting from scratch but even today we can say that in this 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:36.139
 if we have 45 degrees 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.529
 then only with will be our direction of the br 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.019
 however vaccination but we got here from the program will be moved 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:47.019
 years facet to the high point 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.240
 good not totally 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.770
 one thing we have to go through musicals that we always have to 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.670
 move the arrow in the opposite direction then in this case 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:00.809
 other side 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.549
 so the process means to us already know who smokes found in the 

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:07.430
 Nothing like that was our direction. 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.839
 and so far everything is very easy right? 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.039
 helium for now 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.789
 matt reeves gentlemen one day if they will still feel lack of driving the 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.120
 navigation was so easy as 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.310
 so if the defense asked the Qaddafi 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.520
 then this should be of many different species more agility
