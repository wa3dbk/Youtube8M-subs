intuitive to use and the hardware was
straightforward<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.259> install<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.459> have

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
straightforward to install I would have

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.309 
straightforward to install I would have
liked<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.819> have<00:01:50.880> seen<00:01:51.119> GPS<00:01:51.719> feature<00:01:51.929> built

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
liked to have seen GPS feature built

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.319 
liked to have seen GPS feature built
into<00:01:52.499> it<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.130> plot<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.700> trip<00:01:53.969> on<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
into it so I could plot my trip on the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840 
into it so I could plot my trip on the
map<00:01:54.539> also<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.950> live<00:01:56.189> writer<00:01:56.459> uses<00:01:56.819> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
map also because live writer uses a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.389 
map also because live writer uses a
proprietary<00:01:57.060> software<00:01:58.189> integrating<00:01:59.189> things

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
proprietary software integrating things

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.069 
proprietary software integrating things
like<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> GPS<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.359> what<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.539> was<00:02:00.749> hoping<00:02:00.869> for

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
like the GPS or what I was hoping for

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.109 
like the GPS or what I was hoping for
maybe<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.499> heart<00:02:01.859> rate<00:02:01.979> monitor<00:02:02.039> would<00:02:03.029> have

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
maybe a heart rate monitor would have

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.609 
maybe a heart rate monitor would have
been<00:02:03.240> ideal<00:02:03.420> maybe<00:02:03.990> we'll<00:02:04.109> see<00:02:04.289> that<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.499> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
been ideal maybe we'll see that in the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.559 
been ideal maybe we'll see that in the
next<00:02:04.740> version<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.849> for<00:02:06.119> cyclists

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
next version but for cyclists

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.630 
next version but for cyclists

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
trails

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.769 
trails
