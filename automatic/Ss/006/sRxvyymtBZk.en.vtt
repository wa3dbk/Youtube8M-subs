00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.450 
it I didn't do on the water line because
i<00:01:46.420> think<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.750> would<00:01:46.840> irritate<00:01:47.050> my<00:01:47.470> hi<00:01:47.650> i<00:01:48.070> just

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
i think that would irritate my hi i just

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.520 
i think that would irritate my hi i just
put<00:01:48.880> it<00:01:48.970> on<00:01:49.090> top<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.870> i<00:01:49.960> guess<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.290> could<00:01:50.410> do

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
put it on top and i guess you could do

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.290 
put it on top and i guess you could do
on<00:01:50.710> bottom<00:01:51.070> for<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.280> smokey<00:01:51.700> eye<00:01:51.730> look<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.450> yeah
