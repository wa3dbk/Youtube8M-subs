00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 is the Guatemalan economy and the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000
 way how is the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.319
 government of otto pérez molina invite 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.179
 to the president of the world bank for 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.540
 Central America he is felipe jaramillo 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.309
 felipe a pleasure to greet you and I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.929
 I want to ask you first this is the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.330
 week in which the balance was made 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 the successes and failures of the government 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 of the president of otto pérez molina 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.330
 which would you highlight in this each of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.330
 these columns and why welcome 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:36.270
 see if it has been a year I think he 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.840
 of important advance 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 I would say penalty 3 that they call me 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 the first attention has been 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.660
 approved a tax reform 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.150
 to produce greater income to the state 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.430
 Guatemalan this is something very important 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.120
 it takes a long time the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.120
 state needs fiscal resources so much 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.940
 for the social issue, the programs of 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.130
 health education as for the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.390
 mathematical infrastructure that is 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.840
 quite lagged in another breakthrough in 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 the government has dedicated itself to 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.010
 some important improvements in the subject 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.220
 of competitiveness to improve the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.500
 operation of the entrepreneurs 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.110
 attract investments this year for example 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.560
 in the ranking of doing bussiness 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.140
 guatemala improved five places one of 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.170
 the few Latin American countries that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 they had a significant improvement and this 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.640
 shows an improvement in competitiveness 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.530
 and finally I would tell you something that you notice in 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.049
 this conference yesterday and today 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.200
 what is being discussed has begun 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.830
 to discuss a growth strategy 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.409
 long-term led by the secretary 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.510
 of government planning the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.310
 president otto pérez 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.470
 and this is so important because 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.890
 Guatemala has lacked much have a 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.590
 medium and long-term vision for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.920
 concentrate your efforts what would you be 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.500
 you are let's say the strengths for 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 approach what kind of scenario of 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 economic growth from when 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.010
 taking into account felipe that we are 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.710
 talking about a 2013 a little bit more 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.570
 complicated than 2012 for several countries 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.310
 of the region because they have just 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.070
 the fiscal coffers a little bit more 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.760
 tight that in the years let's say the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.760
 financial crisis 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.760
 it's true they had a 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:43.670
 acceptable economic behavior in the 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 2012 with a growth rate of one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.840
 little more than 3% an organization of 5% 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.760
 this has always been positive guatemala 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.519
 It is characterized as an economy of 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.680
 stable growth yes much more stable 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.280
 that the rest of the region for this 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.290
 next year in guatemala will have the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.680
 lucky that the tax reform is going to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.500
 generate some additional income and 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.590
 I think there are quite a few challenges in the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.129
 use of these resources because guatemala 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.970
 still needs investment 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.159
 in human capital education on issues of 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.439
 malnutrition is where Guatemala still 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.109
 it goes very wrong you know just above 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.450
 of haiti in latin america 'on the subject 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.980
 of chronic malnutrition and after 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.680
 comes the fat topic of 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.090
 very developed infrastructure in 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.950
 Guatemala 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.190
 the world bank studies show 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.710
 that the costs 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.380
 export the guatemala product are 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.230
 lower 40% of the value of the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.630
 production in transportation and the saccade 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.520
 to the body this shows that the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 roads are not in good condition that 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.910
 there are many logistics costs are 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.300
 they lose up to 40 42 percent of the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.860
 perishable products we think there 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.960
 that invest a lot 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.180
 and that investment environment 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.790
 I ask because we will listen soon 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.160
 in a few days the new edition of 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.860
 competitiveness report that prepares 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.440
 the global economic forum but we know 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.810
 that within those obstacles more 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.240
 cited in this global survey that is 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.520
 well from which this index comes out 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.260
 the most important issues that are a 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.120
 ballast for the government for the country 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.420
 for the economy and the Guatemalans are 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.730
 the crime the theft corruption what 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.550
 you have quoted that this offer is very 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.540
 inadequate infrastructure and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.050
 bureaucracy 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.440
 there goes to my question also 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.690
 I think the government understands well is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.310
 these problems and I think it's fine 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.260
 in focus 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.650
 they are doing down 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.540
 the issue of citizen security we have 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.640
 seen that for the third consecutive year has 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.270
 fallen the rate of the equilibria that's 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.970
 favorable there is still much to be done 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.040
 we have seen in this to eliminate paperwork and 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.470
 bureaucracy there are some efforts that already 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:17.370
 they are paying off and we did not tell each other 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.220
 a really interesting initiative 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.700
 Yesterday President Perez delivered the 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.280
 Congress 9 laws to promote employment 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.890
 and investment and this is important 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.490
 because guatemala has always had some 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.950
 excessive costs to employ 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.870
 young people in the formal sector but in the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.800
 informality rate of employment in 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.110
 guatemala is still more quiet in 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.700
 70% almost two thirds of those of 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.710
 the people who work in Guatemala do not 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.230
 has benefits we are out of the 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.140
 legality although with these laws is 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.850
 looking for flexibility and facilitating 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.830
 generation of employment that is well 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.000
 important for the Guatemalan over 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.590
 all young people 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.640
 Well, the owner of this interview 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.950
 it seems that a year after arriving 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.450
 otto pérez molina at the moment the balance 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.920
 if it is with many challenges but it is a 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.260
 positive balance that is being routed 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.120
 towards development initiatives so 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.760
 that we understand felipe jaramillo director 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.780
 of the World Bank for Central America 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.120
 thank you felipe for this evaluation 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.420
 gladly good good night 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.420
 nights
