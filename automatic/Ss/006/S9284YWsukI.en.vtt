00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
game it just it felt like it was the

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.300 
game it just it felt like it was the
same<00:06:43.140> game<00:06:43.410> I've<00:06:43.590> been<00:06:43.620> playing<00:06:43.770> for<00:06:44.280> years

same game I've been playing for years
and<00:06:45.890> by<00:06:46.890> the<00:06:46.950> looks<00:06:47.220> of<00:06:47.340> things<00:06:47.490> it<00:06:47.670> seems<00:06:47.940> like

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
and by the looks of things it seems like

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.410 
and by the looks of things it seems like
this<00:06:48.540> very<00:06:48.750> well<00:06:48.990> as<00:06:49.320> well<00:06:49.650> could<00:06:49.920> just<00:06:50.130> be

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
this very well as well could just be

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.850

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
it's more of the same now is that going

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.900 
it's more of the same now is that going
to<00:06:57.720> be<00:06:57.810> a<00:06:57.840> bad<00:06:58.200> thing<00:06:58.260> if<00:06:58.710> they<00:06:58.860> truly<00:06:59.190> do<00:06:59.490> nail

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
to be a bad thing if they truly do nail

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.970

what<00:07:00.510> they're<00:07:00.690> doing<00:07:00.720> is<00:07:01.080> it<00:07:01.290> is<00:07:01.470> it<00:07:01.680> going<00:07:01.830> to

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
what they're doing is it is it going to

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.740 
what they're doing is it is it going to
be<00:07:02.100> good<00:07:02.370> is<00:07:02.640> it<00:07:02.820> going<00:07:02.910> to<00:07:03.030> be<00:07:03.150> better<00:07:03.420> or
