so<00:00:25.440> now<00:00:25.620> we<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.950> take<00:00:26.100> our<00:00:26.160> paper<00:00:26.520> template

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
so now we can take our paper template

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.510 
so now we can take our paper template
and<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.600> can<00:00:27.720> lay<00:00:27.870> it<00:00:27.900> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> wood<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
and we can lay it on the wood and make a

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.790 
and we can lay it on the wood and make a
mark<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.030> a<00:00:30.570> cutting<00:00:30.869> edge<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> bevel

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
mark with a cutting edge and the bevel

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
mark with a cutting edge and the bevel
on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> tool<00:00:32.279> as<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.120> wood<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.450> field<00:00:33.690> aware

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
on the tool as the wood is field aware

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.660 
on the tool as the wood is field aware
that<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.350> bevel<00:00:34.650> is<00:00:34.770> writing<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> wood

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
that the bevel is writing on the wood

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.120 
that the bevel is writing on the wood
and<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.360> produces<00:00:36.840> these<00:00:36.960> nice<00:00:37.230> long<00:00:37.590> curls

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
and it produces these nice long curls

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:49.010 
and it produces these nice long curls
and<00:00:38.400> leaves<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.760> real<00:00:39.000> nice<00:00:39.300> surface<00:00:39.720> behind<00:00:40.200> it

rim<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.820> going<00:02:22.150> down<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.420> pencil<00:02:22.960> mark

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
rim now going down to that pencil mark

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.760 
rim now going down to that pencil mark
there<00:02:23.290> we<00:02:23.380> go

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
there we go

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.650 
there we go
just<00:02:24.130> give<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> little<00:02:24.520> tap<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
just give it a little tap that is the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.810 
just give it a little tap that is the
MDF<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> little<00:02:26.830> tap<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> ways<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
MDF with a little tap on the ways of the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.080 
MDF with a little tap on the ways of the
lathe<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> that'll<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.540> pop<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.960> bowl<00:02:29.110> lab

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.640 

so<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:34.240> we<00:02:34.360> have<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> turn<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.170> recess

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
so all we have to do is turn a recess

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
so all we have to do is turn a recess
that<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:36.490> fit<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> back<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.330> clock<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
that will fit the back of the clock and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.270 
that will fit the back of the clock and
will<00:02:38.020> expose<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.380> face<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:38.950> then<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.130> can

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
will expose the face and then we can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.800 
will expose the face and then we can
shape<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.550> wood<00:02:39.820> however<00:02:40.209> we<00:02:40.420> would<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
shape the wood however we would like to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.170 
shape the wood however we would like to
the<00:02:41.140> clock<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:42.040> then<00:02:42.220> I'll<00:02:42.370> border<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.970> call

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
the clock and then I'll border the call

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.690 
the clock and then I'll border the call
with<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> bead<00:02:43.990> on<00:02:44.230> each<00:02:44.380> side<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:45.310> for<00:02:45.520> some

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
with a bead on each side just for some

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.750 
with a bead on each side just for some
detail<00:02:46.290> once<00:02:47.290> we<00:02:47.470> get<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:47.830> recess<00:02:48.310> turned<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
detail once we get this recess turned to

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.210 
detail once we get this recess turned to
the<00:02:48.850> right<00:02:49.030> size<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:50.350> back<00:02:50.590> portion<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.130> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the right size the back portion of the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.660 
the right size the back portion of the
clock<00:02:51.459> should<00:02:51.760> fit<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.240> the<00:02:52.330> recess<00:02:52.720> snugly

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
clock should fit in the recess snugly

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.640 
clock should fit in the recess snugly
will<00:02:54.670> use<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> bevel<00:02:55.510> rubbing<00:02:55.900> shear<00:02:56.170> cut<00:02:56.410> here
