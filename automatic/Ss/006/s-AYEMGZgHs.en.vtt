people need to be informed about it I
recently<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.390> learned<00:01:13.630> about<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:15.580> years

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
recently just learned about it two years

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.140 
recently just learned about it two years
ago<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.010> don't<00:01:18.250> take<00:01:18.670> matters<00:01:19.000> into

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
ago and if we don't take matters into

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.410 
ago and if we don't take matters into
our<00:01:19.270> hands<00:01:19.510> now<00:01:19.630> then<00:01:20.080> there'll<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.770> no<00:01:20.980> future

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
our hands now then there'll be no future

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740 
our hands now then there'll be no future
come<00:01:22.420> reopen<00:01:22.840> uh<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.400> that<00:01:24.940> they<00:01:25.150> they

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.320 
come reopen uh I think that they they
tend<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.050> use<00:01:26.290> it<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.560> scare<00:01:27.010> tactics<00:01:27.760> similar

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
tend to use it and scare tactics similar

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.840 
tend to use it and scare tactics similar
what<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.660> do<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:28.870> terrorism<00:01:29.230> but<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.520> all

what you do with terrorism but in all
reality<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.360> mean<00:01:31.630> who<00:01:32.200> doesn't<00:01:32.440> think<00:01:32.650> it's<00:01:32.800> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
reality I mean who doesn't think it's a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.020 
reality I mean who doesn't think it's a
good<00:01:32.890> idea<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.220> recycle<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.760> who<00:01:33.880> doesn't
