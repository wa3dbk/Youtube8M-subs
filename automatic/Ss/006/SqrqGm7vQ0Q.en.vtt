seconds<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.100> go<00:00:38.160> away<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> it's

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
seconds and then it will go away so it's

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
seconds and then it will go away so it's
not<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> stays<00:00:41.879> there<00:00:42.120> like

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
not like this that it stays there like

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
not like this that it stays there like
the<00:00:42.480> whole<00:00:42.510> game<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.670> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the whole game it's not like that so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
the whole game it's not like that so
it's<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.989> goes<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.500> seconds<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> goes

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's it goes for two seconds it goes

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.040 
it's it goes for two seconds it goes
away<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.940> then<00:00:48.120> maybe<00:00:48.239> five<00:00:48.539> seconds<00:00:48.870> later

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
away and then maybe five seconds later

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.740 
away and then maybe five seconds later
does<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> again<00:00:49.770> another<00:00:50.190> spot<00:00:50.579> mark<00:00:50.850> states

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
does it again another spot mark states

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.389 
does it again another spot mark states
for<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.020> seconds<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.590> that's<00:00:52.800> okay<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.190> they

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
for two seconds so that's okay so they

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.130 
for two seconds so that's okay so they
so<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:53.910> fixed<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.629> everyone<00:00:55.050> in

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so they fixed that because everyone in

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
so they fixed that because everyone in
the<00:00:55.289> beta<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.829> complaining<00:00:56.219> about<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the beta was complaining about this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
the beta was complaining about this
hopefully<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.719> fix<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.050> c-4<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
hopefully they fix the c-4 is because I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
hopefully they fix the c-4 is because I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
little small minds and and the beta this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
little small minds and and the beta this
beta<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.369> didn't<00:01:14.610> blink<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
beta right here they didn't blink so it

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.149 
beta right here they didn't blink so it
was<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:15.960> hard<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> even<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
was really hard to see and even if they

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.130 
was really hard to see and even if they
did<00:01:17.220> blink<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.090> Killzone<00:01:18.540> 2<00:01:18.659> they<00:01:19.020> would

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
did blink and like Killzone 2 they would

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.289 
did blink and like Killzone 2 they would
blink<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.520> hard<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
blink it was still hard to see a lot of

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 
blink it was still hard to see a lot of
people<00:01:21.420> would<00:01:21.659> die<00:01:21.810> by<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.439> hopefully

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
people would die by them so hopefully

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
people would die by them so hopefully
they<00:01:22.920> fixed<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> police<00:01:24.689> made<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
they fixed it like the police made it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
they fixed it like the police made it
bigger<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.340> see<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.970> no

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bigger so people can actually see it no

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
bigger so people can actually see it no

it<00:02:38.100> finishes<00:02:38.430> on<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> 14th<00:02:39.210> or<00:02:39.270> 15th<00:02:39.420> so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it finishes on like the 14th or 15th so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.260 
it finishes on like the 14th or 15th so
