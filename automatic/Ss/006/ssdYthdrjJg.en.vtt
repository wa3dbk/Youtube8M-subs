00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.960
 Arnold and welcome back to 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.200
 the last seven holes the whole of Kuju recruits written by Luis 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.029
 Serrano and I have to have one too 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.519
 despite being close to shore 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.039
 Food but we make the heart before her video "Amok PaydayÂ» 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.539
 but then not won by Gina Maas victory so Hohmann Kockisch have 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.329
 who wanted to make a huge battered joy who overdrawn is something 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.329
 very important and dpa 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.739
 this is you know Iskra Bangkok is not a professional 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.579
 Solutions ready to let it just so 1 lit 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.960
 have perfect 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.220
 I simply would 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.620
 Double 1 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.630
 So, for example, I do not know this book here at all Nathan Martz 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.210
 read 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.640
 and I will prepare myself for my last 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.340
 My last he prepared himself to the world I will not 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.870
 to prepare 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 just because I can handle that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 that's not good for the spontaneous that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.020
 then this is also the question they partly understand since Citron 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.750
 and then that was something for me 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 new unfamiliar three lifts with you from Utrecht high 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.550
 s &amp; p 500 systematic said have 15 ff shorter 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.860
 that is a very good thing for me 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.040
 it is serious 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.650
 it is quiet here 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.930
 that's me 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 almost can not concentrate that succeeded 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.170
 I have talked about weapons 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.670
 Herbede 15 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.970
 December completely filled water bottles 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.780
 Rainer Heugabel got the estimate from the loading area Spec Ops and in the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 In mid-March next to Express still through 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.360
 to see if then maybe something else hid 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 if you excel to 80 you have what i have to say 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.990
 it was not complaining about in quotes 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.060
 meant but it was complained 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.000
 or bondage Werner Liersch 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.030
 around 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.900
 that I would not imagine my voice at all I place mine 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.269
 First of all, vote 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.019
 Mr. z and 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.219
 Well and sounds like striker 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.319
 in Oman the inner life that really is the guild 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.099
 and secondly i had to shake my shots so there is no one 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.470
 Intervene effect call itself Plate and made clear that the whole something 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.309
 Platter No, that's not Echo Madryn 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.709
 and if I were the Russians they would all the time have glory like the echo 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.939
 in a room or something like that 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.679
 for you child something and annoying 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.769
 and that he has mixed this effect, however, have drifted 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.979
 unfortunately the voice is really a bit flat below 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.019
 it's just sometimes that they worry that I'm going to change my voice 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:54.599
 Ventyx world back 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.670
 bring them with three wheelbarrows, "she said to give SAP add-ons 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.719
 extremely, Sacred's chin went up to the car 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.739
 When she left, he leaned out of the windows Feint 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.439
 she has been blogging bushels ever since 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.560
 i want that ex-wrestler to take over she seemed to know that 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.389
 she even has the ships that could get him the fastest 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.509
 the under the top four degrees further where he started 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:20.419
 but you get your own experience 6 f major and co men available 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.609
 Maybe it was with her 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.229
 one is always moved twice she loosens the hole under caveman 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.019
 then carefully in a wheelbarrow for the earth as well 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.209
 Six at &amp; t are also talking about Mattner 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.729
 we do not want to miss if one of you finds something he gets 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.359
 You get taps during the rest of the day and take a shower twice as long 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:43.879
 if i came so full there is that please he typed it besides this 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.979
 Territory 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
 we do not want this to be any piles way here 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.059
 that is all there is then create a relaxed place to be with 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.789
 Mister started skirmish water because after a while also surfaced 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.520
 from time to time Masters brought to the waterfront to other groups 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.520
 but otherwise he did not want to be disturbed by his water 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.299
 He gets along with everything but not from the place 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.059
 should create that in group d nobody needs to feel around 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.329
 Stendal obeyed the instructions 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.440
 carefully the earth through the silos is still open I hope that you have one 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.359
 Wheelbarrows though he knew he would not find anything 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.169
 after all, it was easier than digging a hole yourself 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.210
 when the show came full was also way ahead of in the good piece today 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.430
 evaluation 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.499
 the boss could not stand still 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.460
 He constantly looks around the shoulder, looking around 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.680
 and go with theirs 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.120
 in the team with the superstition going through 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.499
 good still so 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.710
 Literally she said it's his life 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.800
 After a while, the boys should swap places so yours 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.240
 Hexagons Mattner pits 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.690
 Pits horny 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.720
 up during the Legion top pilot 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.499
 almost 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.499
 the most honest court over see below 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.430
 while Sion 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.650
 she calls while she rodeo and torpedo the earth shoveling the wheelbarrows 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.669
 after the end of the bridge over balance while still teaching on the shoulder 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.189
 return to the wheelbarrow 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.610
 we have no hurry repeated the boss several times 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.990
 the important thing is that we do not miss anything 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.099
 the young were rough to every hole and 6 feet deep by 6 feet wide 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.579
 but it was still better to ditch 6 feet than five passive 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.279
 Buchholz said that CNOOC would be an iw-chef 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.349
 I have waited so long because I can wait until tomorrow 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.349
 the water for her 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.879
 cheers 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.059
 since a backup by I'm responsible today in these cases 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.479
 take it 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.550
 Fehmel 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.770
 Hugo Scholtes is enough ", said the boss I have been around long enough 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.080
 I can wait there until tomorrow 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.589
 the water chairman back 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:56.409
 I wonder just where does she know all our names is one of the oldest 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.900
 Camp ran back 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.310
 she is watching and hiding microphones all the time now 6 6 11 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.650
 Cameras installed in the tents in the lounge 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.240
 and he calls Toshiba 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.430
 ask in the showers too 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.849
 he wonders if six sacks are not already paranoid 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:16.659
 the cameras are funny, Georg said no bigger than the name of yours 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.559
 small lake 

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:19.189
 Estelle doubts that 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.469
 he could not imagine that one could produce such small cameras 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:23.930
 Lends microphones 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.120
 Now it became clear why x who did not have breakfast over breakfast in the morning 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.889
 Gold wanted to speak such 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.550
 he was afraid that secures us surprised 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.289
 all the free ones assure them that these holes are not just a character 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.930
 They clearly sought something 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.170
 but whatever they sought they searched in the wrong place 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.699
 when the view over the lake had dug in the Wolgaster when he had that 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.349
 Had found gold washing 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:50.759
 he carried the spot deep into his memory 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.759
 that was class 50 the somewhat shorter view bad as the chapter 16 verse 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.899
 on special 

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:00.400
 then chapter 17 that briefly the chapter 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.400
 5 should 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.879
 also chapter 19 countries the chapters run again reasonably 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.789
 the Herbert Feuerstein 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:14.549
 is practical
