00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
spot here we're going down to what I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.810 
spot here we're going down to what I
think<00:01:05.909> might<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.390> did<00:01:07.040> decompose<00:01:08.040> off<00:01:08.580> its

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
think might be did decompose off its

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.030 
think might be did decompose off its
kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> salt

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040

about this good salt I think it's the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
about this good salt I think it's the
minute<00:01:17.789> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.170> go<00:01:19.289> put<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
minute in a way we go put it in this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.270 
minute in a way we go put it in this
period<00:01:20.399> propane<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.950> try<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> demonstrate

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
period propane and try to demonstrate

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.180 
period propane and try to demonstrate
how<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> use<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.899> one<00:01:25.890> seven
