00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello with you android android 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.450
 today wanted to talk about classic 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.580
 rpg called boulder gay infestation 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.790
 This game costs 330 rubles initially 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.859
 she went out on bye in year 98 and many 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 pc-shniki know that there is a game 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.240
 represents the game by its enough 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.390
 long ago a month ago we only 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 today decided to review it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.080
 This game has an original storyline. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.570
 line and some sort of some addition 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 everything is present for about 6 hours 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.370
 passage here in this game eagle 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 where can we see 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.640
 we can explain how I want to manage 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.329
 our characters are all completely 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 explain darghi's ball is like the main 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.969
 the plot of the line was pizza is that what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.879
 let's additionally push balter 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 gate us and how you see in English 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.620
 language so without knowledge of English 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.510
 language and if you are in this game not previously 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.870
 played then you might think that the game 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.219
 enough on the graphic design 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.439
 primitive but it is a classic 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 genre and people who are in this game 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.090
 played with pleasure will play it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.090
 remember to carry black 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 time some demon appeared attacked 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.490
 cool man I myself never in this 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 I haven't played a game yet 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.689
 computer at that time so i 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.939
 generally with and the series is unfamiliar to me this 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.640
 all shots for the first time but it seems to me trolls 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.039
 sprat was made specifically for here 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.619
 this version android 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.430
 Here we fall down and break reduce 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.799
 who is why he crashed let's 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.060
 we go on this day will be you 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 is not class it different 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.490
 the parameters will be but interesting enough 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.789
 the game and by the way the most important moment the game 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.569
 takes up a lot of space takes 2 and 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:57.090
 30 gigabytes so keep in mind that 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.330
 she will be very much all that's finally 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.250
 we almost finished the screensaver and we 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.039
 now go directly to the most 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.229
 the game as you see there are several 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.410
 menus single player multiplayer store 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.600
 running and settings in the settings can be 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.489
 language gameplay graphics even possible and many 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.280
 other let's choose single player 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.160
 click new game we have going on 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.709
 loading here we can choose already 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.450
 selected characters yes here or we can 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.880
 create a single create Witte 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.489
 click and we can choose the floor there 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.079
 race and more 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.070
 But I’ll choose a character already 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.799
 chosen so let's click play 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.220
 so plot any component to us 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.950
 this explains let's skip and let's go 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.410
 next is the game itself 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 here's how it looks in for given can 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.640
 run delete do not know it was available in the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.410
 while I'm forever it seems to me unlikely 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.090
 get out of this schedule but again 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.829
 I say that she will play people too 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.190
 who previously played this game 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.950
 let's quickly take a little let's 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.950
 so we can move around ate something 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.520
 if we have here 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.380
 computer apologize so so this what 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.290
 so I do not know but here's a map where we 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.730
 we are this as I understand our 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.330
 location denied me 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.190
 cities further here we have this 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.430
 information about quests 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.700
 farther here is our character something different 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.010
 a weapon that can put things out so 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.070
 tell our backpack money is a lot here 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.840
 any parameters further you from us our 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.330
 now the main character is also more 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.180
 detail on pit 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.160
 what armor class we have 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.290
 I can even interesting in this game 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.820
 will be held because it is necessary 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.860
 rather all the magicians we can 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.870
 use 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.890
 here but this settings let's return 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:00.000
 the game itself is so well here as I understand it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.970
 Likely we will attack subjects on 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.630
 travels that we have such a esophagus 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.190
 We've got some but as we 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.460
 move as you see as we 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.640
 move 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.640
 because the whole story is not fully visible 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.590
 we can enter into dialogue with various 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.990
 characters let me come here in 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.880
 this house how can we each building 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.169
 go this regiment this boring is some sort of 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.620
 place where he can go and hotels 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.600
 could communicate with various people she 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.919
 only different posts here as well 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.440
 understand dawn role-playing game for now 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.949
 it means that there are various caves which 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.979
 we can get to fight them 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.810
 let's try now what caves am i 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.000
 I hope to get a meter or not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.389
 let's do it about accounting and let's talk 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.639
 dude so what does that tell me here 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.389
 Well, if I do not know will come out of 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.389
 cave houses 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.849
 in participation because the terrain is like that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.430
 we look inside 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:31.420
 add that you can zoom in and out 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.810
 appear u so you can navigate this 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.629
 Terry can drink 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.939
 staff or what can we 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.659
 attack if we can put a block 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:46.860
 much more some kind of man let's 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.599
 try to come down try to get out 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:57.719
 rooms 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:06:02.699
 No, it didn’t work out well . 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:08.180
 but the stairs are shown well unfortunately 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:08.180

 traveling around this city is what we are 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.650
 we can watch 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.540

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.110
