00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
well for both crawfish and rice

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.130 
well for both crawfish and rice
production<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.310> because<00:04:33.090> rice<00:04:33.360> fields<00:04:33.870> must

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
production and because rice fields must

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.320 
production and because rice fields must
first<00:04:34.440> be<00:04:34.590> flooded<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.280> then<00:04:35.640> drained<00:04:36.030> for
