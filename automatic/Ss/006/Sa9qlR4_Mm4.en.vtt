quick<00:00:04.859> compression<00:00:05.490> test<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:06.000> my<00:00:06.770> new<00:00:07.770> engine

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
quick compression test on my new engine

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.440 
quick compression test on my new engine
here<00:00:08.660> it<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:10.349> actually<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.210> diamond<00:00:12.210> series

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
here it is actually a diamond series

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.880 
here it is actually a diamond series
Briggs<00:00:15.450> plus<00:00:16.160> I'm<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.220> plus<00:00:17.609> series<00:00:17.880> Briggs<00:00:18.330> so

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
Briggs plus I'm in plus series Briggs so

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
Briggs plus I'm in plus series Briggs so
when<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> quick<00:00:20.400> compression<00:00:21.150> test<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.600> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
when do a quick compression test on it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.250 
when do a quick compression test on it
I'm<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.680> set<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> camera<00:00:23.189> down<00:00:23.310> right<00:00:23.609> here

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
I'm gonna set the camera down right here

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.570 
I'm gonna set the camera down right here
I'll<00:00:25.260> crank<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> over<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> little<00:00:26.099> bit<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.460> see

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
I'll crank it over a little bit and see

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.710 
I'll crank it over a little bit and see
how<00:00:26.760> high<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.180> get<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:27.480> show<00:00:27.660> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
how high we can get and I'll show you

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:51.799 
how high we can get and I'll show you
the<00:00:27.869> results<00:00:49.670> this<00:00:50.670> cylinder<00:00:51.090> share<00:00:51.480> will

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the results this cylinder share will

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.380 
the results this cylinder share will
call<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.820> face<00:00:54.210> the

engine<00:00:55.219> we<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.870> approximately<00:00:57.890> 95<00:00:58.890> pounds

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
engine we have approximately 95 pounds

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
engine we have approximately 95 pounds
that's<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> same<00:01:00.629> actually<00:01:00.989> had<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's about the same actually had on

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
that's about the same actually had on
the<00:01:01.379> onin<00:01:01.710> when<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> did<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> same<00:01:03.510> test<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the onin when I did the same test on the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.510 
the onin when I did the same test on the
Onan<00:01:04.409> saw<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.900> 90<00:01:07.380> 95<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
Onan saw like it was 90 95 so this is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.340 
Onan saw like it was 90 95 so this is
about<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.750> ninety<00:01:10.740> almost<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> hundred<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
about and ninety almost a hundred so I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
about and ninety almost a hundred so I
had<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> spark<00:01:14.130> plug<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.820> side<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
had the spark plug in on this side I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.140 
had the spark plug in on this side I
don't<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> start<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
don't want to start it up with that

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.950 
don't want to start it up with that
obviously<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.330> obvious<00:01:18.600> reasons<00:01:22.970> this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
obviously for obvious reasons this

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.360 
obviously for obvious reasons this
loosely<00:01:26.960> put<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.290> spark<00:01:27.710> plug<00:01:27.740> back<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:33.370> and

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
loosely put the spark plug back in and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.610 
loosely put the spark plug back in and
spark<00:01:34.910> plugs<00:01:35.150> this<00:01:35.960> one<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.320> doesn't<00:01:36.500> look

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
spark plugs this one here doesn't look

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.890 
spark plugs this one here doesn't look
horrible<00:01:37.430> believe<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.180> were<00:01:38.240> replaced<00:01:38.600> last

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
horrible believe they were replaced last

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.880 
horrible believe they were replaced last
year<00:01:40.420> but<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.570> machine<00:01:41.810> doesn't<00:01:42.230> use<00:01:42.590> much

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
year but this machine doesn't use much

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.690 
year but this machine doesn't use much
last<00:01:43.130> year<00:01:43.310> either<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:50.830> stepping<00:01:51.830> on<00:01:51.920> my<00:01:52.070> choke

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
last year either so stepping on my choke

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:11.199 
last year either so stepping on my choke
cable<00:02:03.460> got<00:02:04.460> my<00:02:04.580> camera<00:02:09.520> yeah<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:10.790> guy<00:02:10.970> looks

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
cable got my camera yeah this guy looks

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.470 
cable got my camera yeah this guy looks
like<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.890> one<00:02:13.130> though<00:02:13.580> what<00:02:14.030> definitely

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
like this one though what definitely

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.570 
like this one though what definitely
it's<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> lot<00:02:14.780> worse<00:02:15.020> than<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.290> other<00:02:15.470> side<00:02:15.680> it

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it's a lot worse than the other side it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.850 
it's a lot worse than the other side it
seems<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.570> probably<00:02:18.050> running<00:02:18.260> rich<00:02:18.590> on

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
seems like it's probably running rich on

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.680 
seems like it's probably running rich on
this<00:02:19.070> side<00:02:19.370> right<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:20.200> really<00:02:21.200> black<00:02:22.600> see<00:02:23.600> if

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
this side right here really black see if

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.350 
this side right here really black see if
we<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.900> more<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:24.350> less<00:02:24.380> compression<00:02:25.130> now

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:44.740 

stupid<00:02:31.360> little<00:02:31.600> doctoring

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.990 

see<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:45.930> happens<00:02:46.380> here

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
see what happens here

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.940 
see what happens here
my<00:02:48.000> tester<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> air<00:02:49.020> filters<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.830> on

my tester up on the air filters to be on

my tester up on the air filters to be on
the<00:02:50.040> table<00:02:50.220> again

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.059 

about<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.780> same<00:03:18.150> 1995<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:20.739> not<00:03:20.860> too

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
about the same 1995 so that's not too

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.509 
about the same 1995 so that's not too
bad

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
bad

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.069 
bad
originally<00:03:22.269> thought<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.599> thing<00:03:22.750> might<00:03:22.930> need

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
originally thought this thing might need

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.250 
originally thought this thing might need
head<00:03:23.319> gaskets<00:03:24.599> down<00:03:25.599> again<00:03:25.870> will<00:03:26.049> under

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
head gaskets down again will under

00:03:26.260 --> 00:04:23.030 
head gaskets down again will under
course<00:03:26.500> start<00:03:26.769> up

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.270 

there<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.700> go<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:25.230> remember<00:04:25.650> correctly<00:04:26.040> these

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
there we go so remember correctly these

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.610 
there we go so remember correctly these
things<00:04:26.580> use<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> single<00:04:27.720> coil<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.930> one<00:04:31.260> side

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
things use a single coil on the one side

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.550 
things use a single coil on the one side
I'm<00:04:32.250> not<00:04:32.460> 100%<00:04:32.940> sure<00:04:33.270> I've<00:04:33.510> seen<00:04:33.540> I've<00:04:34.320> seen<00:04:34.350> a

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
I'm not 100% sure I've seen I've seen a

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.830 
I'm not 100% sure I've seen I've seen a
few<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.860> these<00:04:34.950> with<00:04:35.160> two<00:04:35.280> coils<00:04:35.550> few<00:04:36.420> Z's<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.750> a

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
few of these with two coils few Z's of a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200 
few of these with two coils few Z's of a
single<00:04:37.230> coil<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.490> I'm<00:04:38.580> not<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.790> hundred<00:04:39.060> percent

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
single coil so I'm not a hundred percent

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.690 
single coil so I'm not a hundred percent
sure<00:04:39.600> what<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:40.050> one<00:04:40.230> has<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.860> was<00:04:41.340> thinking

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
sure what this one has I was thinking

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.700 
sure what this one has I was thinking
about<00:04:41.790> removing<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.330> cover<00:04:42.570> since<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.560> have

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
about removing the cover since I have

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.350 
about removing the cover since I have

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
that starter a little bit of a starter

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.430 
that starter a little bit of a starter
issue<00:04:47.600> so<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:48.630> could<00:04:48.780> replace<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.200> starter

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
issue so I could replace the starter

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.840 
issue so I could replace the starter
just<00:04:49.770> replace<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.280> whole<00:04:50.430> bottom<00:04:50.700> house

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
starter if it's the same if it's the

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.100 
starter if it's the same if it's the
same<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.430> what<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.600> other<00:04:54.720> starter<00:04:55.050> I

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
same as what I have the other starter I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.160 
same as what I have the other starter I
have<00:04:55.380> needs<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.950> little<00:04:56.130> gear<00:04:56.460> on<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.700> top<00:04:57.170> so

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
have needs a little gear on the top so

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.590 
have needs a little gear on the top so
and<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.010> one<00:04:59.190> here<00:04:59.400> is<00:04:59.430> completely

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
and this one here is completely

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.780 
and this one here is completely
it<00:05:01.410> needs<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.680> gear<00:05:01.980> and<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.190> think<00:05:02.400> it<00:05:02.490> needs<00:05:02.640> a
