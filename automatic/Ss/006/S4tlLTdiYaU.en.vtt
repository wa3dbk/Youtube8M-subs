I<00:00:28.039> made<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:28.519> 30<00:00:28.820> stitches<00:00:29.119> wide<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.869> use<00:00:30.710> ma

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
I made it's 30 stitches wide I use ma

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.510 
I made it's 30 stitches wide I use ma
stitch<00:00:31.429> which<00:00:32.240> is<00:00:32.480> knit<00:00:32.900> 1<00:00:33.110> purl<00:00:33.140> 1<00:00:33.530> for<00:00:33.980> 2<00:00:34.250> rows

stitch which is knit 1 purl 1 for 2 rows

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.479 
stitch which is knit 1 purl 1 for 2 rows
and<00:00:34.910> then<00:00:35.180> switch<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.840> purl<00:00:36.140> 1<00:00:36.380> knit<00:00:36.410> 1<00:00:36.680> for<00:00:37.280> 2

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
and then switch to purl 1 knit 1 for 2

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.090 
and then switch to purl 1 knit 1 for 2
rows<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:38.090> repeat<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.200> for<00:00:39.740> the<00:00:39.770> length

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
rows and you repeat that for the length

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.440 
rows and you repeat that for the length
of<00:00:40.750> your<00:00:41.750> purse<00:00:44.380> so<00:00:45.380> now<00:00:45.500> once<00:00:45.740> you've<00:00:45.950> got<00:00:46.450> the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.990 
of your purse so now once you've got the
length<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.050> feel<00:00:48.350> for<00:00:48.620> your<00:00:48.770> purse<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.850> mine

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
length you feel for your purse so mine

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.320 
length you feel for your purse so mine
is<00:00:53.030> about<00:00:53.420> 9<00:00:53.840> inches<00:00:53.870> long<00:00:54.560> and<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:57.170> determine

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
is about 9 inches long and to determine

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.700 
is about 9 inches long and to determine
what<00:00:59.330> your<00:00:59.540> clutch<00:00:59.870> will<00:01:00.140> end<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:00.380> looking

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
what your clutch will end up looking

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.859 
what your clutch will end up looking
like<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:01.850> fold<00:01:02.150> your<00:01:03.670> piece<00:01:04.670> of<00:01:05.000> knitted

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
like you fold your piece of knitted

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.399 
like you fold your piece of knitted
fabric<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.530> half<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.540> then<00:01:08.540> fold<00:01:08.570> over<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
fabric in half and then fold over the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.060 
fabric in half and then fold over the
top<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:11.329> is<00:01:11.390> roughly<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.170> size<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.859> it

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
top and that is roughly the size that it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.789 
top and that is roughly the size that it
will<00:01:13.310> end<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:13.789> so<00:01:14.659> once<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.049> get<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:15.560> point

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
will end up so once you get to the point

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.940 
will end up so once you get to the point
where<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.189> think<00:01:16.219> is<00:01:17.229> how<00:01:18.229> big<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:18.590> want<00:01:18.770> it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
where you think is how big you want it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.380 
where you think is how big you want it
we're<00:01:19.549> going<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.759> start<00:01:19.969> putting<00:01:20.149> our

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
we're going to start putting our

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.300 
we're going to start putting our
buttonholes<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.100> buttons<00:01:22.429> I'm<00:01:22.729> using

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
buttonholes and the buttons I'm using

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.099 
buttonholes and the buttons I'm using
are<00:01:25.310> these<00:01:25.549> gold<00:01:25.939> ones<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.569> the<00:01:29.689> size<00:01:29.929> of

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
are these gold ones so with the size of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.999 
are these gold ones so with the size of
these<00:01:31.060> they<00:01:32.060> will<00:01:32.240> fit<00:01:32.600> just<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:33.380> yarn-over

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
these they will fit just a yarn-over

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.849 
these they will fit just a yarn-over
buttonhole<00:01:34.670> if<00:01:34.999> you're<00:01:35.840> using<00:01:36.049> bigger

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
you're using anything bigger than that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.840 
you're using anything bigger than that
you<00:01:44.719> could<00:01:44.869> try<00:01:45.109> a<00:01:45.139> double<00:01:45.409> yarn<00:01:45.799> over<00:01:46.159> which

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
you could try a double yarn over which

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.699 
you could try a double yarn over which
is<00:01:47.030> we<00:01:47.240> wrap<00:01:47.479> it<00:01:47.509> yarn<00:01:48.079> over<00:01:48.350> twice<00:01:48.380> or<00:01:49.069> you<00:01:49.100> can

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709 
is we wrap it yarn over twice or you can

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.499 
is we wrap it yarn over twice or you can
bind<00:01:51.709> off<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.009> couple<00:01:52.490> stitches<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:53.240> cast

bind off a couple stitches and then cast

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.569 
bind off a couple stitches and then cast
them<00:01:53.689> back<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.049> on<00:01:54.289> your<00:01:54.649> returning<00:01:55.609> row<00:01:57.579> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
going to yarn over and then knit two

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.980 
going to yarn over and then knit two
together<00:02:09.970> then<00:02:10.970> I'm<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.330> go<00:02:11.510> four

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
together then I'm going to go four

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.250 
together then I'm going to go four
stitches<00:02:12.230> from<00:02:12.830> there<00:02:13.629> yarn<00:02:14.629> over<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.019> knit

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
stitches from there yarn over and knit

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.740 
stitches from there yarn over and knit
two<00:02:15.530> together<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.220> then

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
two together and then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.700 
two together and then
between<00:02:17.110> will<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:17.410> six<00:02:17.980> stitches<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.560> you're

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
between will be six stitches so you're

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.790 
between will be six stitches so you're
going<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.890> keep<00:02:21.160> up<00:02:21.430> with<00:02:22.390> your<00:02:23.020> ma<00:02:23.380> stitch

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
going to keep up with your ma stitch

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:39.900 
going to keep up with your ma stitch
pattern<00:02:25.710> while<00:02:26.710> making<00:02:27.010> your<00:02:27.280> buttonholes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.059 

so<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:40.780> because

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.300 

I<00:02:44.129> have<00:02:44.939> to<00:02:45.180> knit<00:02:45.390> two<00:02:45.599> together<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:46.950> next

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
I have to knit two together my next

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.819 
I have to knit two together my next
stitch<00:02:47.489> would<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.999> a<00:02:48.030> purl<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:49.680> was

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
stitch would be a purl if I was

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.459 
stitch would be a purl if I was
continuing<00:02:50.489> my<00:02:50.700> stitch<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> stitch<00:02:52.170> from

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:52.469 
continuing my stitch but the stitch from

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.259 
continuing my stitch but the stitch from
