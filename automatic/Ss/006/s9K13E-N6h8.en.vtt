00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
key onto the keyboard so let's start out

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.290 
key onto the keyboard so let's start out
by<00:01:02.710> looking<00:01:02.890> at<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.490> metal<00:01:03.730> plates<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.090> are

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
by looking at the metal plates that are

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.140 
by looking at the metal plates that are
on<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.690> keyboard<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.470> can<00:01:06.160> see<00:01:06.490> there's<00:01:06.760> two

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
on the keyboard you can see there's two

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.370 
on the keyboard you can see there's two
hooks<00:01:07.570> at<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.840> top<00:01:08.020> here<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:10.600> hooks<00:01:10.960> at

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
hooks at the top here and two hooks at

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.770 
hooks at the top here and two hooks at
the<00:01:11.440> bottom<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:12.220> are<00:01:12.480> further<00:01:13.480> away<00:01:13.630> from

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
the bottom that are further away from

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.760 
the bottom that are further away from
each<00:01:14.110> other<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:17.200> sure<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.470> look<00:01:17.590> at<00:01:17.710> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
each other and make sure to look at the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.280 
each other and make sure to look at the
different<00:01:18.190> keys<00:01:18.430> because<00:01:18.730> those<00:01:19.660> metal

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
different keys because those metal

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.100 
different keys because those metal
plates<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.830> change<00:01:21.130> positions<00:01:22.110> sometimes

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
plates can change positions sometimes

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.670 
plates can change positions sometimes
the<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:25.120> ones<00:01:25.330> close<00:01:25.720> together<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.410> be<00:01:26.560> at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
the the ones close together can be at

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.090 
the the ones close together can be at
the<00:01:26.800> bottom<00:01:26.980> or<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.300> left<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.720> right<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
the bottom or to the left and right so

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400 
the bottom or to the left and right so
that's<00:01:30.490> going<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> determine<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.510> position

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
that's going to determine the position

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.770 
that's going to determine the position
of<00:01:32.470> these<00:01:32.680> pieces<00:01:33.040> here<00:01:36.119> let's<00:01:37.119> start<00:01:37.210> out<00:01:37.479> by

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
of these pieces here let's start out by

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.160 
of these pieces here let's start out by
clicking<00:01:38.560> these<00:01:38.950> two<00:01:39.250> pieces<00:01:39.700> together<00:01:40.170> what

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
clicking these two pieces together what

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.580 
clicking these two pieces together what
you<00:01:41.320> want<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.619> do<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:42.900> determine<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.080> position

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
you want to do is determine the position

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.440 
you want to do is determine the position
for<00:01:44.950> both<00:01:45.130> pieces<00:01:45.490> first<00:01:45.880> let's<00:01:46.210> start<00:01:46.270> with

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
for both pieces first let's start with

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.290 
for both pieces first let's start with
the<00:01:46.690> larger<00:01:47.110> piece<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:48.220> can<00:01:48.430> see<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.759> has<00:01:48.970> two

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
the larger piece you can see it has two

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.150 
the larger piece you can see it has two
holes<00:01:49.479> at<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.900> bottom<00:01:50.190> that's<00:01:51.190> important

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
holes at the bottom that's important

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.210 
holes at the bottom that's important
because<00:01:54.900> those<00:01:55.900> two<00:01:56.229> holes<00:01:56.560> are<00:01:56.800> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.009> go

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
because those two holes are going to go

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.670 
because those two holes are going to go
as<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.850> two<00:01:58.090> holes<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.630> are<00:01:58.780> separated<00:01:59.470> from

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
as the two holes that are separated from

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.719 
as the two holes that are separated from
each<00:01:59.800> other<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.190> case<00:02:03.429> they're<00:02:03.640> at

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
each other more in this case they're at

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.490 
each other more in this case they're at
the<00:02:03.850> bottom<00:02:04.030> but<00:02:04.539> like<00:02:04.690> I<00:02:04.810> said<00:02:04.869> make<00:02:05.320> sure<00:02:05.350> to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
the bottom but like I said make sure to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.870 
the bottom but like I said make sure to
look<00:02:05.710> at<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.890> different<00:02:06.340> keys<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:08.850> make<00:02:09.850> sure

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
look at the different keys so make sure

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.720 
look at the different keys so make sure
to<00:02:10.030> not<00:02:10.960> put<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.440> piece<00:02:11.680> upside<00:02:12.220> down<00:02:12.460> like

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
to not put this piece upside down like

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.130 
to not put this piece upside down like
that<00:02:12.970> by<00:02:13.720> feeling<00:02:14.380> underneath<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:16.140> vertical

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that by feeling underneath the vertical

now<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.460> position<00:02:27.670> for<00:02:28.060> that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
now that you know the position for that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.730 
now that you know the position for that
piece<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.630> get<00:02:28.780> your<00:02:28.930> next<00:02:29.140> piece<00:02:29.470> which<00:02:29.710> is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
piece you get your next piece which is

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.320 
piece you get your next piece which is
this<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:31.020> has<00:02:34.260> two<00:02:35.260> holes<00:02:35.740> in<00:02:36.100> two<00:02:36.700> sticks<00:02:37.030> in

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
this it has two holes in two sticks in

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.090 
this it has two holes in two sticks in
the<00:02:37.569> middle<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.550> two<00:02:40.319> sticks<00:02:41.319> at<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.680> bottom

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the middle and two sticks at the bottom

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.140 
the middle and two sticks at the bottom
but<00:02:43.500> look<00:02:44.500> carefully<00:02:44.830> because<00:02:45.340> that<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.000> has

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
but look carefully because that it has

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.170 
but look carefully because that it has
also<00:02:46.720> has<00:02:46.930> two<00:02:47.230> sticks<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.950> top<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.970> those

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
also has two sticks at the top but those

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.370 
also has two sticks at the top but those
are<00:02:49.360> shorter<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:51.630> make<00:02:52.630> sure<00:02:52.660> not<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.959> put<00:02:53.200> this

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
are shorter so make sure not to put this

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.840 
are shorter so make sure not to put this
piece<00:02:53.709> upside<00:02:54.280> down<00:02:54.520> like<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.110> by<00:02:56.850> things

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
piece upside down like that by things

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.320 
piece upside down like that by things
Inc<00:02:58.300> you<00:02:58.870> know<00:02:59.020> if<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.380> feel<00:02:59.730> two<00:03:00.730> bumps<00:03:01.120> here

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
Inc you know if you feel two bumps here

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.880 
Inc you know if you feel two bumps here
at<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.569> bottom

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
at the bottom

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.590 
at the bottom
that's<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.770> keyboard<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:07.000> top<00:03:07.420> it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
that's that this is a keyboard on top it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's that this is a keyboard on top it
has<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.960> be<00:03:08.110> smooth<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.670> now<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.030> know

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
has to be smooth so now that you know

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.500 
has to be smooth so now that you know
the<00:03:10.270> position<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.870> these<00:03:11.050> pieces<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:14.010> put

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
the position for these pieces you put

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.070 
the position for these pieces you put
the<00:03:16.510> small<00:03:17.200> piece<00:03:17.500> over<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:19.180> large<00:03:19.420> piece<00:03:19.810> and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
the small piece over the large piece and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.490 
the small piece over the large piece and
then<00:03:20.740> you<00:03:20.860> just<00:03:21.070> put<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.630> top<00:03:22.630> bar<00:03:23.080> of<00:03:23.110> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
then you just put the top bar of the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.520 
then you just put the top bar of the
small<00:03:23.800> piece<00:03:24.210> underneath<00:03:25.210> the<00:03:25.750> top<00:03:26.080> bar<00:03:26.500> of

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
small piece underneath the top bar of

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.410 
small piece underneath the top bar of
the<00:03:27.070> larger<00:03:27.490> piece<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:31.030> hold<00:03:31.240> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
the larger piece like that you hold it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.660 
the larger piece like that you hold it
in<00:03:31.510> place<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.510> want<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.930> is

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
in place and then what you want to do is

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.790 
in place and then what you want to do is
make<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.910> thick<00:03:37.240> in<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.930> small<00:03:38.230> piece<00:03:38.470> go

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
make this thick in the small piece go

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.790 
make this thick in the small piece go
into<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.220> holes<00:03:39.520> and<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.840> larger<00:03:41.200> pieces<00:03:41.440> so

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
into the holes and the larger pieces so

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.060 
into the holes and the larger pieces so
you<00:03:41.830> just<00:03:42.220> separate<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.850> two<00:03:46.390> pieces<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.110> that

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
you just separate the two pieces so that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.220 
you just separate the two pieces so that
it<00:03:48.280> has<00:03:48.460> enough<00:03:48.490> space<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:50.110> go<00:03:50.290> into<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.310> hole

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
it has enough space to go into the hole

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.590 
it has enough space to go into the hole
you<00:03:53.230> get<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.680> large<00:03:53.920> piece<00:03:54.420> separate<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.570> from

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
you get the large piece separate it from

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.720 
you get the large piece separate it from
the<00:03:55.840> lot<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.410> smaller<00:03:56.860> piece<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:59.580> there<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
the lot of smaller piece and there you

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.110 
the lot of smaller piece and there you
go

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
go

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.280 
go
now<00:04:01.450> both<00:04:02.020> pieces<00:04:02.380> are<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.860> one<00:04:03.040> piece<00:04:04.290> what

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
now both pieces are just one piece what

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.410 
now both pieces are just one piece what
you<00:04:05.410> do<00:04:05.560> next<00:04:05.740> is<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.160> put<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.760> two<00:04:06.970> bottom

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
you do next is you put the two bottom

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.800 
you do next is you put the two bottom
holes<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.290> corner<00:04:09.060> into<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.270> hooks<00:04:10.510> like

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
holes in the corner into the hooks like

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.310 
holes in the corner into the hooks like
we<00:04:10.990> said<00:04:11.170> earlier<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:13.180> hooks<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.200> are

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
we said earlier the hooks that are

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.880 
we said earlier the hooks that are
separated<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.670> put<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.150> all<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.480> way<00:04:16.540> in<00:04:16.890> then

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
separated you put it all the way in then

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.270 
separated you put it all the way in then
you<00:04:18.010> get<00:04:18.220> something<00:04:18.460> since<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.330> use<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> blade<00:04:20.280> I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
you get something since I use a blade I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.020 
you get something since I use a blade I
hold<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.060> bottom<00:04:22.450> part<00:04:22.750> down<00:04:23.790> and<00:04:24.790> what<00:04:24.940> you

between<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.820> rubber<00:04:30.970> Cup<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:32.350> plastic

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
between the rubber Cup and the plastic

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.090 
between the rubber Cup and the plastic
pieces<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:34.030> push<00:04:34.300> upward<00:04:34.900> not<00:04:35.560> against

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
pieces and you push upward not against

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.550 
pieces and you push upward not against
the<00:04:36.370> keyboard<00:04:36.640> downward<00:04:37.540> but<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.440> we're

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
the keyboard downward but what we're

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.050 
the keyboard downward but what we're
trying<00:04:38.680> to<00:04:38.770> do<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:39.040> stretch<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.580> plastic

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
trying to do is stretch the plastic

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.660 
trying to do is stretch the plastic
pieces<00:04:40.330> so<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.200> next<00:04:41.440> hooks<00:04:41.830> that<00:04:42.610> are

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
pieces so that the next hooks that are

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.080 
pieces so that the next hooks that are
on<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.970> top<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.510> grab<00:04:43.780> onto<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.290> plastic<00:04:45.090> so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
on the top can grab onto the plastic so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.560 
on the top can grab onto the plastic so
let's<00:04:46.720> go<00:04:46.870> ahead<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.080> do<00:04:47.290> that<00:04:48.060> push<00:04:49.060> upward

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
let's go ahead and do that push upward

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.740 
let's go ahead and do that push upward
and<00:04:50.400> until<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.520> feel<00:04:51.730> that<00:04:51.760> it<00:04:52.030> clicks<00:04:52.330> make

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
and until you feel that it clicks make

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.740 
and until you feel that it clicks make
sure<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.080> clicks<00:04:53.790> observe<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:55.000> closely<00:04:55.240> and

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
sure it clicks observe it closely and

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.400 
sure it clicks observe it closely and
everything<00:04:56.910> then<00:04:57.910> you<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.240> get<00:04:58.390> your<00:04:58.540> teeth

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
everything then you just get your teeth

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.560 
everything then you just get your teeth
you<00:05:00.650> put<00:05:00.920> it<00:05:01.040> right<00:05:01.250> into<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.730> center<00:05:02.000> and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570
