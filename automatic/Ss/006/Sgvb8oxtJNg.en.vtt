very interesting at least I thought they

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.700 
very interesting at least I thought they
were<00:00:09.570> pretty<00:00:09.719> cool<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> first<00:00:10.260> learned

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
were pretty cool when I first learned

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
were pretty cool when I first learned
about<00:00:10.800> them<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.910> first<00:00:12.150> thing<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
about them and the first thing is is

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600 
about them and the first thing is is
that<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> looks<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.469> dice<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.980> changing<00:00:14.490> of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
that it looks like dice is changing of

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.640 
that it looks like dice is changing of
the<00:00:14.639> way<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.839> set<00:00:16.139> up<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:16.350> server

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
the way that you can set up your server

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.769 
the way that you can set up your server
but<00:00:16.920> also<00:00:17.130> search<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:17.880> servers<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
but also search for servers in the

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.390 
but also search for servers in the
upcoming<00:00:18.900> game<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.770> sounds<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.220> there's

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
upcoming game it sounds like there's

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.380 
upcoming game it sounds like there's
going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.699> three<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.270> types

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
going to be three different types

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
going to be three different types
there's<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.080> official<00:00:22.830> ranked

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
there's going to be official ranked

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.970 
there's going to be official ranked
normal<00:00:23.910> ranked<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.779> unranked<00:00:25.500> servers

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
normal ranked and then unranked servers

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.009 
normal ranked and then unranked servers
the<00:00:26.400> official<00:00:26.910> ranked<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.539> your

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the official ranked will be your

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.330 
the official ranked will be your
standard<00:00:28.349> battlefield<00:00:29.160> experience

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
standard battlefield experience

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550 
standard battlefield experience
basically<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> game<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.779> dice<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.260> trying

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
basically the game that dice is trying

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.810 
basically the game that dice is trying
to<00:00:31.740> create<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> balancing<00:00:32.700> everything

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to create and balancing everything

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
to create and balancing everything
around<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.480> we'll<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> standard<00:00:34.380> server

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
around so we'll have the standard server

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
around so we'll have the standard server
take<00:00:35.280> account<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> normal

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
take account it will have the normal

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.990 
take account it will have the normal
vehicle<00:00:37.170> spawn<00:00:37.469> rates<00:00:37.850> basically<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
vehicle spawn rates basically the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
vehicle spawn rates basically the
experience<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.570> diced<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.200> trying<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
experience that diced is trying to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.610 
experience that diced is trying to
create<00:00:41.100> four<00:00:41.430> people<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.020> normal

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
create four people then for the normal

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
create four people then for the normal
ranked<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.730> allow<00:00:45.000> players<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.809> people

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
ranked that will allow players or people

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.720 
ranked that will allow players or people
that<00:00:46.350> set<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> servers<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that set up the servers to kind of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
that set up the servers to kind of
change<00:00:47.940> things<00:00:48.329> slightly<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
change things slightly so if you want to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.080 
change things slightly so if you want to
have<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.550> higher<00:00:50.760> certificate

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
have a little bit higher certificate

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
have a little bit higher certificate
ticket<00:00:51.930> count<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:52.770> maybe

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
ticket count so you want to go for maybe

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.910 
ticket count so you want to go for maybe
300<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> 500<00:00:53.969> maybe<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.170> want<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> so

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
300 to 500 maybe you want to make it so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
300 to 500 maybe you want to make it so
that<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.730> turn<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.379> killcam<00:00:58.379> things

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that you turn off the killcam things

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.349 
that you turn off the killcam things
aren't<00:00:59.309> concrete<00:00:59.670> at<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.850> point<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.210> they're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
aren't concrete at this point so they're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.700 
aren't concrete at this point so they're
still<00:01:00.539> trying<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> set<00:01:00.960> things<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.350> but

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
still trying to set things up but

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
still trying to set things up but
basically<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.399> small<00:01:02.879> tweaks<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
basically very small tweaks to the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.780 
basically very small tweaks to the
server<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.379> won't<00:01:04.650> ruin<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> experience<00:01:05.580> or

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
server that won't ruin the experience or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
server that won't ruin the experience or
dramatically<00:01:06.299> change<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> experience<00:01:07.350> from

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
dramatically change the experience from

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.850 
dramatically change the experience from
the<00:01:08.549> official<00:01:09.000> rank<00:01:09.420> servers<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:10.619> allow

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the official rank servers but will allow

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
the official rank servers but will allow
you<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.189> change<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> slightly<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you to change it slightly so that you

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
you to change it slightly so that you
can<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> tailor<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.380> play<00:01:13.979> style

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
can kind of tailor it to your play style

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
can kind of tailor it to your play style
but<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> same<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.299> allowing<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
but at the same time allowing you to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
but at the same time allowing you to
progress<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> normal<00:01:17.280> rank<00:01:17.520> server<00:01:17.759> would

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
progress as a normal rank server would

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.160 
progress as a normal rank server would
so<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.330> still<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.840> weapons

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so you can still get all the weapons

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
so you can still get all the weapons
that<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.470> unlock<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> get<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> bunch

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that you would unlock if you get a bunch

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
that you would unlock if you get a bunch
of<00:01:20.580> new<00:01:20.670> dog<00:01:20.880> tags<00:01:21.240> you're<00:01:21.659> still<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
of new dog tags you're still going to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
of new dog tags you're still going to
keep<00:01:22.290> those<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
keep those but then you have the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
keep those but then you have the
unranked<00:01:24.840> servers<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.650> basically

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
unranked servers and this basically

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
unranked servers and this basically
allows<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.970> whatever<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.930> if

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
allows you to do whatever you want if

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
allows you to do whatever you want if
you<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.590> two<00:01:29.189> thousand<00:01:29.729> tickets

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
of months after the launch date you'll

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.410 
of months after the launch date you'll
know<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.140> it's<00:04:07.410> almost<00:04:07.800> impossible<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.940> do

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
know that it's almost impossible to do

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.000 
know that it's almost impossible to do
well<00:04:09.630> with<00:04:09.720> him<00:04:09.840> because<00:04:09.990> all<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.440> had<00:04:10.710> was

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
well with him because all you had was

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.790 
well with him because all you had was
the<00:04:11.880> main<00:04:12.120> minigun<00:04:12.840> canon<00:04:13.260> like<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.380> cannon

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
the main minigun canon like the cannon

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.320 
the main minigun canon like the cannon
in<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:13.950> front<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.490> was<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.940> didn't<00:04:15.180> get

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
in the front that was it you didn't get

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.539 
in the front that was it you didn't get
flares<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:16.109> didn't<00:04:16.350> get<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.530> pods<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
flares you didn't get the pods the

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.420 
flares you didn't get the pods the
rocket<00:04:18.090> pods<00:04:18.270> nothing<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.230> just<00:04:19.530> had<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
rocket pods nothing you just had the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.010 
rocket pods nothing you just had the
cannon<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.970> front<00:04:21.210> and<00:04:21.390> so<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.780> was<00:04:21.840> almost

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
cannon in the front and so it was almost

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.440 
cannon in the front and so it was almost
impossible<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:23.250> be<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.520> on<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.729> sky<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.240> do

impossible to be up on the sky and do
