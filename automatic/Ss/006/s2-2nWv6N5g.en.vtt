00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
now are there pretty much used for the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
now are there pretty much used for the
crafting<00:01:10.230> recipes<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.980> probably<00:01:11.190> would

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
crafting recipes as you probably would

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520 
crafting recipes as you probably would
have<00:01:11.460> guessed<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:12.510> spawn<00:01:12.810> naturally<00:01:13.050> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
have guessed they spawn naturally in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.650 
have guessed they spawn naturally in
your<00:01:13.860> world<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.460> not<00:01:15.000> too<00:01:15.270> sure<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.480> you'd

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
your world I'm not too sure if you'd

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.970 
your world I'm not too sure if you'd
have<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.840> generate<00:01:16.050> a<00:01:16.230> new<00:01:16.410> world<00:01:16.620> for<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
have to generate a new world for them to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.250 
have to generate a new world for them to
form<00:01:17.190> or<00:01:17.550> maybe<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> load<00:01:19.050> some

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
form or maybe just you need to load some

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.710 
form or maybe just you need to load some
new<00:01:19.380> chunks<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.890> anyway<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.540> use

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
new chunks but anyway are you can use

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
new chunks but anyway are you can use
these<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.530> gunpowder<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> get

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
these to get gunpowder so if you get

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.180 
these to get gunpowder so if you get
sulfur<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.270> saltpeter<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.680> believe<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.160> have

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
sulfur and saltpeter I believe you have

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.190 
sulfur and saltpeter I believe you have
to<00:01:26.460> smell<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> sulfur<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:28.050> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
to smell the sulfur but not the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.470 
to smell the sulfur but not the
saltpeter<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.760> put<00:01:29.910> them<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.180> crafting

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
saltpeter you can put them in a crafting

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.030 
saltpeter you can put them in a crafting
table<00:01:30.510> and<00:01:30.930> you'll<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.230> gunpowder<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:31.980> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
table and you'll get gunpowder so it's a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.560 
table and you'll get gunpowder so it's a
really<00:01:32.190> easy<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> getting<00:01:32.940> gunpowder<00:01:33.330> if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really easy way of getting gunpowder if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
really easy way of getting gunpowder if
you<00:01:33.690> don't<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.080> killing<00:01:34.320> creepers<00:01:34.800> or<00:01:35.190> maybe

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you don't like killing creepers or maybe

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.950 
you don't like killing creepers or maybe
you're<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.730> bad<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.060> killing<00:01:36.420> creepers<00:01:36.750> or

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
you're just bad at killing creepers or

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
you're just bad at killing creepers or
maybe<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.290> need<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> man<00:01:37.830> up<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.060> we

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
maybe just need to man up but there we

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
maybe just need to man up but there we
go<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.320> also<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.280> called

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.420 
quite shrapnel from basically shoving
lead<00:01:45.120> into<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.810> inventory<00:01:46.260> or<00:01:46.650> crafting

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
lead into your inventory or crafting

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.610 
lead into your inventory or crafting
table<00:01:47.729> either<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.409> give<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
table either one and that will give you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.440 
table either one and that will give you
quite<00:01:49.860> shrapnel<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.270> make

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
quite shrapnel and that's how you make

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
quite shrapnel and that's how you make
the<00:01:51.630> grenades<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.040> get<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.580> lead<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> put

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the grenades if you get to lead and put

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
the grenades if you get to lead and put
a<00:01:54.780> quite<00:01:55.200> shrapnel<00:01:55.800> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> middle<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.940> will

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
a quite shrapnel in the middle you will

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.899 
a quite shrapnel in the middle you will
get<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.420> medium<00:01:58.350> shrapnel<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.610> kind<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
get a medium shrapnel so that kind of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
get a medium shrapnel so that kind of
makes<00:01:59.970> no<00:02:00.270> sense<00:02:00.510> but<00:02:00.659> hopefully<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
makes no sense but hopefully it will in

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.810 
makes no sense but hopefully it will in
a<00:02:01.740> second<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.640> I'm<00:02:02.760> just<00:02:02.940> set<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.090> today<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
a second so I'm just set it today and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.850 
a second so I'm just set it today and
voila<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.120> move<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.990> chest<00:02:07.290> there's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
voila and move on to this chest there's

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.320 
voila and move on to this chest there's
another<00:02:08.129> type<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.399> shrapnel<00:02:08.670> which<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.090> high

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
another type of shrapnel which is high

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.180 
another type of shrapnel which is high
shrapnel<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.349> basically<00:02:10.560> lead

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
shrapnel and that's basically lead

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.910 
shrapnel and that's basically lead
ingots<00:02:11.790> there<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.780> medium<00:02:13.200> shrapnel<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.740> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ingots there with medium shrapnel in the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.710 
ingots there with medium shrapnel in the
middle<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.480> light

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
middle so as you can see to get light

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.570 
middle so as you can see to get light
shrapnel<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.650> lead<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.340> get

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
shrapnel just one lead to get

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.730 
shrapnel just one lead to get
medium<00:02:18.090> shrapnel<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.750> need<00:02:18.960> lead<00:02:19.350> with<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
medium shrapnel you need lead with the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.490 
medium shrapnel you need lead with the
previous<00:02:20.580> shrapnel<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.330> middle<00:02:21.570> so<00:02:21.780> quite

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
previous shrapnel in the middle so quite

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.700 
previous shrapnel in the middle so quite
to<00:02:23.280> get<00:02:23.460> medium<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.450> medium<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.500> get

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
to get medium and then medium to get

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.880 
to get medium and then medium to get
high<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:26.970> kind<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> makes<00:02:27.960> sense<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.440> probably

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
high so kind of makes sense I probably

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.070 
high so kind of makes sense I probably
explained<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.790> explain<00:02:30.570> did<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
explained it it really explain did it I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.990 
explained it it really explain did it I
explained<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:31.890> really<00:02:32.190> badly<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.880> we

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
explained that really badly but there we

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.590 
explained that really badly but there we
go<00:02:33.180> now<00:02:33.750> these<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.410> recipes<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:35.250> our

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
go now these are the recipes for our

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.110 
go now these are the recipes for our
grenades<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.740> SDI<00:02:38.130> basically<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> world

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
grenades so the SDI basically the world

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.380 
grenades so the SDI basically the world
war<00:02:39.300> one<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:41.280> need<00:02:41.430> three<00:02:41.850> quite

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
war one one you need three quite

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720 
war one one you need three quite
shrapnel<00:02:42.810> three<00:02:43.470> gun<00:02:43.650> powder<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.160> stick<00:02:44.490> so

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
shrapnel three gun powder and a stick so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.730 
shrapnel three gun powder and a stick so
obviously<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> stick<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> handle<00:02:45.900> then

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
obviously the stick is the handle then

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.490 
obviously the stick is the handle then
we've<00:02:46.890> got<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.340> our<00:02:47.600> mk2<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.870> need<00:02:49.050> for

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
we've got for our mk2 you need for

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.550 
we've got for our mk2 you need for
medium<00:02:50.190> shrapnel<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.360> for<00:02:51.900> gunpowder<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
medium shrapnel and for gunpowder and a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.490 
medium shrapnel and for gunpowder and a
piece<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.740> redstone<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> m67<00:02:55.140> you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
piece of redstone and for the m67 you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.120 
piece of redstone and for the m67 you
need<00:02:55.680> for<00:02:56.040> high<00:02:56.280> shrapnel<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:57.800> gunpowder<00:02:58.800> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
need for high shrapnel for gunpowder and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.310 
need for high shrapnel for gunpowder and
red<00:02:59.430> stone<00:02:59.640> in<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> middle<00:02:59.880> okay<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:00.780> let's<00:03:01.200> go

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
red stone in the middle okay so let's go

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.500 
red stone in the middle okay so let's go
ahead<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.650> test<00:03:02.130> out<00:03:02.400> our<00:03:02.670> grenades<00:03:03.060> probably

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
ahead and test out our grenades probably

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.880 
ahead and test out our grenades probably
best<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.870> fly<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.620> bit<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
best just to fly up a little bit so you

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.220 
best just to fly up a little bit so you
can<00:03:04.980> see<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.340> damage<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:07.050> is

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
can see the damage that we do so this is

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.020 
can see the damage that we do so this is
our<00:03:07.380> world<00:03:07.620> war<00:03:07.890> one<00:03:08.190> grenade<00:03:08.760> which

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
our world war one grenade which

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.870 
our world war one grenade which
obviously<00:03:09.570> is<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.350> least<00:03:10.590> strong<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.730> can

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
obviously is the least strong as you can

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.760 
obviously is the least strong as you can
see<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.390> doesn't<00:03:12.660> really<00:03:12.990> make<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.500> much<00:03:13.560> of

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
see it doesn't really make that much of

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.160 
see it doesn't really make that much of
a<00:03:14.250> hole<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.090> ground<00:03:15.240> took<00:03:15.570> out<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.810> cactus

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
a hole in the ground took out the cactus

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.440 
a hole in the ground took out the cactus
I'll<00:03:16.709> put<00:03:17.070> like<00:03:17.220> one<00:03:17.580> deep<00:03:17.880> hole<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I'll put like one deep hole in the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.600 
I'll put like one deep hole in the
ground<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.230> doesn't<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.680> that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
ground but really it doesn't do that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.520 
ground but really it doesn't do that
much<00:03:20.670> damage<00:03:20.880> especially<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.110> find<00:03:22.320> some

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
much damage especially if you find some

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.199 
much damage especially if you find some
stones<00:03:22.800> if<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.070> go<00:03:23.220> ahead<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.550> dig<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.180> way

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
stones if I go ahead and dig all the way

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.390 
stones if I go ahead and dig all the way
down<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.450> stone<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:25.440> actually<00:03:25.560> finds<00:03:26.310> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
down to stone it's actually finds it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.979 
down to stone it's actually finds it
quite<00:03:26.550> hard<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:27.120> get<00:03:27.330> through<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> stone<00:03:27.870> as

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
quite hard to get through the stone as

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.630 
quite hard to get through the stone as
you<00:03:28.110> can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.190> go<00:03:29.310> ahead<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.489> throw

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
you can see so I just go ahead and throw

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.050 
you can see so I just go ahead and throw
one<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.120> really<00:03:31.050> doesn't<00:03:31.410> do<00:03:31.500> much<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.950> all

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
one it really doesn't do much at all

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.040 
one it really doesn't do much at all
when<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.150> compare<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.630> some<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> other

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
when you compare it to some of the other

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.850 
when you compare it to some of the other
ones<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.040> r<00:03:35.340> MK<00:03:35.970> dash<00:03:36.360> two<00:03:36.810> grenade<00:03:37.200> if<00:03:37.380> you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
ones so r MK dash two grenade if you

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.710 
ones so r MK dash two grenade if you
throw<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.250> obviously<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.940> makes<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.360> bit<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
throw it obviously it makes a bit of a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.080 
throw it obviously it makes a bit of a
bigger<00:03:39.900> hole<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.709> see<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.850> makes

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
bigger hole as you can see it it makes

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.550 
bigger hole as you can see it it makes
it<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.330> little<00:03:42.510> bit<00:03:42.750> easier<00:03:43.110> going<00:03:43.290> through

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it a little bit easier going through

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.740 
it a little bit easier going through
stone<00:03:43.860> obviously<00:03:44.430> these<00:03:44.820> really<00:03:45.390> aren't<00:03:45.600> for

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
stone obviously these really aren't for

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.540 
stone obviously these really aren't for
mining<00:03:46.050> but<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.040> shows<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.400> how

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
mining but it just shows you how

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.080 
mining but it just shows you how
powerful<00:03:48.060> they<00:03:48.209> are<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:49.200> our<00:03:49.440> m<00:03:49.709> dash<00:03:50.130> 67

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
powerful they are and then our m dash 67

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.520 
powerful they are and then our m dash 67
is<00:03:51.180> obviously<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.570> most<00:03:51.810> powerful<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
is obviously the most powerful so if I

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.620 
is obviously the most powerful so if I
go<00:03:52.560> ahead<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.920> throw<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.390> saw<00:03:54.570> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
go ahead and throw that as you saw the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.680 
go ahead and throw that as you saw the
smart<00:03:55.140> smoke<00:03:55.500> particles<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.220> lot<00:03:57.000> wider<00:03:57.269> area

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
smart smoke particles a lot wider area

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.960 
smart smoke particles a lot wider area
the<00:03:58.200> sand<00:03:58.500> starts<00:03:58.800> falling<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.700> can

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
the sand starts falling and you can

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.430 
the sand starts falling and you can
really<00:04:00.360> start<00:04:00.690> digging<00:04:01.019> down<00:04:01.110> properly

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
really start digging down properly

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.890 
really start digging down properly
because<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.830> one<00:04:02.040> has<00:04:02.160> quite<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.269> lot<00:04:03.660> of

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
because this one has quite a lot of

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.810 
because this one has quite a lot of
power<00:04:04.320> however<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.130> one<00:04:05.280> thing<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.580> do<00:04:05.640> like

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
power however the one thing I do like

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.370 
power however the one thing I do like
about<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.300> mod<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:07.110> something

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
about this mod is it's not something

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.199 
about this mod is it's not something
like<00:04:07.500> explosives<00:04:08.190> plus<00:04:08.370> where<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.060> only

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
like explosives plus where you only

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.580 
like explosives plus where you only
install<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.900> muck<00:04:10.080> around<00:04:10.200> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
install just a muck around and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.680 
install just a muck around and
completely<00:04:10.890> mess<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.400> your<00:04:11.550> world<00:04:11.820> but<00:04:12.600> you

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
completely mess up your world but you

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.120 
completely mess up your world but you
can<00:04:12.840> actually<00:04:12.959> use<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.380> in<00:04:13.590> single<00:04:14.100> player

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
can actually use this in single player

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550 
can actually use this in single player
and<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.549> does<00:04:14.700> actually<00:04:14.790> have<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> purpose<00:04:15.560> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and it does actually have a purpose it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.770 
and it does actually have a purpose it
kind<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.919> War<00:04:17.609> reenactments<00:04:18.330> maybe<00:04:18.510> there's<00:04:18.720> a

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
kind of War reenactments maybe there's a

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.080 
kind of War reenactments maybe there's a
server<00:04:19.109> where<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.100> like<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> war<00:04:20.580> server

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
server where it's like a war server

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.090 
server where it's like a war server
that'd<00:04:21.419> be<00:04:21.540> pretty<00:04:21.660> cool<00:04:21.780> where<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.710> have<00:04:22.860> two

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
that'd be pretty cool where you have two

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.950 
that'd be pretty cool where you have two
sides<00:04:23.340> fighting<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:24.000> gate<00:04:24.150> against<00:04:24.720> each<00:04:24.810> other

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
sides fighting a gate against each other

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.050 
sides fighting a gate against each other
and<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.200> get<00:04:25.410> grenades<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.010> think<00:04:26.520> this<00:04:26.610> mod<00:04:26.820> is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and you get grenades I think this mod is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.730 
and you get grenades I think this mod is
compatible<00:04:27.750> with<00:04:27.870> service<00:04:28.350> so<00:04:28.470> if<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.620> want

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
compatible with service so if you want

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.440 
compatible with service so if you want
to<00:04:28.770> go<00:04:28.860> ahead<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.160> do<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:30.300> would<00:04:30.330> be

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
to go ahead and do that that would be

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.380 
to go ahead and do that that would be
really<00:04:30.630> kind<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.990> fun

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
really kind of fun

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.870 
really kind of fun
so<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.530> do<00:04:32.620> actually<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.190> this<00:04:33.400> mod<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> fact

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
so I do actually like this mod the fact

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.340 
so I do actually like this mod the fact
that<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.120> uses<00:04:34.420> gunpowder<00:04:34.780> because<00:04:35.260> obviously

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
that it uses gunpowder because obviously

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.050 
that it uses gunpowder because obviously
you<00:04:35.770> kill<00:04:36.040> creepers<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.610> should<00:04:36.880> get

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
you kill creepers you should get

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.880 
you kill creepers you should get
something<00:04:37.390> better<00:04:37.540> from<00:04:37.900> creepers<00:04:38.230> than<00:04:38.710> just

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
something better from creepers than just

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.250 
something better from creepers than just
a<00:04:38.980> tiny<00:04:39.190> bit<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.520> gunpowder<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.390> then<00:04:41.170> you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
a tiny bit of gunpowder and then you

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.440 
a tiny bit of gunpowder and then you
just<00:04:41.410> get<00:04:41.590> one<00:04:41.860> block<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.280> TNT<00:04:42.730> with<00:04:43.150> 5

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
just get one block of TNT with 5

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.260 
just get one block of TNT with 5
gunpowder<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.230> really<00:04:44.830> isn't<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.730> much<00:04:45.880> of

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
gunpowder and really isn't that much of

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.060 
gunpowder and really isn't that much of
a<00:04:46.390> gift<00:04:46.630> from<00:04:46.960> killing<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.500> creeper<00:04:47.920> which

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
a gift from killing a creeper which

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.440 
a gift from killing a creeper which
really<00:04:48.340> should<00:04:48.550> get<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.670> medal<00:04:48.880> every<00:04:49.090> time<00:04:49.360> you

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
really should get a medal every time you

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.750 
really should get a medal every time you
kill<00:04:49.630> one<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.770> does<00:04:50.890> add<00:04:51.040> some<00:04:51.250> more<00:04:51.400> usage

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
kill one so it does add some more usage

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.390 
kill one so it does add some more usage
which<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.480> think<00:04:52.840> are<00:04:53.020> quite<00:04:53.380> cool<00:04:53.650> however<00:04:54.280> the

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
which I think are quite cool however the

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.670 
which I think are quite cool however the
models<00:04:54.790> are<00:04:54.940> not<00:04:55.750> really<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.200> good<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.440> mean

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
models are not really that good I mean

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800 
models are not really that good I mean
they're<00:04:57.130> nice<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.550> 2d<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.210> they<00:04:58.360> look<00:04:58.630> the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
they're nice and 2d and they look the

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.930 
they're nice and 2d and they look the
part<00:04:58.990> however<00:04:59.620> if<00:04:59.740> they<00:04:59.890> were<00:04:59.950> 3d<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.790> when

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940
