00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.910
 which always confuses me a bit 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.710
 is the whole story around the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.000
 boateng-brothers that's a bit 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.210
 That's why I'll stop you 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 explain a bit 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 we once have the giro 's name 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:27.060
 actually like to write I know 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:29.130
 not written so well again and then 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:37.920
 we have kevin prince 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.730
 that's really what it means 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 you can say 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 they do not look alike 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.680
 totally different because you have to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.059
 they both do not say the same 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 mother but the same father 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:53.670
 the curious thing is the play 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.079
 both at the wm but not in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.329
 same crew caught rome 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 plays germany and kevin 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 prince at ghana plays at ghana and there 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.559
 I wonder why do not play 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 together with germany that has one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.909
 Well, what was that again from knew it 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.960
 So first you can say that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.970
 are definitely not together 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.720
 Growing up because kevin-prince is at 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 the mother grew up and threatened with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:30.490
 father 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:32.320
 so what does rom play in germany and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 kevin-prince plays at ghana already 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.350
 always I do not always believe he has 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 sometimes somewhere in the youth 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.310
 Team in Germany played only 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.570
 16 u 21 team and there is 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.100
 something has happened and then it is 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.659
 I think was kicked out and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.150
 that's why he said okay hey me 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.680
 I have another citizenship 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:56.170
 because she can not channel no 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.649
 Ghanaian maybe not even 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.460
 Not 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:04.020
 he would not have said anything 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.640
 Iranian citizenship and therefore 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.410
 and therefore he can also say okay 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.060
 then really great Germany I play 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.440
 now at ghana for him it's pretty much 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440
 stupid because germany yes better than 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 ghana because i say now 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.209
 not so because they are better at that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.560
 actually only have a relationship 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.989
 contact with each other I do not think so 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.019
 or a sexual relationship that we 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.190
 we are so interested in something 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.579
 we have learned the two have the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.410
 father 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.410
 you have to know more or more
