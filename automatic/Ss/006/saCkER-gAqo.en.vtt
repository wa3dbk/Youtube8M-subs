00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.600
 the wm now for three years and 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.290
 program with eight weeks all up 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.520
 become small 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.289
 they are very musicians and yet they are 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.160
 really very friendly very much 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.490
 loving oneself has to be a lot 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.650
 sunshine 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.110
 But from the beginning we had everything 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.240
 strong health problems so 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.369
 she has a relative I would have her 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.590
 have gotten with his skin whole 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.440
 problem that heartier and scratched and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.899
 bitten, the field looked quite dull 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.120
 I was with the paws very much 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.769
 very great on bitten in addition to that 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.870
 The ears are constantly under 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.739
 inflamed thereby conditionally very 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 a lot at the vet 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.359
 We then yes, then test it 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.269
 leave because of the difficulty 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.069
 test feed allergy directly 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.050
 So what exactly but first 

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.819
 against environmental influences but tested that 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.609
 but it was all negative so definitely 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.319
 allergy with feed and she must 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.879
 we are holding ever more expensive negotiations 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:06.350
 have yes then switched to local and 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.330
 which in any case very positive for her 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.469
 to put that was she has a lot else 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.930
 eaten slowly 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.460
 it was already day too long too 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 her key with fodder days stood it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.320
 then ate the first time 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.960
 positive what noticed immediately 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.810
 it tasted great when it's totally it 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.509
 are they now doing in demand empty 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.869
 eaten and she loves it just fed up 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.950
 then lasted a while, but 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.000
 now they were has no 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.590
 more problems 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.679
 she does not scratch herself she bites herself 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.179
 not and what among the other photos 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.500
 weeks gone is also the 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.520
 Otitis in complete 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 stopped 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.880
 it has become much more active 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.829
 we also had the problem by the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.630
 other feeds take care of them 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.649
 he has increased 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.780
 meanwhile the daily ration 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.039
 always well taken off now 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.479
 now her optimal weight and is 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.609
 accordingly, she feels more comfortable 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.000
 You can tell that clearly she jumps me 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:03.289
 rum so they just shuffle more balanced 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.390
 joy in life 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.039
 meanwhile we can assert ourselves 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.039
 have healthy all around now
