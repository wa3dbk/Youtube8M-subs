wall custom-built we talked about as
possible<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.810> environment<00:01:55.320> right<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
possible the environment right in the

middle<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.250> wall<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.330> didn't<00:01:57.750> confirm

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
middle of the wall but I didn't confirm

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.170 
middle of the wall but I didn't confirm
the<00:01:58.230> request<00:01:58.580> because<00:01:59.580> I'm<00:01:59.730> an<00:01:59.850> idiot

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the request because I'm an idiot

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.920 
the request because I'm an idiot
so<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.170> didn't<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.680> done<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.090> mesh<00:02:03.270> itself<00:02:03.480> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so I didn't get done the mesh itself is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.650 
so I didn't get done the mesh itself is
about<00:02:04.200> two<00:02:04.500> inch<00:02:04.710> square<00:02:05.010> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.850> just

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
about two inch square which is just

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.440 
about two inch square which is just
small<00:02:07.170> enough<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.740> an<00:02:07.800> Indian<00:02:08.070> scopz<00:02:08.490> but<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
small enough for an Indian scopz but I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.480 
small enough for an Indian scopz but I
probably<00:02:09.780> wouldn't<00:02:10.290> put<00:02:10.440> any<00:02:10.619> small<00:02:10.979> roles<00:02:11.250> in

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
probably wouldn't put any small roles in

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.180 
probably wouldn't put any small roles in
you<00:02:12.170> don't<00:02:13.170> lightly<00:02:13.470> squeeze<00:02:13.830> through<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you don't lightly squeeze through the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
gaps and skip the floor is a combination

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.140 
gaps and skip the floor is a combination
of<00:02:18.660> P<00:02:18.870> shingle<00:02:19.290> from<00:02:19.470> Wix<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.790> patio

of P shingle from Wix and the patio
slabs<00:02:21.420> were<00:02:21.720> from<00:02:21.990> company<00:02:22.350> called<00:02:22.590> easy<00:02:22.920> pave

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.330 

since<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.769> video<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.069> filmed<00:02:29.519> I've<00:02:30.269> added<00:02:30.540> a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
since the video was filmed I've added a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.399 
since the video was filmed I've added a
feeding<00:02:32.340> platform<00:02:32.549> just<00:02:33.360> inside<00:02:33.780> viewing<00:02:34.230> hat

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
feeding platform just inside viewing hat

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.500 
feeding platform just inside viewing hat
so<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:35.040> leave<00:02:35.220> her<00:02:35.459> my<00:02:35.670> stare<00:02:35.970> at<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:36.269> dish

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
so I can leave her my stare at my dish

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.860 
so I can leave her my stare at my dish
she's<00:02:37.379> not<00:02:37.530> gonna<00:02:37.709> get<00:02:38.040> himself<00:02:38.659> I've<00:02:39.659> added
