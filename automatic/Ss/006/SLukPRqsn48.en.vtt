00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.900
 but today I want to show you the two methods 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:11.380
 for sky and the chapter in a natural way 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.809
 since I don't have the webcam on the mountain pc 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 I do it on my cell phone 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.320
 as you can see I don't even wear make-up 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.800
 so please don't judge yours 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.760
 method 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:29.590
 I tried chamomile as a last 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:35.620
 I rinse and and I think it's very good 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:40.489
 because it makes the hair very clean and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:44.149
 no fluffy ie soft and the 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.640
 chamomile practically the find 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.449
 inside a plastic bottle leaves 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.719
 all night and the next day after it 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.210
 shampoo and conditioner do as a lot 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.750
 this one with the family and fails 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.539
 to how many with water and it's very good 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.170
 because possible hair apart from those 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:10.250
 dark that will not be clarified on time 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.640
 do not write because it is natural in one and not 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.960
 change inside the hair and the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.819
 second method is beer beer 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.729
 practically it is also to put up for 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:26.149
 lighten the hair very naturally and 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.610
 very good because this also makes i 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:33.530
 very soft hair and I do not tell you one 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.409
 shit applies after one's own first 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.020
 of the shampoo the balm evening acts then 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.890
 and then I wash it off while you do it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.890
 shampoo and conditioner 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.390
 the effects will not be seen immediately but 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.640
 after a little simple you do with 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.970
 these natural ways you will see the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 Unlike oh well I wrote my hair 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.040
 first thing discoloration and after now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.750
 I decided to do it in a natural way so 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.090
 that the blond by bleaching 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.800
 even more systemic for blondes is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 very good because being blondes 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.110
 clears even more in the hat 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.740
 brighter but also for brunette women 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.480
 medium brown and that I am clear as 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.210
 said for black hair is not that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.860
 It acts very however if you want to be used bit 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.040
 because anyway the hair is soft and then 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.040
 what to say 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.250
 nothing I saw these videos move 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.740
 I did n't invent methods on the internet 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.040
 I just wanted to let you know 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.040
 however if you try then tell me how 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.040
