00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
talk about is the ability of the catfish

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
talk about is the ability of the catfish
to<00:00:20.429> smell<00:00:21.429> see<00:00:22.150> and<00:00:22.560> taste<00:00:23.849> under<00:00:24.849> water<00:00:25.060> so

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
to smell see and taste under water so

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.450 
to smell see and taste under water so
first<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.339> all<00:00:27.400> let's<00:00:27.640> talk<00:00:28.089> about<00:00:28.150> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
first of all let's talk about the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.060 
first of all let's talk about the
catfish<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:31.800> its<00:00:32.800> ability<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.310> see<00:00:35.070> catfish

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
catfish and its ability to see catfish

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.270 
catfish and its ability to see catfish
are<00:00:36.550> nocturnal<00:00:37.180> they<00:00:37.570> are<00:00:38.469> known<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.950> feed<00:00:39.129> at

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
are nocturnal they are known to feed at

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.990 
are nocturnal they are known to feed at
night<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.050> us<00:00:41.170> know<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.590> but<00:00:41.890> most<00:00:42.760> a

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
night most of us know that but most a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.139 
night most of us know that but most a
lot<00:00:43.210> of<00:00:43.329> us<00:00:43.420> don't<00:00:43.600> know<00:00:43.719> why<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.670> reason<00:00:45.699> for

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
lot of us don't know why the reason for

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.650 
lot of us don't know why the reason for
that<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.510> catfish<00:00:47.320> have<00:00:47.590> an<00:00:47.829> imbalance<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
that is catfish have an imbalance of the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.439 
that is catfish have an imbalance of the
rods<00:00:50.469> and<00:00:50.649> cones<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.910> eye<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:55.059> have<00:00:55.239> more

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
rods and cones in the eye they have more

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.880 
rods and cones in the eye they have more
cones<00:00:55.809> than<00:00:56.140> rods<00:00:56.469> which<00:00:58.410> allows<00:00:59.410> them<00:00:59.680> to

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
cones than rods which allows them to

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.170 
cones than rods which allows them to
have<00:01:00.070> better<00:01:00.370> night<00:01:00.699> vision<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.969> being

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
have better night vision so that being

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.630 
have better night vision so that being
said<00:01:04.269> when<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.900> sun<00:01:05.110> goes<00:01:05.140> down<00:01:05.560> their<00:01:05.950> vision

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
said when the sun goes down their vision

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.890 
said when the sun goes down their vision
becomes<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:09.100> better<00:01:09.400> than<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.479> would<00:01:10.720> be

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
becomes much better than it would be

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.670 
becomes much better than it would be
during<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.229> daytime<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.869> having<00:01:14.229> that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
during the daytime so having that

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.620 
during the daytime so having that
ability<00:01:14.860> along<00:01:15.490> with<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.729> other<00:01:15.909> ones<00:01:16.150> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
ability along with the other ones it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.929 
ability along with the other ones it
allows<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.770> feed<00:01:18.100> at<00:01:18.250> its<00:01:18.460> maximum

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
allows it to feed at its maximum

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.469 
allows it to feed at its maximum
potential

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
potential

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.530 
potential
another<00:01:22.479> thing<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:23.229> catfish<00:01:23.770> has<00:01:24.009> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
another thing that a catfish has is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:33.359 
another thing that a catfish has is
ability<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.720> taste<00:01:31.020> catfish<00:01:32.020> have<00:01:32.890> their

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
ability to taste catfish have their

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
ability to taste catfish have their
whiskers<00:01:33.880> let<00:01:34.810> me<00:01:34.899> show<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.140> here<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.649> course

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
as you can see these whiskers called

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.480 
as you can see these whiskers called
barbels<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.930> they<00:01:43.930> have<00:01:44.140> taste<00:01:44.470> buds<00:01:44.560> along

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
barbels and they have taste buds along

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.969 
barbels and they have taste buds along
here

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.550 

look<00:01:49.610> what<00:01:49.789> not<00:01:50.000> too<00:01:50.180> many<00:01:50.360> people<00:01:50.659> know<00:01:50.869> is

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that their entire body covered from head

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.590 
that their entire body covered from head
to<00:01:56.509> toe<00:01:57.189> is<00:01:58.189> covered<00:01:58.700> with<00:01:59.619> something<00:02:00.619> called

to toe is covered with something called

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.359 
to toe is covered with something called
chemoreceptors<00:02:03.189> basically<00:02:04.189> means<00:02:06.369> receptive

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
chemoreceptors basically means receptive

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
to chemicals in the water so when

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.830 
to chemicals in the water so when
fishing<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:13.060> some<00:02:14.060> kind<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.360> blood<00:02:14.599> bait

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
catfish can actually taste the water or

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.990 
catfish can actually taste the water or
it<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.530> tell<00:02:25.010> what's<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.519> the<00:02:25.610> water<00:02:25.760> by

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
it can tell what's in the water by

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150 
it can tell what's in the water by
tasting<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.720> by<00:02:26.959> tasting<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> chemicals<00:02:27.980> in

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
tasting that by tasting the chemicals in

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.190 
tasting that by tasting the chemicals in
the<00:02:28.190> water<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:29.120> if<00:02:29.269> your<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:29.930> baits

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the water so if your if your baits

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.920 
the water so if your if your baits
leaving<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> trail<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> blood<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.630> pick<00:02:32.780> up

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
leaving a trail of blood it can pick up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.259 
leaving a trail of blood it can pick up
that<00:02:33.079> scent<00:02:33.140> not<00:02:33.739> only<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.849> barbells

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
that scent not only with the barbells

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.210 
that scent not only with the barbells
but<00:02:35.690> also<00:02:36.500> along<00:02:36.980> its<00:02:37.250> whole<00:02:37.459> body<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.099> a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
but also along its whole body so it's a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.030 
but also along its whole body so it's a
if<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.700> catfish<00:02:41.090> touches<00:02:41.630> even<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.260> touches

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
if the catfish touches even a touches

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.589 
if the catfish touches even a touches
the<00:02:43.160> bait<00:02:43.340> with<00:02:43.549> its<00:02:43.760> tail<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:44.299> actually

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
the bait with its tail it's actually

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.130 
the bait with its tail it's actually
tasting<00:02:45.079> it<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.319> can<00:02:45.440> taste<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.930> being

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
tasting it it can taste it so that being

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.280 
tasting it it can taste it so that being
said<00:02:51.230> we're<00:02:52.220> gonna<00:02:52.310> move<00:02:52.549> on<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:54.250> hearing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
said we're gonna move on to hearing

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.099 
said we're gonna move on to hearing
catfish<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.440> also<00:02:57.560> hear<00:02:57.950> underwater<00:02:59.109> they

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
catfish can also hear underwater they

those vibrations in the water and
they're<00:03:50.319> ready<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.500> respond<00:03:51.889> and<00:03:52.069> go<00:03:52.190> find<00:03:52.489> it

they're ready to respond and go find it

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.470 
they're ready to respond and go find it
which<00:03:54.859> brings<00:03:55.069> me<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.930> do<00:03:56.930> catfish<00:03:57.379> get<00:03:57.829> scared

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
which brings me to do catfish get scared

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.720 
which brings me to do catfish get scared
when<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.629> make<00:03:59.840> noise<00:04:00.140> in<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.620> water

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
when you make noise in the water

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.149 
when you make noise in the water
well<00:04:02.730> that's<00:04:03.180> that's<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.319> big<00:04:04.500> controversy<00:04:04.860> I

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
well that's that's a big controversy I

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.149 
well that's that's a big controversy I
think<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.610> lot<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> people<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.920> know<00:04:08.040> they

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
think a lot of people you know they

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.369 
think a lot of people you know they
would<00:04:08.280> argue<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.640> some<00:04:09.090> would<00:04:09.629> say<00:04:09.810> yes<00:04:10.079> some

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
would argue that some would say yes some

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.420 
would argue that some would say yes some
would<00:04:10.500> say<00:04:10.739> no<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.909> my<00:04:12.659> experience<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.680> find

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
would say no in my experience I find

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.370 
would say no in my experience I find
that<00:04:16.160> noise<00:04:17.160> itself<00:04:17.789> does<00:04:18.299> not<00:04:18.539> scare<00:04:18.959> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
that noise itself does not scare the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.490 
that noise itself does not scare the
fish<00:04:21.380> my<00:04:22.380> personal<00:04:22.830> experience<00:04:23.310> when<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.580> go

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.840 
noise I always have a fishing rod out
and<00:04:39.300> there's<00:04:40.229> been<00:04:40.710> time<00:04:41.100> after<00:04:41.400> time<00:04:41.580> that<00:04:41.639> I

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
and there's been time after time that I

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.820 
and there's been time after time that I
have<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.210> swim<00:04:42.479> back<00:04:42.660> to<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.900> boat<00:04:43.199> grab<00:04:43.650> my

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
have to swim back to the boat grab my

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.920 
have to swim back to the boat grab my

rod because I'm getting a bite despite

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.120 
rod because I'm getting a bite despite
the<00:04:46.050> fact<00:04:46.289> that<00:04:46.350> we're<00:04:46.560> splashing<00:04:47.010> around

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
the fact that we're splashing around

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.129 
the fact that we're splashing around
making<00:04:47.610> all<00:04:47.729> this<00:04:47.850> noise<00:04:49.580> now<00:04:50.660> when<00:04:51.660> I've<00:04:51.840> gone

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
making all this noise now when I've gone

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.330 
making all this noise now when I've gone
to<00:04:52.199> places<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.610> water<00:04:53.849> is<00:04:54.000> clear<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:55.340> do

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
to places that the water is clear I do

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.430 
to places that the water is clear I do
see<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> catfish<00:04:57.240> get<00:04:57.419> spooked<00:04:58.699> but<00:04:59.699> I<00:05:00.440> think

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
see the catfish get spooked but I think

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.290 
see the catfish get spooked but I think
that<00:05:01.620> it's<00:05:01.770> because<00:05:02.130> they<00:05:02.430> can<00:05:02.610> actually<00:05:02.849> see

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
that it's because they can actually see

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.650 
that it's because they can actually see
when<00:05:04.199> we're<00:05:04.410> walking<00:05:04.590> up<00:05:04.970> they<00:05:05.970> see<00:05:06.210> us<00:05:06.360> over

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
when we're walking up they see us over

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.379 
when we're walking up they see us over
overhead<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.740> they<00:05:08.520> spook<00:05:08.849> not<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.240> much

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
overhead and they spook not so much

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.640 
overhead and they spook not so much
because<00:05:09.510> of<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.810> noise<00:05:10.490> now<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.550> know<00:05:12.349> if<00:05:13.349> you

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
because of the noise now you know if you

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.159 
because of the noise now you know if you
do<00:05:13.860> hand<00:05:14.160> fishing<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:16.050> flathead<00:05:16.919> catfish

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
do hand fishing for flathead catfish

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.240 
do hand fishing for flathead catfish
obviously<00:05:19.169> they<00:05:19.349> don't<00:05:19.590> get<00:05:19.710> spooked<00:05:20.070> with

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
obviously they don't get spooked with

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.070 
obviously they don't get spooked with
noise<00:05:20.490> because<00:05:20.849> you're<00:05:21.060> you're<00:05:21.659> splashing

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
noise because you're you're splashing

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.149 
noise because you're you're splashing
around<00:05:22.169> in<00:05:22.409> there<00:05:22.560> getting<00:05:22.770> in<00:05:22.949> there<00:05:23.099> of

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
around in there getting in there of

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.700 
around in there getting in there of
course<00:05:23.370> you're<00:05:23.460> trying<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.880> quiet<00:05:24.320> but<00:05:25.320> you

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
course you're trying to be quiet but you

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.089 
course you're trying to be quiet but you
know<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:27.210> sound<00:05:27.659> carries<00:05:29.090> underwater<00:05:30.889> but<00:05:31.889> a

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
know that sound carries underwater but a

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.040 
know that sound carries underwater but a
lot<00:05:32.340> easier<00:05:32.370> than<00:05:32.699> it<00:05:32.820> does<00:05:33.000> in<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.270> air<00:05:33.539> so

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
lot easier than it does in the air so

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.290 
lot easier than it does in the air so
they<00:05:35.039> know<00:05:35.220> you're<00:05:35.400> there<00:05:35.580> they<00:05:35.849> hear<00:05:36.150> you

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
they know you're there they hear you

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.240 
they know you're there they hear you
they<00:05:36.570> hear<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.900> walking<00:05:37.320> in<00:05:37.500> they<00:05:37.710> they<00:05:37.919> hear

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
they hear you walking in they they hear

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.550 
they hear you walking in they they hear
the<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.490> splashes<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:41.360> they<00:05:42.500> they<00:05:43.500> don't

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
the little splashes so they they don't

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.330 
the little splashes so they they don't
spook<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.720> from<00:05:46.380> my<00:05:46.530> experience<00:05:46.979> I<00:05:47.130> don't

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
spook so from my experience I don't

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.050 
spook so from my experience I don't
think<00:05:47.550> it's<00:05:47.760> so<00:05:48.090> much<00:05:49.370> sound<00:05:50.370> that<00:05:50.699> scares<00:05:50.970> a

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
think it's so much sound that scares a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.939 
think it's so much sound that scares a
fish<00:05:51.360> as<00:05:51.599> much<00:05:51.630> as<00:05:51.840> sight<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.530> will<00:05:52.680> scare<00:05:52.889> a

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
fish as much as sight that will scare a

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.890 
fish as much as sight that will scare a
fish<00:05:53.250> all<00:05:53.970> right<00:05:54.090> one<00:05:54.270> other<00:05:54.300> thing<00:05:54.690> that<00:05:54.720> I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
fish all right one other thing that I

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.750 
fish all right one other thing that I
wanted<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.169> mention<00:05:55.349> to<00:05:55.620> you<00:05:55.650> guys<00:05:55.919> before<00:05:56.250> I

wanted to mention to you guys before I

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.279 
wanted to mention to you guys before I
forget<00:05:57.659> about<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.110> is<00:05:58.560> I've<00:05:59.280> always<00:05:59.550> wondered

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
forget about it is I've always wondered

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.379 
forget about it is I've always wondered
what<00:06:01.289> the<00:06:01.500> purpose<00:06:01.889> of<00:06:02.210> this<00:06:03.210> little<00:06:03.630> fin<00:06:05.389> that

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
what the purpose of this little fin that

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.640 
what the purpose of this little fin that
the<00:06:06.510> catfish<00:06:06.900> have

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
the catfish have

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.150 
the catfish have
yes<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.430> all<00:06:10.819> these<00:06:10.970> catfish<00:06:11.389> have<00:06:11.599> it<00:06:12.160> it's

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
yes and all these catfish have it it's

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.370 
yes and all these catfish have it it's
that<00:06:13.370> little<00:06:13.550> fleshy<00:06:13.970> fin<00:06:14.419> that<00:06:14.750> they<00:06:14.900> have<00:06:15.139> it

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
that little fleshy fin that they have it

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.040 
that little fleshy fin that they have it
looks<00:06:15.560> different<00:06:15.770> from<00:06:15.979> all<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.340> other<00:06:16.490> ones

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
looks different from all the other ones

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.170 
looks different from all the other ones
and<00:06:18.050> I've<00:06:18.919> always<00:06:19.160> wondered<00:06:19.400> what<00:06:19.610> it<00:06:19.729> was<00:06:19.940> for

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
and I've always wondered what it was for

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.749 
and I've always wondered what it was for
and<00:06:20.509> I<00:06:21.229> finally<00:06:21.830> learned<00:06:22.099> what<00:06:22.220> it<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.520> it's

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
and I finally learned what it is it's

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.040 
and I finally learned what it is it's
called<00:06:22.940> an<00:06:23.150> adipose<00:06:23.750> fin<00:06:24.139> and<00:06:25.720> it's<00:06:26.720> actually

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
called an adipose fin and it's actually

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.020 
called an adipose fin and it's actually
also<00:06:27.289> found<00:06:27.500> on<00:06:27.620> salmon<00:06:28.099> and<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.759> reason<00:06:29.000> for

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
also found on salmon and the reason for

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.930 
also found on salmon and the reason for
it<00:06:29.270> is<00:06:29.509> it<00:06:29.690> helps<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.349> fish<00:06:30.919> maneuver<00:06:31.699> and

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
it is it helps the fish maneuver and

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.700 
it is it helps the fish maneuver and
navigate<00:06:32.630> in<00:06:33.430> turbulent<00:06:34.430> waters<00:06:34.819> so<00:06:35.710> catfish

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
navigate in turbulent waters so catfish

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.430 
navigate in turbulent waters so catfish
can<00:06:36.889> actually<00:06:37.280> be<00:06:37.460> in<00:06:37.690> fast-moving<00:06:38.690> water<00:06:39.050> and

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
can actually be in fast-moving water and

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.360 
can actually be in fast-moving water and
that<00:06:40.130> little<00:06:40.520> bitty<00:06:40.759> fin<00:06:41.229> helps<00:06:42.229> them<00:06:42.440> get

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
that little bitty fin helps them get

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.219 
that little bitty fin helps them get
through<00:06:43.430> there<00:06:43.849> so<00:06:44.150> just<00:06:44.720> something<00:06:45.020> for<00:06:45.110> you

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
guys in case you were wondering but in

closing I just want you to reflect on

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.939 
closing I just want you to reflect on
what<00:06:52.069> we've<00:06:52.190> talked<00:06:52.430> about<00:06:52.520> in<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.949> catfish

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
what we've talked about in the catfish

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.180 
what we've talked about in the catfish
ability<00:06:55.430> to<00:06:55.520> taste<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:57.110> water<00:06:57.380> itself<00:06:57.889> the

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
ability to taste the water itself the

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.809 
ability to taste the water itself the
chemicals<00:06:58.639> in<00:06:58.759> the<00:06:58.880> water<00:06:59.949> it's<00:07:00.949> covered<00:07:01.400> from

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819 
chemicals in the water it's covered from

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.110 
chemicals in the water it's covered from
head<00:07:01.940> to<00:07:02.060> toe<00:07:02.240> with<00:07:03.310> chemoreceptors<00:07:04.340> most

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
head to toe with chemoreceptors most

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.149 
head to toe with chemoreceptors most
similar<00:07:05.300> to<00:07:05.449> taste<00:07:05.750> buds<00:07:06.020> so<00:07:06.770> they<00:07:06.949> can

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
similar to taste buds so they can

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.950 
similar to taste buds so they can
actually<00:07:07.490> taste<00:07:08.030> the<00:07:08.210> bait<00:07:08.389> before<00:07:08.720> they<00:07:08.870> even

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
actually taste the bait before they even

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.950 
actually taste the bait before they even
get<00:07:09.349> to<00:07:09.560> it<00:07:09.729> they<00:07:10.729> can<00:07:10.940> follow<00:07:11.449> the<00:07:11.750> scent

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
get to it they can follow the scent

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.870 
get to it they can follow the scent
trail<00:07:12.080> through<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.560> water<00:07:12.770> they<00:07:13.639> have

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:13.880 
trail through the water they have

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.450 
trail through the water they have
excellent<00:07:14.810> night<00:07:15.110> vision<00:07:15.250> that's<00:07:16.250> why

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
excellent night vision that's why

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.020 
excellent night vision that's why
they're<00:07:16.639> nocturnal<00:07:17.090> and<00:07:18.219> they<00:07:19.219> can<00:07:19.490> sense<00:07:19.849> the

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.030 
they're nocturnal and they can sense the

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.339 
they're nocturnal and they can sense the
vibrations<00:07:20.599> in<00:07:20.750> the<00:07:20.780> water

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:21.349 
vibrations in the water

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.360 
vibrations in the water
