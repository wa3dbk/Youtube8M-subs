Phoenician<00:01:24.450> cream<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:25.440> is<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> same

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
Phoenician cream which is just the same

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.890

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
as it goes in the Boston cream and I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
as it goes in the Boston cream and I
thought<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.159> better<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.060> had<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
thought would be better if it had a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
thought would be better if it had a
chopped<00:01:31.229> peanut<00:01:31.560> butter<00:01:31.680> filling<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.970> have

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
chopped peanut butter filling so we have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.420 
chopped peanut butter filling so we have
the<00:01:33.270> fluff<00:01:33.509> filling<00:01:34.470> from<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> Oreo<00:01:35.100> doughnut

the fluff filling from the Oreo doughnut

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
the fluff filling from the Oreo doughnut

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I suggested that we whip that up with

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
I suggested that we whip that up with
some<00:01:37.470> peanut<00:01:37.740> butter<00:01:37.830> put<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> inside<00:01:38.970> see
