00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.069
 It's one thing to be afraid of something that 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.230
 you see through the internet but always 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.469
 with the balm of knowing that you are 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.860
 except after a monitor very different thing 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.390
 on the other hand is to live it yourself or you 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.910
 same experience where you are with 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.330
 friends or if you have a lot of courage in 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.220
 loneliness 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.440
 you go and it turns out that today is your opportunity 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.520
 to climb a ladder on the ladder 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.610
 dark today if you want you can take 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.440
 things a little further but 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.690
 beforehand I warn you to do what 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.710
 you are about to see you can get to 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.770
 frighten you deeply 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.620
 it was global trend on twitter you were 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.199
 known as the challenge is charly 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 simple it is a variation of the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.820
 Ouija game but much more 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.800
 creepy because there is no need 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.280
 that you put your fingers on anything 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.059
 in this case the object in question is 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.059
 will move alone 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.890
 despite the fact that millions of people 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.719
 they think that this macabre game is 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.210
 simpler version but much more 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.100
 terrific game of ouija is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.079
 is about invoking an entity called 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.270
 charlie the truth is that it is older 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.039
 many people were already playing this 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 before it became fashionable 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:32.100
 rechristened the challenge of charly 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 nevertheless the modern origin that they have 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.640
 given is very interesting or maybe the game 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.040
 he always had this story and now it's 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.820
 when you really know it says well 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.010
 charly is an ancient Mexican game a 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.340
 traditional ritual to contact a 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.020
 ghost called charlie what people 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 that has not been educated on issues 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.840
 paranormal and research on 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 demonology ignore however is 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.250
 what is really calling us a 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.620
 friendly spirit called charlie but 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.520
 that is actually invoking 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:13.130
 several demons these entities seem 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 friendly at first but they have 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.030
 sinister plans if you do not leave 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.940
 appropriately of charly in quotation marks 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.880
 you will experience rare situations 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.500
 how to hear voices things being moved 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.660
 in your house 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 strange shadows laughs or even more 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.239
 depending on the environment this game does not 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.280
 it's good and I advise nobody to play it 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.380
 unless they know very well that they are 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.590
 doing well if you do not say goodbye 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.870
 appropriately of charly then you're 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.730
 inviting a demon with the chaos that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.959
 it means 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.450
 to your house spread the word charlie is not 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.060
 a friendly ghost is a powerful 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.540
 entity and to be able to fire you 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.080
 appropriately of him you should say charly 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.390
 charly we can stop when the pencils 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.140
 move independently of what 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.040
 say take the throw them to the ground and say 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.640
 goodbye if you do not do this you are leaving a 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.130
 open portal 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.340
 if you want to play it yourself or yourself 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.330
 the instructions are simple pick up a 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.790
 piece of paper 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.790
 draw two lines so that the sheet 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.010
 is divided into four sectors 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.450
 in each space of the top 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.730
 assigns a yes and next to each the same beam 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.010
 underneath until it looks like you're seeing 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.439
 onscreen 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.540
 then he gets two pencils and 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.319
 place them carefully in the form of 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.959
 cross over the center of the paper 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.670
 again how do you see in the image 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.980
 all that remains to be done is a 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.590
 simple question one that can be 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.209
 answer dry with a yes or a no 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.000
 and wait for the answer if you want you can 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.140
 say the name charly twice before 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.210
 to pose the question 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.770
 for example 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.560
 charly charly you are here if you want 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.550
 play the classic version just make 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.230
 a question on the air 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.720
 again I warn you that if you have 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.760
 success you can feel extremely 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.970
 disturbed like thousands of people who 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.700
 they uploaded videos to twitter some of 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.590
 done show people who fainted or 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.169
 they just could not help but scream and 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.090
 leave terrified below in the 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.130
 description you placed several links 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.020
 so you can see the results that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.139
 got so that you know what to expect 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.470
 this challenge if you dare to do it 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.090
 during a very sober result is a 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.340
 just ask what are you going to do to a 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.970
 supposed spectrum that materializes there 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.580
 with you it may be you are simply here 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.270
 like some other intimate thing you want 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.280
 Know what you give your criteria 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.560
 Now that I've told you what the 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.580
