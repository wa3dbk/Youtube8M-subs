00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.250
 4 0 against celtic who would have thought that in advance 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.639
 but the truth for the winter break on foot already said 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.829
 But it is, however, saying this is unbelievable 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 giving a foretaste no real chance to 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.599
 we just scored celebrating, he says yes 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.809
 I have rarely played such a good match with a 10 judge there 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.119
 to enjoy 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 then you come very quickly to 0 2 0 2 penalties 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.410
 how do you stand in the field 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 He saw that all minority functions but well the return of Gaver also come 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.310
 not 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.270
 five 40 meters long but when you see the images everyone had to tonight 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.300
 to win 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.670
 omg to come to an ipod haze that we fought so hard for last year 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.340
 yes that will was present from everyone and until the last minute we stayed 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.420
 they go and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 yes we have fought our way to the match with very good football 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.260
 I think 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.140
 yes it is really a great achievement 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.260
 Sometimes you can say that the opponent is not good that was a lot for sale though 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.800
 this was also just very good 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.660
 yes the target is from celtic big names have said from last year as ajax and 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.970
 feyenoord lost and psv and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570
 they are now ajax 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 we just go beyond losing nothing 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.600
 yes and if you then frost twice in peace then you know that you actually still 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.020
 you have nothing you need to clear up the backlog 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.300
 But you still need Korea well 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.810
 then you are as keen as today in a market where you arrive as you have since 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 short a goal 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.090
 yes that is unbelievable 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.640
 on the draw 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.650
 yes we are in the minus in the polka dot jersey buses 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.619
 yes I am curious what kind of matches hit but well it is really one 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 achieved reasonably good performance 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.580
 in a European context for three times 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.420
 hell yes 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.299
 6 went after the great evening so everything was well unpacked plaice great 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.130
 done when you see how it is fiercely criticized and actually very moderate 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.340
 that is not caused by that bad play anyway but that we could 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.900
 results were opposite 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.920
 there was even a good pick up you are very quickly busy with 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 driven away by the 2 to make both penalties how are you behind a ball 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.989
 the second time 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.279
 today is coming we will also feel when black pieten are staring at 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.009
 had enough of it and the rooy also has something on that will be all right he will 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.009
 band together again but a also its place of hard enough 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.379
 why found 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.099
 there is of course a great goal 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.709
 I scold that only then comes with a 2 0 behind it must be whole 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.099
 what happen here you want to get through and 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.120
 I know that something that all Russian opponents of course continues to play well 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.599
 after Celtic and Marwijk then plays 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 it is of course great feeling and then start enjoying ing 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.309
 that helps such an audience as today 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.919
 yes an unintended audience is waiting so we first thought the oil was out 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.679
 looking forward to not being full 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.279
 he welcomes you there i felt a nasty atmosphere and the tiles soak too 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.029
 assisted 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.619
 and that it can stay that way to eat and of course it's great 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:59.689
 play football 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.839
 if this is the swirling gallows we do 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.339
 yes i must have been the supporters 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.339
 for the compliment that presents itself here today and 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.669
 that bayern you during that at the breakdown that group if you do 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.999
 free compliments but I think the group give a very big compliment 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.869
 that state 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:19.919
 have done huge customer loyalty 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.129
 yes because this is a crazy results 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.569
 yes if you are in advance 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.829
 Jozef of that where you win with a lot of celtic then 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.609
 drivers who enjoy going to agnietenstraat elsewhere in asia don't know 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.370
 well at your head march today I think away rightly and at times quite 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:37.259
 good field game 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.349
 then the communion the next phase 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.259
 the normal 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.529
 clubs in mind 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.529
 I have my club in mind that is one without twente 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.090
 and the best morning just goes to drive Jan Willem van Dop 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.329
 make premature birth possible 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.579
 and then we hear that tomorrow afternoon is also made possible 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.019
 and then the gaze is focused on again 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.559
 or twente Sunday 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.559
 You realize that this result is open to going 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.519
 too bad I like that 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.699
 everyone thought it was over 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.769
 two hopes this group points to women we have there is itself 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.989
 from just very well played only the two 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.449
 personal errors are already behind with 2 0 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.389
 but also outside it again, a well-played atmosphere with a little less 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.969
 the impression of 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.309
 quansah the misery and the club 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.739
 big name celtic but i think we are doing very well today very well 

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:28.979
 to have 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.259
 the champion on that twente 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.749
 at the point the champions with oak muslims arrange everything that is fit 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:36.199
 have some 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.930
 all drivers are 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.219
 which says you can beat homanshof irish 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.349
 but to the fact that year he 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.759
 for me is that i have is that has a large team but actually an extra 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.550
 time finding intertaste 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.029
 so you can also make it again 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.889
 yes, it was great, a man got seriously 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.150
 how stupid to fall in 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.200
 yes nice you are on three forward to work it goes very well with the 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.189
 plow to do well 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.209
 and yes I really do not want any goals he had to lose the car
