00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.669
 we have an acceleration problem 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.910
 clogging with oil in full 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:11.340
 power soaring hydrocarbons out 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 of the control range of the computer and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 this dirt in the valve and does in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.369
 this part of here here I already have 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.470
 disarmed previously removed the bolt 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.470
 from this position here 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.929
 the nuts are also 15 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.210
 pounds of pressure to other nuts and the 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.250
 cap screw 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.980
 let's do the disassembly of the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.079
 valve and make a motor one zz 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.449
 toyota 2002 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.909
 and we can appreciate here the amount of 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.710
 coal that is lodged in the 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.340
 full throttle throat 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.390
 power 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.080
 we have there we have a landslide 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.800
 clogging in the valve 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.010
 acceleration and we have excess input 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.469
 of oil towards him 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 the motor control there can be 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.710
 to appreciate 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.950
 in this set throat 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.420
 acceleration we have here the tps sensor 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.430
 what does it mean to bring by session 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.229
 sensors that detect the position of the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.930
 driver accelerator at the time 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.140
 to accelerate the engine then here 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.659
 we have vacuum aspiration motor 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.299
 towards the vent inlet of the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.820
 valve that looks like it's lodged here 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.440
 in this part of the lid of the of the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.350
 aim 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 then here in this part we have the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.890
 spring or body acceleration and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.020
 the mechanical acceleration that this at 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 General comes loaded from factory does not 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.390
 must readjust unless the 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.950
 Throat or butterfly is compensated 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.550
 in its acceleration and it no longer closes 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.350
 hermetically the body of the butterfly 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.950
 we can appreciate the packaging here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 back here 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.189
 here is the packaging that separates 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.280
 throttle throat manifold 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:08.560
 Engine intake I repeat to an engine 1 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 zz toyota toyota corolla here we can 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.420
 clearly appreciate coal as has been 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
 I have been lodging little by little because of the lack of 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.830
 maintenance of it and you can 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.010
 appreciate much more in here 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.770
 that there are oil receipts of what is being 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.600
 burning inside the motor then 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.690
 then what we are going to do 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.940
 here is simply and simply give you the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.340
 corrective maintenance that has to 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.110
 have from the beginning we have here the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.570
 hose that is 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.510
 of suction for the brake pump of 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.150
 engine here is the brake pump for 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.670
 the servo vasquez is called here takes 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.280
 the vacuum to generate vacuum in the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.390
 engine brake system and here 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.130
 we have fresh air aspiration towards 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.160
 the inside of the combustion engine 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.790
 internally we also have the system of 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.590
 ebap or system valve drain 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.390
 canister of emissions control 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.480
 evaporation of the fuel tank 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.750
 that this solenoid is on noi 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.080
 deactivated by the onboard computer 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.880
 bridge and release the gases that are 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.420
 are evaporating in the tank 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.190
 fuel lets them go again towards 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.780
 the inside of the combustion engine 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.030
 internal to maximize the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.239
 residual fuel that is found 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.239
 here
