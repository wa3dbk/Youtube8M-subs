00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
use one on this side I just used just

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.130 
use one on this side I just used just
the<00:01:35.189> spring<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.110> just<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.290> screws<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:39.140> this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the spring and just two screws and this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.660 
the spring and just two screws and this
mess<00:01:40.439> back<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.640> board<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:43.670> for

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
mess back here this board was just for

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.149 
mess back here this board was just for
added<00:01:44.909> strength<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.770> angle

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
added strength and then I put this angle

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.590 
added strength and then I put this angle
one<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.759> actually<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.180> better<00:01:48.360> for

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
one in here so it actually be better for

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200 
one in here so it actually be better for
that<00:01:48.630> angle<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:50.310> both<00:01:50.520> ways<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.060> it's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that angle one going both ways but it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
that angle one going both ways but it's
plenty<00:01:51.960> sturdy<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:54.439> this<00:01:55.439> single<00:01:55.939> Phillips

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
plenty sturdy and this single Phillips

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.160 
plenty sturdy and this single Phillips

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
head screw sets your off contact you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.539 
head screw sets your off contact you
need<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.189> take

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
need it to go up a little you just take

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.670 
need it to go up a little you just take
a<00:02:02.579> screwdriver<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.149> bring<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.439> down

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
a screwdriver and bring it up it go down

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.119 
a screwdriver and bring it up it go down
a<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.159> run<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> down<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.950> about<00:02:07.950> all

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
a little you run it down and about all

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.469 
a little you run it down and about all
there<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
there is to it

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.400 
there is to it
so<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> use<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> small<00:02:11.550> screen<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.470> take<00:02:15.410> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so if you use a small screen I take this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.610 
so if you use a small screen I take this
spring<00:02:16.709> off<00:02:17.040> makes<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> lot<00:02:17.879> less<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.620> lot

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
spring off makes it a lot less a lot

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.270 
spring off makes it a lot less a lot
less<00:02:19.680> tension<00:02:20.099> as<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.849> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.190> but<00:02:23.190> if

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
less tension as you can see and but if

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.380 
less tension as you can see and but if
I'm<00:02:23.459> using<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.879> big<00:02:24.290> screen<00:02:25.519> I'll<00:02:26.519> add<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.090> one

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
I'm using a big screen I'll add this one

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.210 
I'm using a big screen I'll add this one
and<00:02:29.540> works<00:02:30.540> pretty<00:02:30.750> good<00:02:31.050> I've<00:02:31.260> run<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.229 
have had little to no problem my only
recommendation<00:02:41.549> would<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:45.000> kind

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
recommendation would be to put some kind

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.740 
recommendation would be to put some kind
of<00:02:45.590> support<00:02:46.590> here<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.849> know<00:02:47.970> brace<00:02:48.329> here

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
of support here or you know brace here

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.339 
of support here or you know brace here
to<00:02:49.470> keep<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.160> from<00:02:50.549> moving<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.720> at<00:02:52.140> all

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
to keep this from moving you know at all

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.949 
to keep this from moving you know at all
but<00:02:52.739> it's<00:02:53.310> pretty<00:02:53.700> sturdy<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.239> way<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.690> as

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
but it's pretty sturdy the way it is as

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.559 
but it's pretty sturdy the way it is as
long<00:02:55.079> as<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.319> don't<00:02:55.579> jockey<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.849> around<00:02:57.209> when

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
long as you don't jockey it around when

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.800 
long as you don't jockey it around when
you're<00:02:57.720> printing<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:59.790> far<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.060> this<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.569> put

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
you're printing and as far as this I put

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
you're printing and as far as this I put
two<00:03:02.180> just<00:03:03.180> two<00:03:03.390> little<00:03:03.599> slaps<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.519> glued

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
two just two little slaps that I glued

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.900 
two just two little slaps that I glued
to<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> bottom<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.079> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:08.190> slide<00:03:08.610> it

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
to the bottom of it so you can slide it

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.509 
to the bottom of it so you can slide it
in<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.209> out<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.930> then<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.349> just<00:03:10.620> put<00:03:10.890> one<00:03:11.130> screw

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
in and out and then I just put one screw

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.970 
in and out and then I just put one screw
down<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.269> just<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.170> hold<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.530> from<00:03:13.680> moving

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
down to it just to hold it from moving

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
down to it just to hold it from moving
when<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.609> get<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> where<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> want<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.630> but<00:03:16.380> yeah

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
when I get it where I want it but yeah

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
when I get it where I want it but yeah
took<00:03:16.829> me<00:03:16.980> about<00:03:17.130> 25<00:03:17.489> minutes<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.030> build<00:03:18.239> and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
took me about 25 minutes to build and

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.110 
took me about 25 minutes to build and
probably<00:03:19.470> less<00:03:19.620> than<00:03:19.769> $25<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:21.769> there<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.889> is

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
probably less than $25 so there it is

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.959 
probably less than $25 so there it is
don't<00:03:24.120> get<00:03:24.269> much<00:03:24.480> easier
