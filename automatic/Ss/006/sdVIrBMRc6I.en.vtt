Cheers no no that is not a thing what if

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.910 
Cheers no no that is not a thing what if
everyone<00:01:35.240> else<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.630> dead<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.440> we're<00:01:36.740> still

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
everyone else is dead and we're still

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.390 
everyone else is dead and we're still
alive

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.680 

that<00:01:40.400> seems<00:01:40.700> even<00:01:40.880> less<00:01:41.150> likely<00:01:41.390> than<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
that seems even less likely than the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.570 
that seems even less likely than the
first<00:01:41.870> one<00:01:42.140> what<00:01:42.290> if<00:01:42.350> everyone's<00:01:42.710> gay<00:01:42.980> and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
first one what if everyone's gay and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.250 
first one what if everyone's gay and
we're<00:01:44.030> still<00:01:44.210> alive<00:01:46.780> that<00:01:47.780> looks<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.990> same<00:01:48.110> to

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
we're still alive that looks the same to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.400 
we're still alive that looks the same to
me

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
me

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.590 
me
that<00:01:48.620> looks<00:01:48.740> no<00:01:48.860> different<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.510> reckon<00:01:50.510> we

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
that looks no different I reckon we

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.510 
that looks no different I reckon we
could<00:01:50.690> be<00:01:50.810> ghosts<00:01:51.200> okay<00:01:51.590> if<00:01:51.650> we<00:01:51.920> are<00:01:52.040> ghosts

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
could be ghosts okay if we are ghosts

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.820 
could be ghosts okay if we are ghosts
then<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:53.300> can<00:01:53.540> walk<00:01:53.810> through<00:01:53.990> stuff<00:01:54.320> right

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
then we can walk through stuff right

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.830 
then we can walk through stuff right
yeah<00:01:55.190> reckon<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.550> could<00:01:55.670> I'll<00:01:56.390> give<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.750> go

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
yeah reckon we could I'll give it a go

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.240 
yeah reckon we could I'll give it a go
right<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.350> won't<00:01:57.710> make<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.830> big<00:01:57.980> fuss<00:01:58.130> about

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
right now I won't make a big fuss about

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.890 
right now I won't make a big fuss about
it<00:01:58.460> though<00:01:58.550> because<00:01:58.700> if<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.240> does<00:01:59.450> work

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
it though because if it does work

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:10.589 
it though because if it does work
don't<00:02:00.260> scare<00:02:00.500> anyone<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:06.710> work

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.149 

now<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> still<00:02:11.379> got<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> lot<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.829> practice<00:02:12.129> with

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
now I still got a lot of practice with

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.410 
now I still got a lot of practice with
the<00:02:12.280> whole<00:02:12.310> walking<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:12.909> walls<00:02:13.120> thing

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
the whole walking for the walls thing

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.759 
the whole walking for the walls thing
like<00:02:13.599> if<00:02:13.689> I<00:02:13.749> give<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> bit<00:02:14.079> more<00:02:14.109> push

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
like if I give it a bit more push
