a surplus when you're bulking what
compounds<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:39.119> looking<00:01:39.420> even<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.869> fatter

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
compounds you're looking even if fatter

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
compounds you're looking even if fatter
than<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:41.070> while<00:01:41.460> trying<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
than what you really are while trying to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.600 
than what you really are while trying to
gain<00:01:42.090> size<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.990> said<00:01:43.229> more<00:01:43.770> stomach

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
gain size is as I said more stomach

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
gain size is as I said more stomach
content<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> consume<00:01:46.290> more<00:01:46.439> food

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
content because you consume more food

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
content because you consume more food
your<00:01:47.040> stomach<00:01:47.430> gets<00:01:47.520> slightly<00:01:47.759> bloated<00:01:48.420> and
