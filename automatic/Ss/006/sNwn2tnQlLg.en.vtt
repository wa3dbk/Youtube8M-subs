just<00:01:32.000> did<00:01:32.210> there<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.539> probably<00:01:32.869> one<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.080> the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.960 
just did there is probably one of the
best<00:01:33.380> parts<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.950> game<00:01:34.100> because<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.819> could

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
best parts of the game because you could

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.059 
best parts of the game because you could
you<00:01:35.659> don't<00:01:35.869> frequently<00:01:36.440> see<00:01:36.709> that<00:01:36.920> in

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
you don't frequently see that in

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.490 
you don't frequently see that in
throwaway<00:01:37.640> demos<00:01:38.030> like<00:01:38.209> these<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:39.140> game<00:01:39.350> was

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500

basically<00:01:39.679> just<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.220> throwaway<00:01:40.490> demo<00:01:40.819> to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
basically just a throwaway demo to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.070 
basically just a throwaway demo to
showcase<00:01:41.979> DirectX<00:01:42.979> for<00:01:43.369> Windows<00:01:43.640> 95<00:01:43.970> cuz<00:01:44.929> of<00:01:45.020> a

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
Dass and still this is pretty good to

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.940 
Dass and still this is pretty good to
have<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.890> version<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.190> a<00:01:52.549> game<00:01:52.880> 3d<00:01:53.720> game<00:01:54.170> almost

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
have a version of a game 3d game almost

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.789 
have a version of a game 3d game almost
like<00:01:55.430> doom<00:01:55.700> running<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:56.539> Windows<00:01:56.689> 95<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.680> was

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
like doom running in Windows 95 that was

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.530 
like doom running in Windows 95 that was
pretty<00:01:58.009> amazing<00:01:58.250> for<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.670> time

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
pretty amazing for the time

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.140 
pretty amazing for the time
now<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.860> about<00:02:02.070> three<00:02:02.400> levels<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.030> this

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
now you get about three levels in this

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.560 
now you get about three levels in this
game<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:04.920> date<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.670> on<00:02:05.820> infinitely<00:02:06.330> they

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
game but date they go on infinitely they

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.390 
game but date they go on infinitely they
just<00:02:06.780> repeat<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.620> choose<00:02:07.830> random

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.400 
just repeat or if you choose random

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.520 
just repeat or if you choose random
though<00:02:08.520> they'll<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.149> random<00:02:12.530> there's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
though they'll go random there's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.470 
though they'll go random there's
basically<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.190> really<00:02:14.520> much<00:02:14.730> many

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
basically not really much many

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
basically not really much many
interesting<00:02:16.020> things<00:02:16.050> about<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.710> game<00:02:16.950> uh

which is coming up right here like right
there<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:40.959> 500<00:02:41.349> miles

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
there see you just go at like 500 miles

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.710 
there see you just go at like 500 miles
an<00:02:42.040> hour<00:02:42.160> max<00:02:42.580> speed<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.120> combine<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.510> with

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
an hour max speed you combine that with

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.330 
an hour max speed you combine that with
the<00:02:43.959> shield<00:02:44.230> power<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.100> basically

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the shield power up and you basically

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.979 
the shield power up and you basically
own<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.450> level<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.850> here<00:02:48.850> we<00:02:48.970> go<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.569> I

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
own the level and here we go I like I

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.670 
own the level and here we go I like I
said<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.890> levels<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.370> repeat<00:02:52.560> except<00:02:53.560> now

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
said the levels just repeat except now

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.960 
said the levels just repeat except now
I'm<00:02:53.800> level<00:02:54.069> 4<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.370> have<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.550> collect<00:02:54.819> more

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
I'm level 4 you have to collect more

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.300 
I'm level 4 you have to collect more
than<00:02:55.030> three<00:02:55.360> flags<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.989> video<00:02:56.739> quality<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
than three flags up video quality of

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.229 
than three flags up video quality of
 but<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.959> got<00:02:59.920> four<00:03:00.430> flags<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.970> collect

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
 but you got four flags to collect

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.220 
 but you got four flags to collect
now<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.959> can't<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.350> see<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.959> most

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
now so you can't really see it the most

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.500 
now so you can't really see it the most
flags<00:03:05.620> you'll<00:03:05.890> have<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.160> collect<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.580> six<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
flags you'll have to collect is six it

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.960 
flags you'll have to collect is six it
goes<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.930> six<00:03:08.200> around<00:03:08.530> level<00:03:09.069> six<00:03:09.489> as<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> matter

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
goes to six around level six as a matter

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.470 
goes to six around level six as a matter
of<00:03:10.090> fact

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.720

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
on a typical computer in 1995 this is

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.270 
on a typical computer in 1995 this is
probably<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.079> quality<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.650> had<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.950> turned<00:04:08.099> up

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
probably the quality I had it turned up

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.770 
probably the quality I had it turned up
all<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.579> way<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:08.730> any<00:04:09.180> computer<00:04:09.630> made

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
all the way because any computer made

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.270 
all the way because any computer made
past<00:04:10.459> 1997<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.519> can<00:04:11.670> handle<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:13.099> this<00:04:14.099> is

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
past 1997 you can handle it and this is

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.080 
past 1997 you can handle it and this is
the<00:04:14.310> blockiness

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the blockiness

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.300 
the blockiness
