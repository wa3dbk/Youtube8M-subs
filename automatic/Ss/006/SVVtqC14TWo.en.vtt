00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello, my friends, I am the winged fairy and today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 I have some super fun activities 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 of tomás and his friends the nice one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.420
 locomotive that lives a lot of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.190
 adventures so what do you think if I 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 you help to do these activities 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.130
 Look, I have three things that we are going to do 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.199
 today on the one hand we have to point out how 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 they are called all parts of the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.359
 locomotive persie 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.429
 on the other hand we have to help tomás 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.669
 to get to the end of this 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.000
 labyrinth and on the other hand we will join the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.860
 points to see who is behind 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.740
 this drawing but good let's start 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.470
 by the principle that is this 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.350
 to see if you know what is called each part 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.800
 of the locomotive persie 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.260
 so to see the light in look here we have 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.540
 all words hook whistle connecting rod 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.890
 cap wheel fireplace roof of the cabin and 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.160
 dome to see this here is very clear 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.160
 this is the fireplace so we put 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 chimney 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:18.100
 fireplace very well 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:20.070
 the 2 in the perfect dome we put 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.290
 computer 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.770

 what is the whistle what the tucu does 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.190
 tucu tucu yo of the train whistle 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.890
 I'm going to cross out the ones we've already 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.020
 put the whistle the chimney and the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.600
 dome and now I'm going to go for the past 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 to see the 8 here that is good 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 the connecting rod 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.079
 and cross out to 7 that are I'm very easy 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.960
 the wheels 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:08.130
 wheel and the rate 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.130
 the 6 is the hook 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:19.700
 very well 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.700
 the 5 where is the top 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.180
 p 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.800
 and we have 1 left which is 4 which is the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.800
 ceiling of the cabin can not be other 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.240
 in fact, we already have it 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.040
 helped percy so he knows how to 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.370
 call all its parts to what has 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.319
 seemed super fun 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.319
 at the same time you are going to see what cool is 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.450
 this is very simple is simply that 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.159
 we have to help tomás to come out 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.739
 of the station so let's do the 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.930
 labyrinth you can put here your 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.590
 name for example my name is I put 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.590

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.720
 to 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.629
 and now let's help tomás 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.849
 he leaves from here chucu chucu chucu a lot 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.250
 much much much out there you can not go 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.590
 because this is one 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.180
 access to the private beach forbidden 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.290
 step to the trains then this more 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.490
 have to go straight cuchi cuchi cuchi 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.660
 here you can not go because there are some 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.660
 little sheep is better to follow 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.150

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.650
 a lot has taken the end to the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.320
