00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.640 

hi<00:00:00.390> guys<00:00:00.840> today's<00:00:01.290> review<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.370> overnight

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
hi guys today's review is the overnight

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.909 
hi guys today's review is the overnight
pads<00:00:04.650> by<00:00:04.920> u<00:00:05.000> by<00:00:06.000> Kotex

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
pads by u by Kotex

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.720 
pads by u by Kotex
anyway<00:00:07.919> open<00:00:08.670> them<00:00:08.820> operating<00:00:10.519> by<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> way

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
anyway open them operating by the way

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.650 
anyway open them operating by the way
the<00:00:11.880> packaging<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:13.559> different<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
the packaging is a bit different to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.599 
the packaging is a bit different to
usual<00:00:17.510> it<00:00:18.510> comes<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.369> drawstrings<00:00:20.369> on

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
usual it comes with the drawstrings on

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
usual it comes with the drawstrings on
the<00:00:20.699> side<00:00:21.199> like<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.279> puff<00:00:24.980> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the side like that so you can puff so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.179 
the side like that so you can puff so
this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> overnight<00:00:28.550> supers<00:00:29.550> orbit<00:00:29.929> pad

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
this is the overnight supers orbit pad

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.360 
this is the overnight supers orbit pad
so<00:00:36.410> check<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.440> out

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
so check that out

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.510 
so check that out
so<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> middle<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:42.410> I<00:00:43.410> guess<00:00:44.190> high<00:00:44.399> up

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so the middle it has a I guess high up

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.830 
so the middle it has a I guess high up
with<00:00:44.670> dolphin<00:00:45.030> see<00:00:45.210> right<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
with dolphin see right because that's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
with dolphin see right because that's
where<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.219> comes<00:00:47.370> from<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
where most of it comes from and you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.240 
where most of it comes from and you
notice<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> side<00:00:49.320> there's<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.489> T<00:00:50.700> leakage

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
notice on this side there's an T leakage

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.990 
notice on this side there's an T leakage
on<00:00:53.250> our<00:00:53.489> walls

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
on our walls

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.779 
on our walls
I<00:00:54.149> guess<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.649> actually<00:00:55.890> goes<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> way

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I guess so it actually goes all the way

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
I guess so it actually goes all the way
around<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> top<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> goes<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> bottom

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
around to the top and goes to the bottom

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.119 
around to the top and goes to the bottom
and<00:01:01.649> interestingly<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:03.170> wall<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.439> extra<00:01:04.979> hot

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and interestingly this wall is extra hot

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.719 
and interestingly this wall is extra hot
so<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.720> sticks<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.729> I'm

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
so that's it sticks out like that I'm

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.070 
so that's it sticks out like that I'm
not<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.090> sure<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:09.930> you're

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
not really sure if you're when you're

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.789 
not really sure if you're when you're
wearing<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:10.979> down<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.770> put<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
wearing it you put it down or you put it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.060 
wearing it you put it down or you put it
back<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:15.380> don't<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:16.830> matters

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
back I don't think it really matters

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.630 
back I don't think it really matters
that<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.049> also<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that much you can also see this the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.320 
that much you can also see this the
approval<00:01:21.090> effort<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.950> anti<00:01:22.950> leakage<00:01:23.400> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
approval effort into anti leakage so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.660 
approval effort into anti leakage so
there's<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> indentations<00:01:25.710> yes<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
there's a lot of indentations yes that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
there's a lot of indentations yes that
will<00:01:26.820> stop<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> blood<00:01:27.650> from<00:01:28.650> flowing<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:29.310> too

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
will stop the blood from flowing out too

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
will stop the blood from flowing out too
much<00:01:30.259> on<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> sides<00:01:33.049> basically<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.740> cool

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
much on to the sides basically so cool

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.810 
much on to the sides basically so cool
tips<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> good<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.520> it's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
tips this is good because I think it's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.069 
tips this is good because I think it's
really<00:01:38.970> important<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.720> having<00:01:39.990> an

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
really important if you're having an

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.980 
really important if you're having an
overnight<00:01:40.380> pad<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:42.750> kind<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
overnight pad to have some kind of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920 
overnight pad to have some kind of
security<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.720> blood

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
security that you're you know your blood

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.859 
security that you're you know your blood
flow<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.229> gonna<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.729> stopped<00:01:47.729> before<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.570> leaks

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
flow is gonna be stopped before it leaks

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.310 
flow is gonna be stopped before it leaks
onto<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.409> bed<00:01:49.790> onto<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> mattress<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.570> no

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
onto your bed onto the mattress and no

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.580 
onto your bed onto the mattress and no
one<00:01:52.500> likes<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> especially<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:55.079> sleepover

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
one likes that especially on a sleepover

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.289 
one likes that especially on a sleepover
that<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.640> embarrassing<00:01:56.729> all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that would be really embarrassing all

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.920 
that would be really embarrassing all
camps<00:01:59.000> so<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.270> you're<00:02:00.390> having<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.689> camp

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
camps so if you're having a camp

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.319 
camps so if you're having a camp
sleepover<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.820> want<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> make<00:02:03.299> sure

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
sleepover you know you want to make sure

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.870 
sleepover you know you want to make sure
nothing<00:02:03.750> leaks<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.189> even<00:02:05.189> onto<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:05.549> own<00:02:05.670> bed

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
nothing leaks out even onto your own bed

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.630 
nothing leaks out even onto your own bed
I<00:02:06.140> recommend<00:02:07.140> these

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
I recommend these

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
I recommend these
they're<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.709> solvent<00:02:11.099> app

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
they're very this thing solvent app

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.839 
they're very this thing solvent app

absorbent<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.650> I'm<00:02:14.859> going<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.129> put<00:02:15.249> this<00:02:15.370> back

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
absorbent and I'm going to put this back

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.020 
absorbent and I'm going to put this back
because<00:02:15.909> I<00:02:16.379> don't<00:02:17.379> need<00:02:17.439> to<00:02:17.620> use<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
because I don't need to use it the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.679 
because I don't need to use it the
minimal<00:02:19.749> packaging<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.319> well<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.849> think

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
minimal packaging as well so I think

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.069 
minimal packaging as well so I think
it's<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.560> good<00:02:23.709> if<00:02:23.829> they<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.840> little

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
it's really good if they have as little

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.599 
it's really good if they have as little
packaging<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:26.739> possible<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.159> hate<00:02:27.430> having

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
packaging as possible I hate having

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.420 
packaging as possible I hate having
those<00:02:27.819> little<00:02:28.200> stripper<00:02:29.200> things<00:02:29.409> you<00:02:30.280> get

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
those little stripper things you get

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.660 
those little stripper things you get
from<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.790> sides<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.450> wings<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:33.489> good

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
from the sides of the wings it's good

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
from the sides of the wings it's good
that<00:02:33.790> they've<00:02:33.969> included<00:02:34.120> everything<00:02:34.659> one<00:02:34.989> so
