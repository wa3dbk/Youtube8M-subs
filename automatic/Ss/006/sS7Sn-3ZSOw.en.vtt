this<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.840> from<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.530> era<00:02:45.830> when<00:02:46.069> gains<00:02:46.340> just

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
this is from that era when gains just

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.470 
this is from that era when gains just
punished<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> question<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.549> if<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.180> game

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
