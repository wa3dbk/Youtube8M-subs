00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
them they need to roll that on because

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.950 
them they need to roll that on because
he<00:02:02.240> also<00:02:02.420> takes<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.110> stump<00:02:03.530> out<00:02:03.740> there<00:02:04.960> so

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
he also takes the stump out there so

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.990

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
he's either out the stunt as he walks

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.170 
he's either out the stunt as he walks
out<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.320> keeper<00:02:09.560> very<00:02:10.100> aware<00:02:10.460> realizing

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
out but the keeper very aware realizing

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.940 
out but the keeper very aware realizing
that<00:02:11.240> he<00:02:11.360> might<00:02:11.570> have<00:02:11.690> been<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.020> takes<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that he might have been in takes the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.730 
that he might have been in takes the
stump<00:02:13.220> out<00:02:13.400> as<00:02:13.610> well<00:02:13.850> with<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.150> ball<00:02:14.740> so

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
stump out as well with the ball so
