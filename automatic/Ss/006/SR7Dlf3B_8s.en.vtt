last<00:03:12.750> minute<00:03:13.170> which<00:03:13.290> was<00:03:13.500> ridiculous<00:03:14.310> anyway

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
last minute which was ridiculous anyway

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.750

Blackpool I think I'll be the first game

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.490 
Blackpool I think I'll be the first game
of<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.859> next<00:03:35.130> step<00:03:35.250> aside<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.319> it's<00:03:37.319> well

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
of the next step aside and it's well

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.229 
of the next step aside and it's well
worth<00:03:37.739> watching<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.400> course<00:03:38.430> tune<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.120> for

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
worth watching of course tune in for

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.420 
worth watching of course tune in for
that<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:39.959> yeah<00:03:40.079> ballon<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.739> inspired

eighties<00:03:56.010> if<00:03:56.160> i<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.459> remember<00:03:56.670> rightly<00:03:57.030> i

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
eighties if i can remember rightly i

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.990 
eighties if i can remember rightly i
think<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.049> might<00:03:58.139> be<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.380> 83<00:03:58.950> but<00:03:59.459> also<00:03:59.609> what<00:03:59.970> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
think it might be in 83 but also what I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.099 
think it might be in 83 but also what I
noticed<00:04:00.359> about<00:04:00.420> him<00:04:00.569> is<00:04:00.870> he<00:04:00.930> has<00:04:01.049> great

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
noticed about him is he has great

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.589 
noticed about him is he has great
physical<00:04:01.980> attributes<00:04:02.609> that<00:04:02.880> are<00:04:03.299> really

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
physical attributes that are really

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.000 
physical attributes that are really
going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.810> benefit<00:04:04.260> us<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> center<00:04:04.859> of<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
going to benefit us in the center of the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.160 
going to benefit us in the center of the
park<00:04:05.370> he's<00:04:05.880> quick<00:04:06.239> as<00:04:06.450> well<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:06.989> how

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
park he's quick as well and that's how

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.780 
park he's quick as well and that's how
he<00:04:07.200> latched<00:04:07.500> onto<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.889> pass<00:04:08.160> earlier<00:04:08.639> in

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
he latched onto that pass earlier in

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.659 
he latched onto that pass earlier in
this<00:04:08.880> game<00:04:09.079> with<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.260> speed<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.829> his<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.579> I

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
this game with that speed of his and I

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.099 
this game with that speed of his and I
really<00:04:11.970> think<00:04:12.090> he's<00:04:12.299> going<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.599> good<00:04:12.870> he's

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
really think he's going to be good he's

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.710 
really think he's going to be good he's
a<00:04:13.139> better<00:04:13.440> plan<00:04:13.739> Alan<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.549> don't<00:04:14.790> wanna<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.180> say

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
a better plan Alan I don't wanna I say

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.000 
a better plan Alan I don't wanna I say
that<00:04:15.870> too<00:04:16.049> loud<00:04:16.320> because<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.739> might<00:04:16.889> get

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
that too loud because I might get

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.860 
that too loud because I might get
crucified<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:18.329> he's<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.479> better<00:04:18.690> player

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
crucified I think he's a better player

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.759 
crucified I think he's a better player
than<00:04:18.959> Alan

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
than Alan

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.039 
than Alan

game<00:04:31.590> live<00:04:31.860> at<00:04:32.129> some<00:04:32.310> point<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.759> but<00:04:33.659> here<00:04:33.840> we

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
game live at some point and but here we

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.260 
game live at some point and but here we
go<00:04:34.080> we're<00:04:34.319> having<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.250> really<00:04:35.460> similar<00:04:35.789> record

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
go we're having a really similar record

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.999 
go we're having a really similar record
with<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.479> penalties<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.379> somehow<00:04:37.830> that

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
with the penalties and somehow that

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.119 
with the penalties and somehow that
Shelby<00:04:38.610> pen<00:04:38.819> went<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.080> think<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:41.069> was

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
Shelby pen went in and I think it was

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.439 
Shelby pen went in and I think it was
just<00:04:41.310> really<00:04:41.520> well<00:04:41.759> hit<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:43.560> think<00:04:44.060> act<00:04:45.060> pan

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
just really well hit and I think act pan

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.879 
just really well hit and I think act pan
