00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.410
 impossible to imagine aviation without 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.840
 helicopters their ability to produce 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.820
 vertical takeoffs and landings motionless 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.620
 hang in the air and even move in 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.300
 any direction makes this look 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.370
 aircraft truly 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.350
 indispensable helicopter does not need 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
 the airfield it can take off and land in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.339
 hard to reach places in any locality 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.960
 and in some cases can produce 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.540
 loading and unloading people and goods without 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.120
 planting including under abnormal conditions 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.800
 low or high temperatures exist 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.930
 many modifications of this type of technology 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.899
 but most popular russia 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.429
 enjoys a helicopter no 8 mi-8 helicopter 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.140
 one of the most massive in history is not 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:13.220
 only Soviet but also world aviation 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.810
 its high maintenance 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.940
 characteristics allowed to use 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.420
 its both civil and military 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.850
 service 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.250
 in his more than half a century career he 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.899
 rightfully earned the respect of the pilots 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.759
 mi 8 to the military airfield north 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.190
 Received two years ago 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.259
 the pilots say that this helicopter alone 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.360
 of the most successful configurations on 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.740
 speeds up to two hundred and fifty 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.210
 kilometers per hour it can climb 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.909
 5 kilometers above the ground 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.189
 despite the fact that such a device weighs only 12 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.579
 t easy to maintain a simple 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.860
 managing reliable combat missions 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.490
 mi-8 us helicopter 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.770
 multipurpose transport performs 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.299
 tasks such as transport 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.189
 transportation of only paratroopers 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.409
 cargo of all kinds also 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.900
 bulky cargo like inside saloon 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.910
 so on the external suspension 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.800
 this helicopter in combat engagement 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.080
 did not accept now it is used 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.300
 exclusively for peaceful purposes but how 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 only need it can turn 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.200
 formidable weapon 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:24.860
 fighting bledans will just turn out 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 beamed holder holder and we took off 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.190
 hours are not needed and even here the weapons 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.330
 crew of mi-8 regularly spend 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.100
 training flights modifying 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.990
 piloting technique which has 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.690
 a variety of features support 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.580
 high level of training is necessary in 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.260
 driving heavy military aircraft and 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.440
 by helicopter there is a significant difference 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.959
 Huge expressed well firstly I do not know 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.970
 how do we dive by helicopter much 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.250
 harder to fly a helicopter I think that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.209
 this plane degree of freedom helicopters 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.050
 much more we have it 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.600
 work with all your hands and feet 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.020
 head turning left and right 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.120
 painful shavings cyclical wait gas 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.590
 it's all interconnected and not 8 pretty 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.200
 it's hard to replace it with an upgrade 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.090
 happens constantly over the past 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.670
 fifty years for the needs of the defense ministry was 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.400
 manufactured over 30 different 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.620
 modifications 2020 year the number of new 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.390
 mi-8 in the Russian air force 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.400
 planned to increase to 400 units 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.400
 against the current 50 cars 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.409
 pilots call their work lifestyle 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.659
 they feel the sky under their feet and look 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.480
 on life is a highly literal sense of it 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:04:01.069
 the words here are more for me than freedom 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:02.860
 even when you feel something in the sky smiling 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.100
 I do not know 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.530
 human huge which 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.850
 two saws 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.850
 can fly like birds
