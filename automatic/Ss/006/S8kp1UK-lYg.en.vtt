in half or can you bring up the
so-and-so<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.280> those<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> kinds<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so-and-so or those are the kinds of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.680 
so-and-so or those are the kinds of
changes<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.530> most<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> time<00:00:56.600> there<00:00:57.600> are

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
changes I get most of the time there are

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
changes I get most of the time there are
actually<00:00:57.989> improvements<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> piece<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
actually improvements to the piece of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.510 
actually improvements to the piece of
music<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:01.590> never<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.219> been<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
music so I have never really been in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
music so I have never really been in
that<00:01:02.699> situation<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.140> is

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that situation and I think this is

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.120 
that situation and I think this is
actually<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.330> bonus<00:01:07.070> or<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
actually a little bit of a bonus or a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
actually a little bit of a bonus or a
little<00:01:08.490> bit<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> an<00:01:08.790> advantage<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.479> doing

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
little bit of an advantage of doing

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.609 
little bit of an advantage of doing
library<00:01:10.140> music<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.710> general<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.619> fewer

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
library music in general there are fewer

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
library music in general there are fewer
people<00:01:14.420> your<00:01:15.420> producers<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.560> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.070> all

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
people your producers that need to all

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
people your producers that need to all
you<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.729> give<00:01:18.030> their<00:01:18.270> opinion<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.530> a

you know give their opinion and as a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.560 
you know give their opinion and as a
result<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.549> tends<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:22.009> fairly<00:01:23.009> easy<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
result it tends to be fairly easy if you

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
music is a lot better than if you were

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.020 
music is a lot better than if you were
to<00:02:26.409> have<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.799> another<00:02:27.040> crow<00:02:27.280> underscore

composer<00:02:28.359> because<00:02:28.719> you<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.200> usually<00:02:29.439> have<00:02:30.430> to

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
composer because you you usually have to

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.089

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
work ethic you know is it feasible for

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240 
work ethic you know is it feasible for
them<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.659> crank<00:02:43.989> out<00:02:44.139> a<00:02:44.200> few<00:02:44.470> pieces<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.919> week

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
them to crank out a few pieces a week

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.500 
them to crank out a few pieces a week
that<00:02:45.760> they<00:02:46.299> could<00:02:46.480> pitch<00:02:46.689> it<00:02:46.840> libraries<00:02:47.590> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
that they could pitch it libraries and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.119 
that they could pitch it libraries and
hope<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.989> know<00:02:50.109> in<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.349> first<00:02:50.620> year

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
hope that you know in the first year

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.940 
hope that you know in the first year
maybe<00:02:51.459> they<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:52.030> ten<00:02:52.900> tracks<00:02:53.200> picked<00:02:53.560> up<00:02:53.739> and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
maybe they get ten tracks picked up and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.759 
maybe they get ten tracks picked up and
then<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.250> next<00:02:54.549> year<00:02:54.669> they<00:02:54.909> get<00:02:55.060> 20<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.709> a

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
then the next year they get 20 I have a

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.309 
then the next year they get 20 I have a
theory<00:02:57.189> that<00:02:57.219> people<00:02:57.609> can<00:02:58.120> pretty<00:02:58.540> quickly<00:02:58.959> in

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
theory that people can pretty quickly in

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.720 
theory that people can pretty quickly in
a<00:02:59.379> matter<00:02:59.409> of<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.769> couple<00:02:59.799> of<00:03:00.129> years<00:03:00.250> build<00:03:00.579> up

mind<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.759> think<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.090> first<00:03:43.720> most<00:03:44.409> important

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
mind I think the first most important

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.009 
mind I think the first most important
thing<00:03:45.159> is<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:46.269> something<00:03:46.659> that<00:03:46.810> I've<00:03:46.989> learned

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
thing is to something that I've learned

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.409 
thing is to something that I've learned
being<00:03:47.769> on<00:03:47.979> both<00:03:48.220> sides<00:03:48.549> of<00:03:48.790> this<00:03:48.939> of<00:03:49.180> this

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
being on both sides of this of this

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.050 
being on both sides of this of this
situation<00:03:50.109> is<00:03:50.650> when<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.639> a<00:03:51.669> full-time

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
situation is when you are a full-time

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.149 
situation is when you are a full-time
you<00:03:52.599> don't<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.139> when<00:03:53.319> you're<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.500> part-time

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
you don't know when you're a part-time

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.360 
you don't know when you're a part-time
musician<00:03:54.449> you<00:03:55.449> have<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.780> lot<00:03:56.169> harder<00:03:56.530> to

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
musician you have a lot harder to

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.399 
musician you have a lot harder to
compete<00:03:57.759> with<00:03:57.970> full-time<00:03:58.449> musicians<00:03:59.019> because

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
compete with full-time musicians because

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.140 
compete with full-time musicians because
the<00:03:59.709> full-time<00:04:00.099> musicians<00:04:00.519> are<00:04:00.669> only<00:04:00.790> doing

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
the full-time musicians are only doing

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.770 
the full-time musicians are only doing
music<00:04:01.569> so<00:04:02.139> you<00:04:02.799> know<00:04:02.979> I<00:04:03.009> can<00:04:03.519> tell<00:04:03.790> you<00:04:04.000> when<00:04:04.750> I

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
music so you know I can tell you when I

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.170 
music so you know I can tell you when I
went<00:04:05.620> full-time<00:04:05.979> I<00:04:06.250> mean<00:04:06.549> my<00:04:06.759> productivity

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
went full-time I mean my productivity

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360 
went full-time I mean my productivity
just<00:04:07.750> went<00:04:08.049> through<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.500> roof<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:08.979> it's<00:04:09.159> not

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
just went through the roof and it's not

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.969 
just went through the roof and it's not
just<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.729> I<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:10.060> produce<00:04:10.379> more<00:04:11.379> pieces<00:04:11.859> of

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
just that I can produce more pieces of

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.670 
just that I can produce more pieces of
music<00:04:12.129> because<00:04:12.549> because<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.090> have<00:04:13.540> more<00:04:14.319> time

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
music because because I have more time

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.089 
music because because I have more time
but<00:04:15.129> also<00:04:15.370> because<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:16.479> write<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.739> many<00:04:17.859> more

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
but also because I write so many more

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.979 
but also because I write so many more
pieces<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.579> music<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.940> get<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> lot<00:04:19.329> better<00:04:19.539> at<00:04:19.690> it

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
pieces of music I get a lot better at it

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.000 
pieces of music I get a lot better at it
and<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.799> I've<00:04:20.950> got<00:04:21.099> a<00:04:21.130> lot<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.370> fast

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
and so I've got a lot of fast

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.270 
and so I've got a lot of fast
and<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.700> now<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.510> write<00:04:23.810> pieces<00:04:24.470> of<00:04:24.620> music<00:04:25.100> a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
and so now I can write pieces of music a

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.450 
and so now I can write pieces of music a
lot<00:04:25.760> quicker<00:04:26.180> than<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.630> could<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.890> know<00:04:28.040> six

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
lot quicker than I could you know six

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.260 
lot quicker than I could you know six
seven<00:04:28.820> years<00:04:29.000> ago<00:04:29.150> when<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.230> would<00:04:30.410> take<00:04:30.740> me

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
seven years ago when it would take me

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.360 
seven years ago when it would take me
you<00:04:32.270> know<00:04:32.450> a<00:04:32.630> week<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.530> come<00:04:33.770> up<00:04:33.920> with<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.100> decent

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
you know a week to come up with a decent

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.620 
you know a week to come up with a decent
piece<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:35.090> music<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:36.640> now<00:04:37.640> it's<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.450> know<00:04:38.600> I

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
piece of music and now it's you know I

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.780 
piece of music and now it's you know I
can<00:04:39.110> maybe<00:04:39.350> do<00:04:39.590> one<00:04:39.800> in<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:40.040> day<00:04:40.220> or<00:04:40.520> something

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
can maybe do one in a day or something

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.580 
can maybe do one in a day or something
like<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.150> depending<00:04:41.690> on<00:04:41.960> how<00:04:42.020> complicated

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
like that depending on how complicated

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.420 
like that depending on how complicated
it<00:04:43.040> is<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:43.400> it's<00:04:43.910> important<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.690> realize<00:04:45.170> that

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
it is so it's important to realize that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.210 
it is so it's important to realize that
you<00:04:46.430> should<00:04:46.700> write<00:04:47.350> whenever<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.860> can

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
you should write whenever you can

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.190 
you should write whenever you can
because<00:04:49.550> not<00:04:50.270> only<00:04:50.300> are<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.780> gonna<00:04:50.930> have<00:04:51.170> a

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
because not only are you gonna have a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.510 
because not only are you gonna have a
larger<00:04:51.650> output<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.100> you've<00:04:52.280> got<00:04:52.400> actually

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
larger output but you've got actually

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.160 
larger output but you've got actually
going<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:52.880> get<00:04:53.000> better<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.600> that's<00:04:53.840> gonna

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
going to get better and that's gonna

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.320 
going to get better and that's gonna
make<00:04:54.350> your<00:04:54.590> output<00:04:54.980> even<00:04:55.220> bigger<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.030> it's

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
make your output even bigger so it's

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.360 
make your output even bigger so it's
important<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.020> write<00:04:57.320> whenever<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.830> can<00:04:58.070> and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
important to write whenever you can and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.630 
important to write whenever you can and
then<00:04:58.490> the<00:04:58.610> next<00:04:58.940> thing<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.420> I<00:05:00.140> think<00:05:00.740> what<00:05:01.490> you

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
then the next thing is I think what you

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.710 
then the next thing is I think what you
learn<00:05:02.030> quickly<00:05:02.990> is<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:04.730> learn<00:05:05.150> how<00:05:05.690> to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
learn quickly is that you learn how to

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.960 
learn quickly is that you learn how to
write<00:05:06.200> this<00:05:06.380> type<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.650> music<00:05:06.920> you<00:05:07.190> learn<00:05:07.550> how

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
write this type of music you learn how

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.960 
write this type of music you learn how
what<00:05:08.420> works<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.560> won't<00:05:09.890> have<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.430> write<00:05:10.670> a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
what works and you won't have to write a

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.150 
what works and you won't have to write a
hundred<00:05:11.390> pieces<00:05:11.930> for<00:05:12.110> music<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.590> get<00:05:12.770> ten

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160
