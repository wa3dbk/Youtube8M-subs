00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.940
 spinosaurus aquatic the spinosaurus is 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 the first dinosaur that is known capable 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.410
 to live both on land and in the water 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.420
 all thanks to the discovery of new 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 fossils in morocco by a team 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 International paleontologists 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.650
 result described in the journal science 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.869
 it can not be more surprising to work 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 with this animal has been like studying a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.730
 alien arrived from space is not 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.369
 it looks like no other dinosaur there 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.929
 seen they say hoist paleontologist brain of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 the University of Chicago and author 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.910
 the study's main species measures 15 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 meters long what makes it 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 one of the predatory dinosaurs of 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.300
 greater scope that they wandered through 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 our planet your body shows a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.530
 series of aquatic adaptations ever 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.829
 seen in another dinosaur that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 they allowed to spend a lot of time in the water 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.579
 making it a good swimmer as well 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 allowed him to feed on sharks 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 sawfish and fish lung two 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 even the history of its fossils is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 complex the first evidence of a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.070
 spinosaurus was discovered more than 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.960
 a century by the German paleontologist 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 james frey strummer 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 Egyptian Sahara desert but for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 Unfortunately the fossils were destroyed 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.670
 in 1944 during the 2nd World War II 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.130
 in a bombing ally in the world to the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.960
 minus the notes photos and notes of 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.600
 strummer survived the new 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
 fossils a much more complete set 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 which includes parts of a skull the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 axial column the pelvis and the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.180
 limbs were recovered by a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.950
 local fossil hunter in the region of 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 ken that in the Moroccan Sahara in a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 area that was once a long river and the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 researchers used the remains 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
 to recreate a digital model of a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.170
 adult specimen and compare it with other 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.450
 similar species so they realized 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.149
 of its extraordinary adaptations 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 aquatic the dinosaur could retract its 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.800
 fleshy noses to a position in the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.869
 top of his head and he used 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.000
 your flat feet to propel yourself to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.280
 through the pelvic gut glide and the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.500
 hind limbs were also 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.210
 smaller than those of other species 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.340
 related and the center of gravity 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 seemed to have moved towards the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.780
 backside to facilitate swimming 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.740
 the neck the spine and the tail 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.260
 of the creature 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.360
 they were adapted to pursue prey 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.520
 under the water on its back a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.710
 candle probably covered with skin 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.810
 kept visible when the animal was 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.970
 in the water this body of swimmer without 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.100
 But forced to walk to four 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.100
 legs when moving on land
