so<00:01:22.850> there<00:01:23.090> are<00:01:23.149> three<00:01:23.329> ways<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.689> can<00:01:23.840> go<00:01:24.020> by

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
pinner hair it's a great idea to use a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.580

because it really comes out the bun and
gives<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.630> great<00:01:32.750> bit<00:01:32.960> of<00:01:33.049> volume<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:33.890> if

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
gives it a great bit of volume but if

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.770
