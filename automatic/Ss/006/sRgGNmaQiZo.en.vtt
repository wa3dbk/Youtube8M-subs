that he does that okay so the fourth

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.030 
that he does that okay so the fourth
reason<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.630> power<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.170> tread<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.500> serpents

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
reason is the power to tread on serpents

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400

scorpions are they're on the ground

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.190 
scorpions are they're on the ground
right<00:03:14.100> where<00:03:14.790> we<00:03:15.060> live<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.480> true<00:03:15.780> through<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
right where we live and true through a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.230 
right where we live and true through a
metaphor<00:03:16.800> for<00:03:17.070> witchcraft<00:03:17.370> through<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
metaphor for demonic attack and that's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.160 
metaphor for demonic attack and that's
why<00:03:20.580> we<00:03:20.760> know<00:03:20.940> we<00:03:21.150> are<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.300> command<00:03:21.600> demons<00:03:22.050> to

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
why we know we are to command demons to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.449 
why we know we are to command demons to
come<00:03:22.380> out<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> people<00:03:22.980> we<00:03:23.100> were<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.280> take

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
are to remove that when they attack

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.320 
are to remove that when they attack
individual<00:03:28.170> people<00:03:28.800> but<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:29.670> are<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.209> go

into the heavens to do that so the final

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.500 
into the heavens to do that so the final
one<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.660> we<00:03:34.110> are<00:03:34.230> commanded<00:03:34.530> not<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:35.130> judge
