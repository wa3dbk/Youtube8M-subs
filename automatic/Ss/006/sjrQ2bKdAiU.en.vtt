I<00:00:55.000> think<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.870> attendance<00:00:56.200> is<00:00:56.260> supposed<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.500> be

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
I think the attendance is supposed to be

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.980 
I think the attendance is supposed to be
around<00:00:56.650> 40,000<00:00:57.430> or<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:57.760> that's<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.810> lot<00:00:58.960> of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
around 40,000 or so that's a lot of

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.420 
around 40,000 or so that's a lot of
people<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.350> obviously<00:00:59.860> most<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.130> those<00:01:00.250> are

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
people and obviously most of those are

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.740 
people and obviously most of those are
going<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.700> be<00:01:00.760> strangers<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.300> it's<00:01:01.420> always

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.540 
going to be strangers so it's always
