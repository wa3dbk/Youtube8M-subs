00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:04.490
 welcome and god when you watch this video 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.909
 at the movie and the referee could what you get a psp that no longer works 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.009
 often a psp lack of this can be corrected 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.039
 I also play the sp for a short while I will show you look at the green light 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.140
 is burning 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.589
 and nothing much happens at all 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.659
 yes that is the location there 5 million tons can usually play in games 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.659
 with you with your psp 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.449
 so of course not 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.449
 the case how can that be oh yes say well it is actually very simple 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.069
 I already have trouble using a Pandora battery 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.880
 and foggy in messina 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.730
 but you may wonder how colombia and the palpable data come later 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.170
 back 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.630
 I am now going to show you the purpose of this 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.910
 andorra bakeries and no longer see and make the psp play year until we deliver 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.360
 look very country has assumed he himself psp became nac doing nice 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.230
 self 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.210
 I can therefore imagine the original what the PSP but threaten once and the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.880
 we do that and I knew it 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.150
 in here 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.230
 as the idea 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 the more llink I want to have pressed gold three times 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm through at the same time we do that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.680
 anyway 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.550
 Lorenzo that 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.480
 what should do the works become who is not good at 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.390
 the viewer 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.350
 the light comes on 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.509
 yes look and we have a screen 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.799
 that is just the first option fleshing stood christians vermeer f5 point 5 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 which we confirm after this cabinet takes a while 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.940
 for the competition areas it was mainly about running 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.439
 both broadcasters are cleaning the psp more expensive than just again 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.649
 and the motto apart from this way is to use this method in the city 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.490
 custom much more or what is put on your psp that is not standard fmf of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.350
 sony 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.260
 but this is really one 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.530
 and other far with this movie back herisemmill back ups of your own 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.470
 games that time so just play on your psp and what what what abeln cancel 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.510
 you can just go to the red cross that will stop your psp 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.540
 and then you can just have copies of games there 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.540
 it is also a yellow card, maybe I will be ten games after 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.730
 search team game 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.430
 and how about that you never have to drag those games with you again 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.680
 vacation goes on May even though a game is just directly on your psp 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.019
 and there are actually a few other nice features that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.409
 can continue you can for example set up psp troops 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.089
 watch videos with your example and youtube 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:45.370
 And yes, there are a lot of others and possibilities that could do them 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.150
 right away 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.299
 converted PSP but the fact that the most important for build-up is the PSP 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.379
 actually 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.409
 that you just nice yes all the cymbals for you all your games just nice 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.439
 can play 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.289
 now it is almost full, it is now at 95 percent 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.679
 Jeffrey seem discovered number so 2 the course 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.929
 the essence site can choose the three fine ok so you then 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.929
 but we opt for the euribor 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 what is life itself rebooting 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.030
 almost that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.490
 He will immediately receive our good Kirilenko sofie institution once in a while 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.840
 open again netherlands put it is not all that important 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.679
 the new center 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:41.149
 heidi klum women offender memory stick the more women to 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.559
 it is confirmed with this 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.369
 and so all the while with 5 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.369
 why the petrus also click on the target after that 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.479
 Once have the ability to install the oyo 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:00.529
 now we can take another course 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:02.319
 the plastic bells flask 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.719
 at sparta I say but not the windows are the tukker 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.129
 x quietly continue in the stolk 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.400
 in the streets again press I send start custom on 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.079
 in the busy neighborhood 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.259
 with board back 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.150
 and we look there we go now 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.150
 the Tibetans on September 16 system settings 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:33.550
 verbeeck daily mail at the bottom of the system in a formal sense so that is then as far as five 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.659
 point 5 0 Rome Paris 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.039
 so your psp is now partly doing software through the operating system 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.720
 insists that is that is so 5 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.150
 point 50 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.419
 although the ps 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.990
 So that means that you can already play Dekkers on your PSP 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 twelve just the five were ago I'm now the movie is now four young people Friday 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.030
 busy 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.749
 a few months ago that japan was not a player 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:58.319
 so within five minutes 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.749
 do you have psp of the world 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:04.479
 and I also have the many milky way also many options on your psp 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.230
 well then you start wondering if banks 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.540
 but also to display each other without other devices radio program opportunity to work with 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.900
 but I knew 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.240
 Well then you must view our website that is a clear description 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.849
 zoom 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.360
 that's what we can do with that memory stick 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.430
 And there is also a nice workshop where you can also get a ticket 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.469
 and buy on other batteries 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.029
 but again I don't have to buy it so also a clear description 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.430
 making it a bit harder 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.770
 take a look at our website 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.999
 that is good food 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.819
 substantiating your point yourself 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.539
 And I also don't want to say effect now that this is all classic 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.799
 Only works for the old PSP that is the PSP fat 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.789
 and the slightly new PSP that is the counter special inbev while the PSP 2000 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.550
 and then you have to look and the data code 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.770
 and that the candidates come so that only applies to the psp smart or the psp 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.050
 2000 and that date to which you will find the bags here I will show this 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.379
 poldering 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:12.380
 that's stef look at your data code 6 the critics year 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.860
 also a bit bad but because of this they caught buying there 6 8 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:18.139
 this principle 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.119
 I have your seat fit on all PSP flats 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:25.679
 and all psp slims where the psp slim you have to look and we get there 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:28.679
 may not be higher 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.409
 this the code 6 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.919
 six is ​​lower than lease land the start with the sowing firm letter 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.919
 so this will be fully built up what is the coming time 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.909
 so way valdes if you have the smart version 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:44.749
 look good deeds can be 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.669
 though the last points don't make sense to you 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.349
 though look well I hope that you already let what you fake and this tutorial 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.699
