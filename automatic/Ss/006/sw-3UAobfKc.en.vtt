00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
enough protein because protein turns out

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.330 
enough protein because protein turns out

has so trying to lose weight vegetables
and<00:04:11.110> lean<00:04:11.320> protein<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.190> really<00:04:12.670> going<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.970> do

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
and lean protein is really going to do

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.840 
and lean protein is really going to do
the<00:04:13.270> trick<00:04:13.510> for<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.740> that's<00:04:14.980> often<00:04:15.370> times
