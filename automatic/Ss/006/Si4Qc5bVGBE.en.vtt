00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
see it because it runs so clear and then

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.809 
see it because it runs so clear and then
you<00:01:47.060> can<00:01:47.209> always<00:01:47.389> cover<00:01:47.569> it<00:01:47.749> up<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:47.840> anything

just slip this in and then make sure the
edges<00:02:30.790> line<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.680> against<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.970> edges<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:35.620> we

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
edges line up against the edges there we

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.870 
edges line up against the edges there we
go<00:02:40.200> then<00:02:41.200> once<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.890> if<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.549> close<00:02:42.849> it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
go then once that's in if you close it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.970 
go then once that's in if you close it
it'll<00:02:43.750> look<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.410> front<00:02:44.620> and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
it'll look like this on the front and

it'll look like this on the front and
this<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> back<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.510> then<00:02:47.260> even<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.709> sides

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
this on the back and then even the sides

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.789 
this on the back and then even the sides
filled<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.459> okay<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:49.269> now<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.319> next<00:02:50.349> thing<00:02:50.620> we

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
filled in okay so now the next thing we

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.680 
filled in okay so now the next thing we
did<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.489> next<00:02:52.030> thing<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.569> is

did you do it next thing going to do is
get<00:02:52.840> patients<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.610> our<00:02:54.730> pages<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.780> any

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
get patients so our pages can be any

your<00:03:22.329> page<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.780> folded<00:03:23.400> then<00:03:24.400> we'll<00:03:24.579> be<00:03:24.700> gluing

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
your page is folded then we'll be gluing

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.000 
your page is folded then we'll be gluing
them<00:03:25.150> together<00:03:25.329> you'll<00:03:26.109> have<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.470> first<00:03:26.769> one

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
them together you'll have the first one

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.210 
them together you'll have the first one
going<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.459> like<00:03:27.519> this<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.870> other<00:03:28.900> one

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.370 

going<00:03:33.220> down<00:03:33.670> like<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.359> and<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.350> other

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
going down like this and then the other

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.620 
going down like this and then the other
one<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.950> up<00:03:36.040> like<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.489> so<00:03:37.269> none<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.480> the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
one going up like this so none of the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.910 
one going up like this so none of the
white<00:03:37.780> will<00:03:37.959> show<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:38.380> if<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.590> don't<00:03:38.709> use<00:03:38.889> a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
white will show so if you don't use a

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.410 
white will show so if you don't use a
double-sided<00:03:39.400> piece<00:03:39.609> of<00:03:39.790> paper<00:03:39.940> that's<00:03:40.150> fine

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
double-sided piece of paper that's fine

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.400 
double-sided piece of paper that's fine
so<00:03:41.139> we'll<00:03:41.350> start<00:03:41.440> adhering<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:42.280> together

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
so we'll start adhering this together

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:54.180 
so we'll start adhering this together
just<00:03:44.410> take<00:03:44.620> one<00:03:44.859> side

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.770 

and<00:03:55.190> then<00:03:55.819> take<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.180> other<00:03:56.330> side<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:59.599> can

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
and then take the other side you can

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.809 
and then take the other side you can
make<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> bigger<00:04:00.290> book<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.159> want<00:04:01.459> with<00:04:01.580> more

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
pages by just doing this same method

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.130
