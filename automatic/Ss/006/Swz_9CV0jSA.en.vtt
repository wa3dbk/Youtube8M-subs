00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.000
 It is Subaru Nagano of Hello Sagamihara Pakurenzu income 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 The ball introduced this time was newly released from the Roto grip 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.920
 I would like to introduce the prison cell 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.070
 We go first towards the layered 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:22.090
 Pin to pap 5 inches 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:28.770
 Because here asymmetric cheap nest bus if trout s 4 1/2 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.770
 The pin buffer is set to 4 and 5/8 pin round 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:41.059
 I would like to give it as a comparison ball large parcel ball yes yes 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:44.990
 Pp 4 1/2 Masu is the better of the voice is 41 I pin buffer layout from the pin 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.450
 Is set to 3 inches 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.070
 This time yeah 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.540
 Cell series latest work prison cell cover snaps micro snap 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.240
 Solit of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.970
 It is a cover 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:04.420
 The surface finish is 1500 polish 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.800
 Series to it is very recently I often use the micro-snap cover 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.710
 But 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:17.330
 It was said that the cover stock of pearl material pearl system was often installed if it said rather 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:23.210
 I think by mounting the micro snap solid cover this time 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:26.440
 The cell series has a very good balance with the common nuclear score today 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:31.090
 I think it might be 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:34.860
 Mike 's snap cover is very good 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 I feel the catch friction is strong 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.810
 And yet, it's solid, so it's very oil resistant 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:49.799
 I received an image of not losing 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.900
 But the front is not wasted catch sense since it has surface becomes No. 1500 polish 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:58.870
 I think it is a smooth image 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.740
 Speaking of Prince Nucleus has become a ball that feels very high appearance rising strongly 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.670
 not to mention 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.840
 Series of images which go by pocket rather 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:11.250
 I think it is better, but in terms of this solid pearl and solid polish 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:25.620
 I think that I feel the goodness of its nuclear score very much 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:31.350
 Skid to here hyper of previous work again but I know of 73 mha Pearl 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.710
 In the Well and catch the ball skit sense of feel strongly that rather 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.710
 I feel but it is good 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:42.050
 I think which is the ball with a medium center at this time is polished finish 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:46.660
 Because it is micro snap 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:52.480
 I think that it is very usable with medium to medium oily 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:59.860
 I think which series I can say which one is more likely to be an image that bends 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:04.210
 We have micro- snap strong cover this time, but there are a lot of oil if it is the 1500th 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.650
 If you use it under such conditions, it is No. 4000 here 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:12.980
 Country by lathe 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:18.650
 If it is possible to et I think fairly can be used in oil often condition 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:24.439
 So far the most powerful of the first hypers of this hyper lets you 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.670
 It was a ball that bends easily but this is also close by frosting the surface 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:31.380
 In some cases of it the back-end is the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.140
 As action is finished in ball which this one comes out more strongly , it is considerable 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.360
 I think that the potty high presentational ball I thought 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.840
 It's a series that I can really hear 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.580
 It has become a popular product 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:53.310
 Well this time it will be new again with the combination of the new micro snap solid 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:57.180
 I think it will be added to the image of the series, so by all means 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.350
 If you are looking for a ball for that oil then this is 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.770
 I want to buy a prison cell 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.770
 I will try to throw it from now 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.890
