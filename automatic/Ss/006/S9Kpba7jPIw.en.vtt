 the iPhone as well as said it would not have but unfortunately about SAS SAS 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.989
 you as you see buy the iron 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.769
 and what you do to Sat 1 Schreinemakers spread his duties 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.279
 us he always got in touch with me he would have pulled the west to it though 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.159
 to pretend 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.949
 at the same time the best 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.249
 the ones I already know are actually alarm 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.599
 pass in this clarity the time set importance percent goes 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.399
 many work privately 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.340
 Percent or self-define groups 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 you have percent then the thing went to look after work tasks privately 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.160
 for talents what he marked focused or in the ones and everything 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.220
 that's what 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.690
 Percent what is not fixed yet there is probably in Escobar you can order is a text 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.010
 set the whole synchronize with their various services 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.680
 in the single could also 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.610
 take a lot of 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.830
 To weighty voice or sweeping task than at that time could do the projects 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.840
 is also called colleague Thomas Tuchel shopping lists are sometimes points 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.510
 or smoke time so indyMac he came as an example the arm Jada 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 Ellie also gives Kuzmanovic l to Sweden 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.510
 but send the experiment 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.970
 Of course, as a penniless percent you can 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.170
 at the net lets task 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.470
 there are differences but this is not the case now 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.760
 but after one had already failed 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.270
 that would be the case - otherwise 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.100
 could then be synonymous later halftime and the like 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.440
 While doing so, one comes to edit the chefs to add a new list or one 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.420
 from the embankment 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.859
 around the numbers 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.750
 the one how much too big 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.190
 to do are 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.550

 yes at the airfield like no bank so it will visit from unloaded class 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.850
 and this one 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.110
 Opticians like it very much 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.510
