there<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:08.060> does<00:02:08.270> run<00:02:08.479> off<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> doublea's<00:02:09.640> you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there it does run off a doublea's you

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.060 
there it does run off a doublea's you
pull<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.480> right<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.800> comes

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070

I<00:02:33.070> get<00:02:34.070> max<00:02:34.340> brightness<00:02:34.780> well<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.900> actually

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
I get max brightness well it actually

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.479 
I get max brightness well it actually

you<00:02:40.489> get<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> strobe<00:02:42.010> if<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.970> easier<00:02:44.300> for<00:02:44.360> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you get a strobe if it's easier for you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
to get to the bottom part you get the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.690

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630

the<00:02:53.720> same<00:02:53.930> thing<00:02:54.230> but<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.650> strobe<00:02:55.010> if<00:02:55.489> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
the same thing but you get strobe if you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.100 
the same thing but you get strobe if you
hit<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.850> twice<00:02:56.890> strobe<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.360> got<00:02:59.480> momentary

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
hit it twice strobe so you got momentary
