00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 friends today will be the shortest 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.340
 review on the most crazy game that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 I happened to see why short yes 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 everything is just nothing to say here 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 your whole gameplay will be reduced loud mat 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.470
 and the desire to put your device on one 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 brick and the second from above as before the general 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 Now you understand what's what channel 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.289
 pdalife is a video review of the game 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.289
 chores 3rd floor 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.350
 I'll start smirnov game is 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.480
 platformer although I would even say runner 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.399
 where is the geometric figure that is you 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.800
 trying to complete levels 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.079
 avoiding obstacles in the form of other figures 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.899
 all you have to do in this game is 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.989
 just jump well, that's the whole thing 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.269
 Trouble screen device is not a joystick where 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.909
 button pressing time is almost instant and 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.009
 here that damn not sickly delay there is 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.990
 the standards of this game because our cube 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.060
 racing forward at a speed of proud 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.759
 falcon and time between jumps sometimes 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.479
 makes up a split second to something in between 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.399
 jumps 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.350
 sometimes you have to jump so that in 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.140
 top do not hook and for this 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.569
 need an ideal trajectory in general i 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.270
 getting to the fact that this game is to play without 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.350
 guests to themselves are more precious than khan and psyche and 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.740
 my device seems to have strong nerves 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.080
 but when in a minute I went to 15 set 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.630
 I realized that it was time to cut down the shooting 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.119
 shoot then there will be nothing on this 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.060
 you have no limits on the game 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.709
 life after game and things like that 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.569
 Donata is not paid and you can 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.670
 repeat entry level exactly as much 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.160
 how much your mind 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.280
 even if you think the author is noob and 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.379
 I can not play, I recommend trying 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.020
 I myself also thought firstly 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:05.690
 that everything is easy but then I realized that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.970
 I have not seen hardcore by myself 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.280
 game simple graphics is not like 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
 such a generally stupid figure colored background 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.629
 although the sound is at the same level and in 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.879
 each zone, it is also in the game 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.129
 there is a map editor you can 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.319
 create your own route and 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.599
 invite him to go to a friend with a malicious 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.340
 smile they say come on let's try 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.160
 writing beer squeezed 30 rubles 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.959
 the suit will be cruel only with this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.629
 make sure you let him play not 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.200
 yours and on his phone then months 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.700
 may be even sweeter but you understand what 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.610
 I 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.250
 But in general, more about the game to tell you 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.040
 and nothing on the one hand is easier than the guy 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.989
 turnips and on the other brain removal from the whole 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.319
 the skull is talking like spirit 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.730
 people with weak psyche this game 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.220
 contraindicated in general but for those who 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.040
 believes that his iron will that same 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.530
 Check out such alena you iron on 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900
 in fact, she was in sync with you 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.590
 kinat and geometry dash hunt review 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.590
 soon
