your attention to this 21 inch wheel the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
your attention to this 21 inch wheel the
bigger<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.540> doc<00:00:42.719> wanted<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.200> he

still wanted to look like a bagger you
can<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> line<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.550> fender

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
can see this line right here this fender

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.630 
can see this line right here this fender
is<00:00:48.149> 14<00:00:48.600> gauge<00:00:48.840> steel<00:00:48.870> comes<00:00:49.770> ecoute<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.370> ready

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is 14 gauge steel comes ecoute it ready

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 
is 14 gauge steel comes ecoute it ready
to<00:00:50.820> bolt<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.809> back<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.500> flared<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to bolt on the back of it is flared just

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
to bolt on the back of it is flared just
so<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.940> matches<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> rear<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> fender

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
so it matches the the rear of the fender

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
so it matches the the rear of the fender
so<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> doesn't<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> boring<00:00:57.480> cutoff

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
so it doesn't have that boring cutoff

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
so it doesn't have that boring cutoff
down<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> bottom<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> makes<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.789> look

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
down on the bottom but it makes it look

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
down on the bottom but it makes it look
longer<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> stretch<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.410> inch<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
longer and stretch there's an inch and a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.319 
longer and stretch there's an inch and a
half<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.430> back<00:01:02.609> section<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.300> here

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
half in the back section right here

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.780 
half in the back section right here
which<00:01:04.110> suddenly<00:01:04.320> gives<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> lowered<00:01:05.549> bike

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
which suddenly gives you a lowered bike

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.130 
which suddenly gives you a lowered bike
feeling<00:01:06.299> even<00:01:06.450> though<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
feeling even though you have the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.320 
feeling even though you have the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
absolute amount of ground clearance that

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.219 
absolute amount of ground clearance that
anybody<00:01:09.630> else<00:01:09.810> does

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
anybody else does

anybody else does
while<00:01:10.860> he<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.130> having<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.460> painted<00:01:11.850> he<00:01:12.270> also

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
while he was having this painted he also

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
while he was having this painted he also
decided<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.990> our<00:01:13.200> Undercovers<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.430> check

decided to our Undercovers you can check

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.740 
decided to our Undercovers you can check
that<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.479> there's<00:01:15.659> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that out right down here there's a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.690 
that out right down here there's a
little<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.470> blue<00:01:16.770> color<00:01:17.009> which

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
little bit more of that blue color which

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
little bit more of that blue color which
just<00:01:18.000> extends<00:01:18.509> into<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> line<00:01:19.110> suddenly<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
just extends into that line suddenly it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.380 
just extends into that line suddenly it
brings<00:01:20.009> everything<00:01:20.310> front<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.060> adds

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
brings everything front to back adds

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
brings everything front to back adds
that<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> color<00:01:22.590> sandwiches<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that little bit of color sandwiches that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.580 
that little bit of color sandwiches that
beautiful<00:01:23.790> v-twin<00:01:24.150> motor<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.320> makes<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
beautiful v-twin motor and just makes a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.420 
beautiful v-twin motor and just makes a
huge<00:01:25.740> difference

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
huge difference

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
huge difference
so<00:01:26.580> sometimes<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> little<00:01:27.479> stuff<00:01:27.869> like

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so sometimes it's the little stuff like

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
so sometimes it's the little stuff like
this<00:01:28.770> flush<00:01:29.070> mount<00:01:29.310> axle<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> fork<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
this flush mount axle this fork and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
this flush mount axle this fork and
finish<00:01:30.479> piece<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.020> under<00:01:31.259> cover<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
finish piece and this under cover that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
finish piece and this under cover that
makes<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> difference<00:01:33.049> up<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
makes all the difference up here on the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
makes all the difference up here on the
top<00:01:34.770> side<00:01:35.009> we've<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:35.549> eighth<00:01:35.790> inch<00:01:36.000> rope
