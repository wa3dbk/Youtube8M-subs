00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.820
 hello to all today reviewed with a 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.890
 super robot show cooking so from home 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.480
 bandaÃ¯ it's just going to say 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.250
 an alternative range is a little bit 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.869
 less expensive to the soul of show cooking 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.060
 precisely from this same brand 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.160
 we end up with greenzer who is in 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.010
 do it with us simply goldorak 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.000
 we registered our little box with it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.590
 do not pay a lot of mines 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.300
 but it's still quite pretty 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.370
 behind you can see how that is 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 a few simply move that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.880
 can do to him who are just fired 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.989
 from the Serie 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.250
 also we will have some gimmicks 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.290
 provided of what is still quite 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.240
 nice we're also going to be that the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.070
 points are detachable and who has 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.690
 also already and we'll see that a little 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.160
 a little closer then simply 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.840
 the frames in the water that are 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.070
 absolutely ready to receive 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.380
 different vehicles that can get 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.270
 wear out clipping on our friend 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.939
 gradinger is shaped a little bit 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.979
 of effort med actually big footing 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.920
 shoulders a little bit more a little bit more 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.270
 mastoc we're going to have like that every 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.950
 little guennic the pairs of hands 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.360
 we have here the instructions 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.290
 so we see that it's not 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.270
 soul of naughty show 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.009
 it is a mint leaflet in black and white 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.719
 any beasts can really delivered 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.939
 qualitative 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.499
 the rest of the accessories we have 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.140
 there with asteroids pm 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.490
 we're going here it's big but then 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.289
 necessarily plastic crowd 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.520
 by cons we'll see what still 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.869
 a little bit of metal in the figurine 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.719
 who know how nice that is who does 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.850
 its weight the torso partly the metal 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.280
 is actually mostly people who are going 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.590
 really weigh it down is really enough 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.619
 nice it's a little more at least 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.119
 like that he will hold well we see if the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.210
 joints but are still pretty 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 well concealed we also have the levis 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.799
 like that are pretty well hidden good here 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.270
 go apparent 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.709
 I do what he is fit to a little 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.329
 of med effort he's going to have a head a 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.579
 little bit small by cons it's a 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.499
 little weird but hey it still 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.200
 pretty much not the only thing that is 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.729
 really a little bit unsightly then 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.860
 that yet we have vices almost 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.520
 any case in good except this one but 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.680
 it's not very bad 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.959
 it's actually here as you can see 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.670
 the top at the shoulder 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.020
 it's the system there so here is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.920
 yellow stripes that could be 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.720
 high notebooks 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.879
 there they used us this system there 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 why good question what is a 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.129
 little bit unsightly but hey it's not 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.959
 very mean 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.330
 this is the only little flaw will say in 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.890
 any case for the moment visual by the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.390
 looking a little closer we can 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.599
 so admire the details 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.159
 the chrome narrates against the horns 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.299
 they are simply golden math 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.590
 it's all in one piece 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.239
 at least that will hold what is already 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.400
 still not bad since everything is 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.439
 completely molded and could be seen 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 this is the lightning is pretty tortured and 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:58.610
 more beautiful effect in the movements we go 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.860
 have of course the head so the top but 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.319
 also the base of the neck all have to those 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.360
 of bo jones here then you see everything from 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.730
 after the questions ask me even if it is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.920
 clip s are pretty easily so at 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.760
 be careful we will see the poles here 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.610
 so it's still pretty stiff 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.469
 they have just been unpacked 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.290
 here it's going to be blocked we're going to have the 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.099
 there you go who will turn the hand 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.409
 move and precisely at the elbow 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:32.569
 you have a system actually like this 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.180
 it jumps and who will pay like that of good 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.260
 forgetful just went there then to 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.299
 to be careful is still enough 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.829
 rigid but that's how it departs 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.200
 fir tree like that not to interfere with everything 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.640
 simply the articulation 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.290
 we're going to come back a little bit more 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.129
 in details that you can actually see 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.739
 it's a double elbow 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.409
 you have little to what you see 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.469
 actually who the first bocholt this is who 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.939
 already allows then so here it is the 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.370
 little click you hear that allows the 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:00.319
 first move and after you have 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.719
 this part there that actually allows the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.599
 second is so to go a little bit 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.260
 further actually because beast 90 degrees 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.079
 for the torso 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.760
 we have the upper part at the level of 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:17.109
 basin here for the legs so it moves 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.579
 still pretty good rotation also 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.470
 for the knee actually you see 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.500
 behind this part there as sakineh 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.430
 is a hole it's a bit unsightly 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.680
 but you hear here you have a 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.930
 good not good ratchet forgiveness by bolt volt 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.740
 who should like that will make a beautiful 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.740
 joints 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.000
 for the foot here your jones here that 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.070
 move pretty well and the same one has a 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.890
 second small step that allows 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.150
 to go a little further the poles 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.830
 can still be a little out 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.380
 then not backwards but towards 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.850
 forward like that which allowed as 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.410
 to give a little more 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:53.980
 of amplitude and bring all 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.600
 simply the arm at the torso 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.400
 our friend actually is not addicted but 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.080
 since in this version it is matte 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.330
 in the end it does not hurt 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.830
 it is true that I still have a long time 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.140
 hesitated with the soul of show version 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.820
 cooking who is you still a lot 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.490
 more metal that is just you 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.990
 compares to a lot prettier but a 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.610
 small compared to the two sizes here 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.760
 with a max at the eye so it's home 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.350
 mc factory with kaiser martin a lot 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.850
 more metal a lot more details 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.260
 normal the range is totally 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.790
 different it's really made for 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.330
 directly compete with the soul of 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.130
 naughty show 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.900
 let's not forget that it's super robot 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.510
 naughty show on versions a little 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.440
 lighter in quotes that this 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.690
 either in terms of weight or even 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.980
 just details but it allows 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.710
 to still have handsome hangers 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.530
 well finished poem at a pretty good price 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.780
 still not negligible for the arm 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.000
 adding this rod to remove that's not 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.010
 more stupid little harder than that one 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.960
 is the host and 1.6 to allow like that 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.910
 to give these are the little functions 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.430
 little geeks to find everything 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.670
 simply the series for the hands a 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.570
 little calf john you see there detached 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.680
 so be careful with the remitters 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:03.650
 because the peaks it's still 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.440
 badly enough like that always the asters 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.370
 work that is saved 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.410
 precisely speaking of her we will be able to 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.550
 Put them 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.050
 so we could have seen and come in 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.770
 two parts if it appears like that 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.730
 just that the assemblies tears he is 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.160
 maybe not metal 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.600
 it is in full plastic but with the 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.420
 chrome and it allows like that to pass 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.770
 and give a little extra stamp 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.270
 for the bailiwick horns you attract 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.870
 on each side it takes away at its 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:37.460
 ears and un, but news like 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:40.670
 this ends with the last said mic 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:45.890
 so we're going to pull the arm again 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:49.400
 so we'll put that smoke and the 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:56.600
 flames and we will put the end 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:58.580
 last part so we have what a 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.170
 good rendering so we could see this is 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.610
 not entirely white have it here this 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.190
 little hang out in the middle that gives a 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.860
 little extra side this is 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.510
 waved a bit everywhere 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.820
 here we will see transparent species 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.310
 but with the gradient that really makes 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.510
 really nice as I could 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.630
 to understand is a range really 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.620
 friendly still quite affordable that has 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.810
 allowed like that to have anyway 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.130
 some details and do all the same 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.650
 always pleasure without too much 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.240
 spend simply hoping low 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.430
 with the remains of the accessories follow 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.050
 that is venusia chalco rac and everything 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.580
 what goes with all the clique for 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.040
 just like that and by the way a little 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.660
 little and just fed up redo the 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.550
 display that was created with the soul 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:41.140
 of naughty show at the time I you 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.140
 would say next hi hi 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.530
 m
